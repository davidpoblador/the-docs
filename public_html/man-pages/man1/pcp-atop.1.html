      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<p>The program <strong>pcp-atop</strong> is an interactive monitor to view various aspects of load on a system. It shows the occupation of the most critical hardware resources (from a performance point of view) on system level, i.e. cpu, memory, disk and network.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>It also shows which processes are responsible for the indicated load with respect to cpu and memory load on process level. Disk load is shown per process if "storage accounting" is active in the kernel.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>Every <em>interval</em> (default: 10 seconds) information is shown about the resource occupation on system level (cpu, memory, disks and network layers), followed by a list of processes which have been active during the last interval (note that all processes that were unchanged during the last interval are not shown, unless the key 'a' has been pressed). If the list of active processes does not entirely fit on the screen, only the top of the list is shown (sorted in order of activity).</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>The intervals are repeated till the number of <em>samples</em> (specified as command argument) is reached, or till the key 'q' is pressed in interactive mode.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>When invoked via the <a href="../man1/pcp.1.html"><strong>pcp</strong>(1)</a> command, the <strong>PCPIntro</strong>(1) options <strong>-h</strong>/<strong>.BR</strong>--host<strong>,</strong> <strong>-a</strong>/<strong>.BR</strong>--archive<strong>,</strong> <strong>-O</strong>/<strong>.BR</strong>--origin<strong>,</strong> <strong>-s</strong>/<strong>.BR</strong>--samples<strong>,</strong> <strong>-t</strong>/<strong>.BR</strong>--interval<strong>,</strong> <strong>-Z</strong>/<strong>.BR</strong>--timezone and several other <em>pcp options</em> become indirectly available.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>When <strong>pcp-atop</strong> is started, it checks whether the standard output channel is connected to a screen, or to a file/pipe. In the first case it produces screen control codes (via the ncurses library) and behaves interactively; in the second case it produces flat ASCII-output.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>In interactive mode, the output of <strong>pcp-atop</strong> scales dynamically to the current dimensions of the screen/window.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>If the window is resized horizontally, columns will be added or removed automatically. For this purpose, every column has a particular weight. The columns with the highest weights that fit within the current width will be shown.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>If the window is resized vertically, lines of the process/thread list will be added or removed automatically.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>Furthermore in interactive mode the output of <strong>pcp-atop</strong> can be controlled by pressing particular keys. However it is also possible to specify such key as <strong>flag</strong> on the command line. In that case <strong>pcp-atop</strong> switches to the indicated mode on beforehand; this mode can be modified again interactively. Specifying such key as flag is especially useful when running <strong>pcp-atop</strong> with output to a pipe or file (non-interactively). These flags are the same as the keys that can be pressed in interactive mode (see section INTERACTIVE COMMANDS).</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>Additional flags are available to support storage of <strong>pcp-atop</strong> data in PCP archive format (see section PCP DATA STORAGE).</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">COLORS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<p>For the resource consumption on system level, <strong>pcp-atop</strong> uses colors to indicate that a critical occupation percentage has been (almost) reached. A critical occupation percentage means that is likely that this load causes a noticeable negative performance influence for applications using this resource. The critical percentage depends on the type of resource: e.g. the performance influence of a disk with a busy percentage of 80% might be more noticeable for applications/user than a CPU with a busy percentage of 90%.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>Currently <strong>pcp-atop</strong> uses the following default values to calculate a weighted percentage per resource:</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <dl class='dl-vertical'>
    <dt><strong>&nbsp;Processor</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>A busy percentage of 90% or higher is considered `critical'.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>&nbsp;Disk</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>A busy percentage of 70% or higher is considered `critical'.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>&nbsp;Network</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>A busy percentage of 90% or higher for the load of an interface is considered `critical'.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>&nbsp;Memory</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>An occupation percentage of 90% is considered `critical'. Notice that this occupation percentage is the accumulated memory consumption of the kernel (including slab) and all processes; the memory for the page cache (`cache' and `buff' in the MEM-line) and the reclaimable part of the slab (`slrec`) is not implied!</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>If the number of pages swapped out (`swout' in the PAG-line) is larger than 10 per second, the memory resource is considered `critical'. A value of at least 1 per second is considered `almost critical'.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>If the committed virtual memory exceeds the limit (`vmcom' and `vmlim' in the SWP-line), the SWP-line is colored due to overcommitting the system.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>&nbsp;Swap</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>An occupation percentage of 80% is considered `critical' because swap space might be completely exhausted in the near future; it is not critical from a performance point-of-view.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>These default values can be modified in the configuration file (see separate man-page of pcp-atoprc).</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>When a resource exceeds its critical occupation percentage, the concerning values in the screen line are colored red by default.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>When a resource exceeded (default) 80% of its critical percentage (so it is almost critical), the concerning values in the screen line are colored cyan by default. This `almost critical percentage' (one value for all resources) can be modified in the configuration file (see separate man-page of pcp-atoprc).</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>The default colors red and cyan can be modified in the configuration file as well (see separate man-page of pcp-atoprc).</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>With the key 'x' (or flag -x), the use of colors can be suppressed.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">INTERACTIVE COMMANDS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<p>When running <strong>pcp-atop</strong> interactively (no output redirection), keys can be pressed to control the output. In general, lower case keys can be used to show other information for the active processes and upper case keys can be used to influence the sort order of the active process/thread list.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">PCP DATA STORAGE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<p>In order to store system and process level statistics for long-term analysis (e.g. to check the system load and the active processes running yesterday between 3:00 and 4:00 PM), <strong>pcp-atop</strong> can store the system and process level statistics in the PCP archive format, as an archive folio (see <a href="../man1/mkaf.1.html"><strong>mkaf</strong>(1)</a>).</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>By default only processes which have been active during the interval are stored in the raw file. When the flag <strong>-a</strong> is specified, all processes will be stored.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>The interval (default: 10 seconds) and number of samples (default: infinite) can be passed as last arguments. Instead of the number of samples, the flag <strong>-S</strong> can be used to indicate that <strong>pcp-atop</strong> should finish anyhow before midnight.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>A PCP archive can be read and visualized again with the flag <strong>-r .</strong> The argument is a comma-separated list of names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or the name of a directory containing one or more archives. If no argument is specified, the file <strong>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/HOST/YYYYMMDD</strong> is opened for input (where <em>YYYYMMDD</em> are digits representing the current date, and HOST is the hostname of the machine being logged). If a filename is specified in the format YYYYMMDD (representing any valid date), the file <strong>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/HOST/YYYYMMDD</strong> is opened. If a filename with the symbolic name <strong>y</strong> is specified, yesterday's daily logfile is opened (this can be repeated so 'yyyy' indicates the logfile of four days ago).</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>The samples from the file can be viewed interactively by using the key 't' to show the next sample, the key 'T' to show the previous sample, the key 'b' to branch to a particular time or the key 'r' to rewind to the begin of the file.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>When output is redirected to a file or pipe, <strong>pcp-atop</strong> prints all samples in plain ASCII. The default line length is 80 characters in that case; with the flag <strong>-L</strong> followed by an alternate line length, more (or less) columns will be shown.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>With the flag <strong>-b</strong> (begin time) and/or <strong>-e</strong> (end time) followed by a time argument of the form HH:MM, a certain time period within the raw file can be selected.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OUTPUT DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<p>The first sample shows the system level activity since boot (the elapsed time in the header shows the time since boot). Note that particular counters could have reached their maximum value (several times) and started by zero again, so do not rely on these figures.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>For every sample <strong>pcp-atop</strong> first shows the lines related to system level activity. If a particular system resource has not been used during the interval, the entire line related to this resource is suppressed. So the number of system level lines may vary for each sample.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>After that a list is shown of processes which have been active during the last interval. This list is by default sorted on cpu consumption, but this order can be changed by the keys which are previously described.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>If values have to be shown by <strong>pcp-atop</strong> which do not fit in the column width, another format is used. If e.g. a cpu-consumption of 233216 milliseconds should be shown in a column width of 4 positions, it is shown as `233s' (in seconds). For large memory figures, another unit is chosen if the value does not fit (Mb instead of Kb, Gb instead of Mb, Tb instead of Gb, ...). For other values, a kind of exponent notation is used (value 123456789 shown in a column of 5 positions gives 123e6).</p>

<p class='spacer'>

  <dl class='dl-vertical'>
    <dt><strong>PRC</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Process and thread level totals.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>This line contains the total cpu time consumed in system mode (`sys') and in user mode (`user'), the total number of processes present at this moment (`#proc'), the total number of threads present at this moment in state `running' (`#trun'), `sleeping interruptible' (`#tslpi') and `sleeping uninterruptible' (`#tslpu'), the number of zombie processes (`#zombie'), the number of clone system calls (`clones'), and the number of processes that ended during the interval (`#exit') when process accounting is used. Instead of `#exit` the last column may indicate that process accounting could not be activated (`no procacct`).</p>

  <p>CPU utilization.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>At least one line is shown for the total occupation of all CPUs together.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>In case of a multi-processor system, an additional line is shown for every individual processor (with `cpu' in lower case), sorted on activity. Inactive CPUs will not be shown by default. The lines showing the per-cpu occupation contain the cpu number in the last field.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>Every line contains the percentage of cpu time spent in kernel mode by all active processes (`sys'), the percentage of cpu time consumed in user mode (`user') for all active processes (including processes running with a nice value larger than zero), the percentage of cpu time spent for interrupt handling (`irq') including softirq, the percentage of unused cpu time while no processes were waiting for disk-I/O (`idle'), and the percentage of unused cpu time while at least one process was waiting for disk-I/O (`wait').</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>In case of per-cpu occupation, the last column shows the cpu number and the wait percentage (`w') for that cpu. The number of lines showing the per-cpu occupation can be limited.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>For virtual machines the steal-percentage is shown (`steal'), reflecting the percentage of cpu time stolen by other virtual machines running on the same hardware.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>For physical machines hosting one or more virtual machines, the guest-percentage is shown (`guest'), reflecting the percentage of cpu time used by the virtual machines. Notice that this percentage overlaps the user-percentage.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>In case of frequency-scaling, all previously mentioned CPU-percentages are relative to the used scaling of the CPU during the interval. If a CPU has been active for e.g. 50% in user mode during the interval while the frequency-scaling of that CPU was 40%, only 20% of the full capacity of the CPU has been used in user mode.</p>

<p class='spacer'>

  <p>Every process shares resident memory with other processes. E.g. when a particular program is started several times, the code pages (text) are only loaded once in memory and shared by all incarnations. Also the code of shared libraries is shared by all processes using that shared library, as well as shared memory and memory-mapped files. For the PSIZE calculation of a process, the resident memory of a process that is shared with other processes is divided by the number of sharers. This means, that every process is accounted for a proportional part of that memory. Accumulating the PSIZE values of all processes in the system gives a reliable impression of the total resident memory consumed by all processes.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>Since gathering of all values that are needed to calculate the PSIZE is a relatively time-consuming task, the 'R' key (or '-R' flag) should be active. Gathering these values also requires superuser privileges (otherwise '?K' is shown in the output).</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">

<p>With the flag <strong>-P</strong> followed by a list of one or more labels (comma-separated), parseable output is produced for each sample. The labels that can be specified for system-level statistics correspond to the labels (first verb of each line) that can be found in the interactive output: "CPU", "cpu" "CPL" "MEM", "SWP", "PAG", "LVM", "MDD", "DSK", "NFM", "NFC", "NFS" and "NET".</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>For process-level statistics special labels are introduced: "PRG" (general), "PRC" (cpu), "PRM" (memory), "PRD" (disk, only if "storage accounting" is active) and "PRN" (network, only if the kernel module 'netatop' has been installed).</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>With the label "ALL", all system and process level statistics are shown.</p>

<p>For every interval all requested lines are shown whereafter <strong>pcp-atop</strong> shows a line just containing the label "SEP" as a separator before the lines for the next sample are generated.</p>

<p>When a sample contains the values since boot, <strong>pcp-atop</strong> shows a line just containing the label "RESET" before the lines for this sample are generated.</p>

<p><strong>pcp-atop</strong> is based on the source code of the <strong>atop</strong>(1) command from <em>http://atoptool.nl</em> and aims to be command line and output compatible with it as much as possible. Some features of that <strong>atop</strong> command are not available in <strong>pcp-atop</strong>.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>Some features of <strong>pcp-atop</strong> (such as reporting on the Apache HTTP daemon, and NFS client mounts) are only activated if the corresonding PCP metrics are available. Refer to the documentation for <a href="../man1/pmdaapache.1.html"><strong>pmdaapache</strong>(1)</a> and <a href="../man1/pmdanfsclient.1.html"><strong>pmdanfsclient</strong>(1)</a> for further details on activating these metrics.</p>
