<p>The \*(WE program provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system. It can display<strong> system</strong> summary information as well as a list of \*(TT currently being managed by the Linux kernel. The types of system summary information shown and the types, order and size of information displayed for processes are all user configurable and that configuration can be made persistent across restarts.</p><p>The program provides a limited interactive interface for process manipulation as well as a much more extensive interface for personal configuration \*(Em encompassing every aspect of its operation. And while \*(WE is referred to throughout this document, you are free to name the program anything you wish. That new name, possibly an alias, will then be reflected on \*(We's display and used when reading and writing a \*(CF.</p>

<h3>Operation</h3>
<p>When operating \*(We, the two most important keys are the help (h or ?) key and quit (`q') key. Alternatively, you could simply use the traditional interrupt key (^C) when you're done.</p><p>When started for the first time, you'll be presented with these traditional elements on the main \*(We screen: 1) Summary Area; 2) Fields/Columns Header; 3) Task Area. Each of these will be explored in the sections that follow. There is also an Input/Message line between the Summary Area and Columns Header which needs no further explanation.</p><p>The main \*(We screen is <em>generally</em> quite adaptive to changes in terminal dimensions under X-Windows. Other \*(We screens may be less so, especially those with static text. It ultimately depends, however, on your particular window manager and terminal emulator. There may be occasions when their view of terminal size and current contents differs from \*(We's view, which is always based on operating system calls.</p><p>Following any re-size operation, if a \*(We screen is corrupted, appears incomplete or disordered, simply typing something innocuous like a punctuation character or cursor motion key will usually restore it. In extreme cases, the following sequence almost certainly will:</p>
<pre>
       <em>key/cmd  objective </em>
       ^Z       <strong>suspend</strong> \*(We
       fg       <strong>resume</strong> \*(We
       &lt;Left&gt;   force a screen <strong>redraw</strong> (if necessary)
</pre>
<p>But if the display is still corrupted, there is one more step you could try. Insert this command after \*(We has been suspended but before resuming it.</p>
<pre>
       <em>key/cmd  objective </em>
       reset    restore your <strong>terminal settings</strong>
</pre>
<p>\*(NT the width of \*(We's display will be limited to \*(WX positions. Displaying all fields requires \*(WF characters. Remaining screen width is usually allocated to any variable width columns currently visible. The variable width columns, such as COMMAND, are noted in topic 3a. DESCRIPTIONS of Fields. Actual output width may also be influenced by the -w switch, which is discussed in topic 1. COMMAND-LINE Options.</p><p>Lastly, some of \*(We's screens or functions require the use of cursor motion keys like the standard \*(KAs plus the Home, End, PgUp and PgDn keys. If your terminal or emulator does not provide those keys, the following combinations are accepted as alternatives:</p>
<pre>
      <em> key      equivalent-key-combinations </em>
       Up       alt +<strong> &#92;</strong>      or  alt +<strong> k </strong>
       Down     alt +<strong> /</strong>      or  alt +<strong> j </strong>
       Left     alt +<strong> &lt;</strong>      or  alt +<strong> h </strong>
       Right    alt +<strong> &gt;</strong>      or  alt +<strong> l </strong>(lower case L)
       PgUp     alt +<strong> Up</strong>     or  alt + ctrl +<strong> k </strong>
       PgDn     alt +<strong> Down</strong>   or  alt + ctrl +<strong> j </strong>
       Home     alt +<strong> Left</strong>   or  alt + ctrl +<strong> h </strong>
       End      alt +<strong> Right</strong>  or  alt + ctrl +<strong> l </strong>
</pre>
<p>The <strong>Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> \*(KAs have special significance when prompted for line input terminated with the &lt;Enter&gt; key. Those keys, or their aliases, can be used to retrieve previous input lines which can then be edited and re-input. And there are four additional keys available with line oriented input.</p>
<pre>
      <em> key      special-significance </em>
       Up       recall <strong>older</strong> strings for re-editing
       Down     recall <strong>newer</strong> strings or <strong>erase</strong> entire line
       Insert   toggle between <strong>insert</strong> and <strong>overtype</strong> modes
       Delete   character <strong>removed</strong> at cursor, moving others left
       Home     jump to <strong>beginning</strong> of input line
       End      jump to <strong>end</strong> of input line
</pre>

<h3>Startup Defaults</h3>
<p>The following startup defaults assume no \*(CF, thus no user customizations. Even so, items shown with an \*(AK could be overridden through the command-line. All are explained in detail in the sections that follow.</p>
<pre>
    <em>Global-defaults</em>
       A - Alt display      Off (full-screen)
     * d - Delay time       1.5 seconds
     * H - Threads mode     Off (summarize as tasks)
       I - Irix mode        On  (no, `solaris' smp)
     * p - PID monitoring   Off (show all processes)
     * s - Secure mode      Off (unsecured)
       B - Bold enable      On  (yes, bold globally)
    <em>Summary-Area-defaults</em>
       l - Load Avg/Uptime  On  (thus program name)
       t - Task/Cpu states  On  (1+1 lines, see `1')
       m - Mem/Swap usage   On  (2 lines worth)
       1 - Single Cpu       Off (thus multiple cpus)
    <em>Task-Area-defaults</em>
       b - Bold hilite      Off (use `reverse')
     * c - Command line     Off (name, not cmdline)
     * i - Idle tasks       On  (show all tasks)
       J - Num align right  On  (not left justify)
       j - Str align right  Off (not right justify)
       R - Reverse sort     On  (pids high-to-low)
     * S - Cumulative time  Off (no, dead children)
     * u - User filter      Off (show euid only)
     * U - User filter      Off (show any uid)
       V - Forest view      On  (show as branches)
       x - Column hilite    Off (no, sort field)
       y - Row hilite       On  (yes, running tasks)
       z - color/mono       On  (show colors)
</pre>

<h3>Linux Memory Types</h3>
<p>For our purposes there are three types of memory, and one is optional. First is \*(MP, a limited resource where code and data must reside when executed or referenced. Next is the optional \*(MS, where modified (dirty) memory can be saved and later retrieved if too many demands are made on \*(MP. Lastly we have \*(MV, a nearly unlimited resource serving the following goals:</p>
<pre>
   1. abstraction, free from physical memory addresses/limits
   2. isolation, every process in a separate address space
   3. sharing, a single mapping can serve multiple needs
   4. flexibility, assign a virtual address to a file
</pre>
<p>Regardless of which of these forms memory may take, all are managed as pages (typically 4096 bytes) but expressed by default in \*(We as KiB (kibibyte). The memory discussed under topic `2c. MEMORY Usage' deals with \*(MP and the \*(MS for the system as a whole. The memory reviewed in topic `3. FIELDS / Columns Display' embraces all three memory types, but for individual processes.</p><p>For each such process, every memory page is restricted to a single quadrant from the table below. Both \*(MP and \*(MV can include any of the four, while the \*(MS only includes #1 through #3. The memory in quadrant #4, when modified, acts as its own dedicated \*(MS.</p>
<pre>
                              <strong>Private</strong> | <strong>Shared</strong>
                          <strong>1</strong>           |          <strong>2</strong>
     <strong>Anonymous</strong>  . stack               |
                . malloc()            |
                . brk()/sbrk()        | . POSIX shm*
                . mmap(PRIVATE, ANON) | . mmap(SHARED, ANON)
               -----------------------+----------------------
                . mmap(PRIVATE, fd)   | . mmap(SHARED, fd)
   <strong>File-backed</strong>  . pgms/shared libs    |
                          <strong>3</strong>           |          <strong>4</strong>
</pre>
<p>The following may help in interpreting process level memory values displayed as scalable columns and discussed under topic `3a. DESCRIPTIONS of Fields'.</p>
<pre>
   %MEM - simply RES divided by total \*(MP
   CODE - the `pgms' portion of quadrant <strong>3</strong>
   DATA - the entire quadrant <strong>1</strong> portion of VIRT plus all
          explicit mmap file-backed pages of quadrant <strong>3</strong>
   RES  - anything occupying \*(MP which, beginning with
          Linux-4.5, is the sum of the following three fields:
          RSan - quadrant <strong>1</strong> pages, which include any
                 former quadrant <strong>3</strong> pages if modified
          RSfd - quadrant <strong>3</strong> and quadrant <strong>4</strong> pages
          RSsh - quadrant <strong>2</strong> pages
   RSlk - subset of RES which cannot be swapped out (any quadrant)
   SHR  - subset of RES (excludes <strong>1</strong>, includes all <strong>2</strong> & <strong>4</strong>, some <strong>3</strong>)
   SWAP - potentially any quadrant except <strong>4</strong>
   USED - simply the sum of RES and SWAP
   VIRT - everything in-use and/or reserved (all quadrants)
</pre>
<p>\*(NT Even though program images and shared libraries are considered <em>private</em> to a process, they will be accounted for as <em>shared</em> (SHR) by the kernel.</p>

<h3>4a. GLOBAL Commands</h3>
<p>The global \*(CIs are<strong> always</strong> available in both \*(FM and \*(AM. However, some of these \*(CIs are<strong> not available</strong> when running in Secure mode.</p><p>If you wish to know in advance whether or not your \*(We has been secured, simply ask for help and view the system summary on the second line.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<strong>Enter</strong>&gt; or &lt;<strong>Space</strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Refresh-Display </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>These commands awaken \*(We and following receipt of any input the entire display will be repainted. They also force an update of any hotplugged \*(Pu or \*(MP changes.</p><p>Use either of these keys if you have a large delay interval and wish to see current status,</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>?</strong> | <strong>h</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Help </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There are two help levels available. The first will provide a reminder of all the basic \*(CIs. If \*(We is<em> secured</em>, that screen will be abbreviated.</p><p>Typing `h' or `?' on that help screen will take you to help for those \*(CIs applicable to \*(AM.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>=</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Exit-Task-Limits </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Removes restrictions on which tasks are shown. This command will reverse any `i' (idle tasks) and `n' (max tasks) commands that might be active. It also provides for an exit from PID monitoring, User filtering, Other filtering and Locate processing. See the `-p' \*(CO for a discussion of PID monitoring, the `U' or `u' \*(CIs for User filtering the `O' or `o' \*(CIs for Other filtering and `L' or `&' \*(CIs for Locate processing.</p><p>Additionally, any window that has been scrolled will be reset with this command. \*(XT 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information regarding vertical and horizontal scrolling.</p><p>When operating in \*(AM this command has a broader meaning.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>0</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Zero-Suppress</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This command determines whether zeros are shown or suppressed for many of the fields in a \*(TW. Fields like UID, GID, NI, PR or P are not affected by this toggle.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Alternate-Display-Mode</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This command will switch between \*(FM and \*(AM. \*(XT 5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provisions and the `g' \*(CI for insight into \*(CWs and \*(FGs.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Bold-Disable/Enable</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This command will influence use of the bold terminfo capability and alters<strong> both</strong> the \*(SA and \*(TA for the \*(CW. While it is intended primarily for use with dumb terminals, it can be applied anytime.</p><p>\*(NT When this toggle is \*O and \*(We is operating in monochrome mode, the<strong> entire display</strong> will appear as normal text. Thus, unless the `x' and/or `y' toggles are using reverse for emphasis, there will be no visual confirmation that they are even on.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>d</strong> | <strong>s</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Change-Delay-Time-interval </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You will be prompted to enter the delay time, in seconds, between display updates.</p><p>Fractional seconds are honored, but a negative number is not allowed. Entering 0 causes (nearly) continuous updates, with an unsatisfactory display as the system and tty driver try to keep up with \*(We's demands. The delay value is inversely proportional to system loading, so set it with care.</p><p>If at any time you wish to know the current delay time, simply ask for help and view the system summary on the second line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Extend-Memory-Scale</em> in Summary Area</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With this command you can cycle through the available \*(SA memory scaling which ranges from KiB (kibibytes or 1,024 bytes) through EiB (exbibytes or 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 bytes).</p><p>If you see a `+' between a displayed number and the following label, it means that \*(We was forced to truncate some portion of that number. By raising the scaling factor, such truncation can be avoided.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>e</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Extend-Memory-Scale</em> in Task Windows</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With this command you can cycle through the available \*(TW memory scaling which ranges from KiB (kibibytes or 1,024 bytes) through PiB (pebibytes or 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes).</p><p>While \*(We will try to honor the selected target range, additional scaling might still be necessary in order to accommodate current values. If you wish to see a more homogeneous result in the memory columns, raising the scaling range will usually accomplish that goal. Raising it too high, however, is likely to produce an all zero result which cannot be suppressed with the `0' \*(CI.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>g</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Choose-Another-Window/Field-Group </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You will be prompted to enter a number between 1 and 4 designating the \*(FG which should be made the \*(CW. You will soon grow comfortable with these 4 windows, especially after experimenting with \*(AM.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>H</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Threads-mode</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When this toggle is \*O, individual threads will be displayed for all processes in all visible \*(TWs. Otherwise, \*(We displays a summation of all threads in each process.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Irix/Solaris-Mode</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When operating in Solaris mode (`I' toggled \*F), a task's \*(Pu usage will be divided by the total number of \*(PUs. After issuing this command, you'll be told the new state of this toggle.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>k</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Kill-a-task </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You will be prompted for a PID and then the signal to send.</p><p>Entering no PID or a negative number will be interpreted as the default shown in the prompt (the first task displayed). A PID value of zero means the \*(We program itself.</p><p>The default signal, as reflected in the prompt, is SIGTERM. However, you can send any signal, via number or name.</p><p>If you wish to abort the kill process, do one of the following depending on your progress:</p>
<pre>
    1) at the pid prompt, type an invalid number
    2) at the signal prompt, type 0 (or any invalid signal)
    3) at any prompt, type &lt;Esc&gt;
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>q</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Quit </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>r</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Renice-a-Task </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You will be prompted for a PID and then the value to nice it to.</p><p>Entering no PID or a negative number will be interpreted as the default shown in the prompt (the first task displayed). A PID value of zero means the \*(We program itself.</p><p>A positive nice value will cause a process to lose priority. Conversely, a negative nice value will cause a process to be viewed more favorably by the kernel. As a general rule, ordinary users can only increase the nice value and are prevented from lowering it.</p><p>If you wish to abort the renice process, do one of the following depending on your progress:</p>
<pre>
    1) at the pid prompt, type an invalid number
    2) at the nice prompt, type &lt;Enter&gt; with no input
    3) at any prompt, type &lt;Esc&gt;
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>W</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Write-the-Configuration-File </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This will save all of your options and toggles plus the current display mode and delay time. By issuing this command just before quitting \*(We, you will be able restart later in exactly that same state.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>X</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Extra-Fixed-Width </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Some fields are fixed width and not scalable. As such, they are subject to truncation which would be indicated by a `+' in the last position.</p><p>This \*(CI can be used to alter the widths of the following fields:</p>
<pre>
   <em> field  default    field  default    field  default </em>
    GID       5       GROUP     8       WCHAN    10
    RUID      5       LXC       8       nsIPC    10
    SUID      5       RUSER     8       nsMNT    10
    UID       5       SUSER     8       nsNET    10
                      TTY       8       nsPID    10
                      USER      8       nsUSER   10
                                        nsUTS    10
</pre>
<p>You will be prompted for the amount to be added to the default widths shown above. Entering zero forces a return to those defaults.</p><p>If you enter a negative number, \*(We will automatically increase the column size as needed until there is no more truncated data. You can accelerate this process by reducing the delay interval or holding down the &lt;Space&gt; bar.</p><p>\*(NT Whether explicitly or automatically increased, the widths for these fields are never decreased by \*(We. To narrow them you must specify a smaller number or restore the defaults.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Y</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Inspect-Other-Output </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>After issuing the `Y' \*(CI, you will be prompted for a target PID. Typing a value or accepting the default results in a separate screen. That screen can be used to view a variety of files or piped command output while the normal \*(We iterative display is paused.</p><p>\*(NT This \*(CI is only fully realized when supporting entries have been manually added to the end of the \*(We \*(CF. For details on creating those entries, \*(Xt 6c. ADDING INSPECT Entries.</p><p>Most of the keys used to navigate the Inspect feature are reflected in its header prologue. There are, however, additional keys available once you have selected a particular file or command. They are familiar to anyone who has used the pager `less' and are summarized here for future reference.</p>
<pre>
   <em> key      function </em>
    =        alternate status-line, file or pipeline
    /        find, equivalent to `L' locate
    n        find next, equivalent to `&' locate next
    &lt;Space&gt;  scroll down, equivalent to &lt;PgDn&gt;
    b        scroll up, equivalent to &lt;PgUp&gt;
    g        first line, equivalent to &lt;Home&gt;
    G        last line, equivalent to &lt;End&gt;
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Z</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Change-Color-Mapping </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This key will take you to a separate screen where you can change the colors for the \*(CW, or for all windows. For details regarding this \*(CI \*(Xt 4d. COLOR Mapping.</p><ul>
<li><p>The commands shown with an \*(AK are not available in Secure mode, nor will they be shown on the level-1 help screen.</p></li>
</ul>
  </dd>

<h3>4b. SUMMARY AREA Commands</h3>
<p>The \*(SA \*(CIs are<strong> always available</strong> in both \*(FM and \*(AM. They affect the beginning lines of your display and will determine the position of messages and prompts.</p><p>These commands always impact just the \*(CG. \*(XT 5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provisions and the `g' \*(CI for insight into \*(CWs and \*(FGs.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Show-scroll-coordinates</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Toggle an informational message which is displayed whenever the message line is not otherwise being used. For additional information \*(Xt 5c. SCROLLING a Window.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>l</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Load-Average/Uptime</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is also the line containing the program name (possibly an alias) when operating in \*(FM or the \*(CW name when operating in \*(AM.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>t</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Task/Cpu-States</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This command affects from 2 to many \*(SA lines, depending on the state of the `1', `2' or `3' \*(CTs and whether or not \*(We is running under true SMP.</p><p>This portion of the \*(SA is also influenced by the `H' \*(CI toggle, as reflected in the total label which shows either Tasks or Threads.</p><p>This command serves as a 4-way toggle, cycling through these modes:</p>
<pre>
    1. detailed percentages by category
    2. abbreviated user/system and total % + bar graph
    3. abbreviated user/system and total % + block graph
    4. turn off task and cpu states display
</pre>
<p>When operating in either of the graphic modes, the display becomes much more meaningful when individual CPUs or NUMA nodes are also displayed. \*(XC the `1', `2' and `3' commands below for additional information.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>m</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Memory/Swap-Usage</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This command affects the two \*(SA lines dealing with physical and virtual memory.</p><p>This command serves as a 4-way toggle, cycling through these modes:</p>
<pre>
    1. detailed percentages by memory type
    2. abbreviated % used/total available + bar graph
    3. abbreviated % used/total available + block graph
    4. turn off memory display
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Single/Separate-Cpu-States</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This command affects how the `t' command's Cpu States portion is shown. Although this toggle exists primarily to serve massively-parallel SMP machines, it is not restricted to solely SMP environments.</p><p>When you see `%Cpu(s):' in the \*(SA, the `1' toggle is \*O and all \*(Pu information is gathered in a single line. Otherwise, each \*(Pu is displayed separately as: `%Cpu0, %Cpu1, ...' up to available screen height.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>NUMA-Nodes/Cpu-Summary</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This command toggles between the `1' command cpu summary display (only) or a summary display plus the cpu usage statistics for each NUMA Node. It is only available if a system has the requisite NUMA support.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>3</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Expand-NUMA-Node </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You will be invited to enter a number representing a NUMA Node. Thereafter, a node summary plus the statistics for each cpu in that node will be shown until either the `1' or `2' \*(CT is pressed. This \*(CI is only available if a system has the requisite NUMA support.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>\*(NT If the entire \*(SA has been toggled \*F for any window, you would be left with just the<strong> message line</strong>. In that way, you will have maximized available task rows but (temporarily) sacrificed the program name in \*(FM or the \*(CW name when in \*(AM.</p>
<h3>4c. TASK AREA Commands</h3>
<p>The \*(TA \*(CIs are<strong> always</strong> available in \*(FM.</p><p>The \*(TA \*(CIs are<strong> never available</strong> in \*(AM<em> if</em> the \*(CW's \*(TD has been toggled \*F (\*(Xt 5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provisions).</p><p><strong>APPEARANCE</strong> of \*(TW</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>J</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Justify-Numeric-Columns</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Alternates between right-justified (the default) and left-justified numeric data. If the numeric data completely fills the available column, this \*(CT may impact the column header only.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>j</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Justify-Character-Columns</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>

<p>The following commands will also be influenced by the state of the global `B' (bold enable) toggle.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>b</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Bold/Reverse</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This command will impact how the `x' and `y' toggles are displayed. It may also impact the \*(SA when a bar graph has been selected for \*(Pu states or memory usage via the `t' or `m' toggles.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>x</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Column-Highlight</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Changes highlighting for the current sort field. If you forget which field is being sorted this command can serve as a quick visual reminder, providing the sort field is being displayed. The sort field might<em> not</em> be visible because:</p>
<pre>
    1) there is insufficient<em> Screen Width </em>
    2) the `f' \*(CI turned it \*F
</pre>
<p>\*(NT Whenever Searching and/or Other Filtering is active in a window, column highlighting is temporarily disabled. \*(XC notes at the end of topics 5d. SEARCHING and 5e. FILTERING for an explanation why.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>y</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Row-Highlight</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Changes highlighting for "running" tasks. For additional insight into this task state, \*(Xt 3a.

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>z</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Color/Monochrome</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Switches the \*(CW between your last used color scheme and the older form of black-on-white or white-on-black. This command will alter<strong> both</strong> the \*(SA and \*(TA but does not affect the state of the `x', `y' or `b' toggles.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When Cumulative mode is \*O, each process is listed with the \*(Pu time that it and its dead children have used.</p><p>When \*F, programs that fork into many separate tasks will appear less demanding. For programs like `init' or a shell this is appropriate but for others, like compilers, perhaps not. Experiment with two \*(TWs sharing the same sort field but with different `S' states and see which representation you prefer.</p><p>After issuing this command, you'll be informed of the new state of this toggle.

</pre>
<p>If you use `a' or `w' to cycle the targeted window, you will have applied the color scheme that was displayed when you left that window. You can, of course, easily return to any window and reapply different colors or turn colors \*F completely with the `z' toggle.</p><p>The Color Mapping screen can also be used to change the \*(CG in either \*(FM or \*(AM.

<h3>5a. WINDOWS Overview</h3>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Field Groups/Windows</strong>:</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>In \*(FM there is a single window represented by the entire screen. That single window can still be changed to display 1 of 4 different<strong> field</strong> groups (\*(Xc `g' \*(CI, repeated below). Each of the 4 \*(FGs has a unique separately configurable<strong> \*(SA </strong> and its own configurable<strong> \*(TA</strong>.</p><p>In \*(AM, those 4 underlying \*(FGs can now be made visible simultaneously, or can be turned \*F individually at your command.</p><p>The \*(SA will always exist, even if it's only the message line. At any given time only<em> one</em> \*(SA can be displayed. However, depending on your commands, there could be from<em> zero </em> to<em> four</em> separate \*(TDs currently showing on the screen.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Current Window</strong>:</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The \*(CW is the window associated with the \*(SA and the window to which task related commands are always directed. Since in \*(AM you can toggle the \*(TD \*F, some commands might be restricted for the \*(CW.</p><p>A further complication arises when you have toggled the first \*(SA line \*F. With the loss of the window name (the `l' toggled line), you'll not easily know what window is the \*(CW.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>5b. COMMANDS for Windows</h3>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>-</strong> | <strong>_</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Show/Hide-Window(s)</em> toggles </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The `-' key turns the \*(CW's \*(TD \*O and \*F. When \*O, that \*(TA will show a minimum of the columns header you've established with the `f' \*(CI. It will also reflect any other \*(TA options/toggles you've applied yielding zero or more tasks.</p><p>The `_' key does the same for all \*(TDs. In other words, it switches between the currently visible \*(TD(s) and any \*(TD(s) you had toggled \*F. If all 4 \*(TDs are currently visible, this \*(CI will leave the \*(SA as the only display element.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>=</strong> | <strong>+</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Equalize-(reinitialize)-Window(s) </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The `=' key forces the \*(CW's \*(TD to be visible. It also reverses any `i' (idle tasks), `n' (max tasks), `u/U' (user filter), &#96;o/O' (other filter) and 'L' (locate) commands that might be active. Also, if the window had been scrolled, it will be reset with this command. \*(XT 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information regarding vertical and horizontal scrolling.</p><p>The `+' key does the same for all windows. The four \*(TDs will reappear, evenly balanced.

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Alternate-Display-Mode</em> toggle </p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This will change the \*(CW, which in turn changes the window to which commands are directed. These keys act in a circular fashion so you can reach any desired window using either key.</p><p>Assuming the window name is visible (you have not toggled `l' \*F), whenever the \*(CW name loses its emphasis/color, that's a reminder the \*(TD is \*F and many commands will be restricted.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>g</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Choose-Another-Window/Field-Group </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You will be prompted to enter a number between 1 and 4 designating the \*(FG which should be made the \*(CW.</p><p>In \*(FM, this command is necessary to alter the \*(CW. In \*(AM, it is simply a less convenient alternative to the `a' and `w' commands.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>G</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Change-Window/Field-Group-Name </em></p>
  </dt>

<h3>5c. SCROLLING a Window</h3>
<p>Typically a \*(TW is a partial view into a systems's total tasks/threads which shows only some of the available fields/columns. With these \*(KSs, you can move that view vertically or horizontally to reveal any desired task or column.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Up</strong>,<strong>PgUp</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Scroll-Tasks </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Move the view up toward the first task row, until the first task is displayed at the top of the \*(CW. The <em>Up</em> \*(KA moves a single line while <em>PgUp</em> scrolls the entire window.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Down</strong>,<strong>PgDn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Scroll-Tasks </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Move the view down toward the last task row, until the last task is the only task displayed at the top of the \*(CW. The <em>Down</em> \*(KA moves a single line while <em>PgDn</em> scrolls the entire window.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Left</strong>,<strong>Right</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Scroll-Columns </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Move the view of displayable fields horizontally one column at a time.</p><p>\*(NT As a reminder, some fields/columns are not fixed-width but allocated all remaining screen width when visible. When scrolling right or left, that feature may produce some unexpected results initially.</p><p>Additionally, there are special provisions for any variable width field when positioned as the last displayed field. Once that field is reached via the right arrow key, and is thus the only column shown, you can continue scrolling horizontally within such a field. \*(XC `C' \*(CI below for additional information.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>End</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Jump-to-End-Position </em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Reposition the display so that the rightmost column reflects the last displayable field and the bottom task row represents the last task.</p><p>\*(NT From this position it is still possible to scroll<em> down</em> and<em> right</em> using the \*(KAs. This is true until a single column and a single task is left as the only display element.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>C</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Show-scroll-coordinates</em> toggle </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Toggle an informational message which is displayed whenever the message line is not otherwise being used. That message will take one of two forms depending on whether or not a variable width column has also been scrolled.</p>
<pre>
  <strong>scroll coordinates: y = n/n (tasks), x = n/n (fields)</strong>
  scroll coordinates: y = n/n (tasks), x = n/n (fields)<strong> + nn</strong>
</pre>
<p>The coordinates shown as <strong>n</strong>/<strong>n</strong> are relative to the upper left corner of the \*(CW. The additional `<strong>+&nbsp;nn</strong>' represents the displacement into a variable width column when it has been scrolled horizontally. Such displacement occurs in normal 8 character tab stop amounts via the right and left arrow keys.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>y = n/n (tasks) </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The first <strong>n</strong> represents the topmost visible task and is controlled by \*(KSs. The second <strong>n</strong> is updated automatically to reflect total tasks.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>x = n/n (fields) </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The first <strong>n</strong> represents the leftmost displayed column and is controlled by \*(KSs. The second <strong>n</strong> is the total number of displayable fields and is established with the `<strong>f</strong>' \*(CI.</p><p>The above \*(CIs are<strong> always</strong> available in \*(FM but<strong> never</strong> available in \*(AM if the \*(CW's \*(TD has been toggled \*F.</p><p>\*(NT When any form of filtering is active, you can expect some slight aberrations when scrolling since not all tasks will be visible. This is particularly apparent when using the Up/Down \*(KAs.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>5d. SEARCHING in a Window</h3>
<p>You can use these \*(CIs to locate a task row containing a particular value.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>L</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Locate-a-string</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You will be prompted for the case-sensitive string to locate starting from the current window coordinates. There are no restrictions on search string content.</p><p>Searches are not limited to values from a single field or column. All of the values displayed in a task row are allowed in a search string. You may include spaces, numbers, symbols and even forest view artwork.</p><p>Keying &lt;Enter&gt; with no input will effectively disable the `&' key until a new search string is entered.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>&</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;:<em>Locate-next</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Assuming a search string has been established, \*(We will attempt to locate the next occurrence.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>When a match is found, the current window is repositioned vertically so the task row containing that string is first. The scroll coordinates message can provide confirmation of such vertical repositioning (\*(Xc `C' \*(CI). Horizontal scrolling, however, is never altered via searching.</p><p>The availability of a matching string will be influenced by the following factors.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>for example PID is good but %CPU bad.</p><p>If a search fails, restoring the \*(CW home (unscrolled) position, scrolling horizontally, displaying command-lines or choosing a more stable sort field could yet produce a successful `&' search.</p><p>The above \*(CIs are<strong> always</strong> available in \*(FM but<strong> never</strong> available in \*(AM if the \*(CW's \*(TD has been toggled \*F.</p><p>\*(NT Whenever a Search is active in a window, \*(We will turn column highlighting \*F to prevent false matches on internal non-display escape sequences. Such highlighting will be restored when a window's search string is empty. \*(XC `x' \*(CI for additional information on sort column highlighting.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>5e. FILTERING in a Window</h3>
<p>You can use this Other Filter feature to establish selection criteria which will then determine which tasks are shown in the \*(CW.</p><p>Establishing a filter requires: 1) a field name; 2) an operator; and 3) a selection value, as a minimum. This is the most complex of \*(We's user input requirements so, when you make a mistake, command recall will be your friend. Remember the Up/Down \*(KAs or their aliases when prompted for input.</p><p><strong>Filter Basics</strong></p>

  </dd>

</dl>
<p><strong>Input Requirements</strong></p><p>When prompted for selection criteria, the data you provide must take one of two forms. There are 3 required pieces of information, with a 4th as optional. These examples use spaces for clarity but your input generally would not.</p>
<pre>
        #1           <strong>#2</strong>  #3              ( required )
        Field-Name   ?   include-if-value
     <strong>!</strong>  Field-Name   ?   <strong>exclude</strong>-if-value
     #4                                  ( optional )
</pre>
<p>Items #1, #3 and #4 should be self-explanatory. Item <strong>#2</strong> represents both a required <em>delimiter</em> and the <em>operator</em> which must be one of either equality (`=') or relation (`&lt;' or `&gt;').</p><p>The `=' equality operator requires only a partial match and that can reduce your `if-value' input requirements. The `&gt;' or `&lt;' relational operators always employ string comparisons, even with numeric fields. They are designed to work with a field's default <em>justification</em> and with homogeneous data. When some field's numeric amounts have been subjected to <em>scaling</em> while others have not, that data is no longer homogeneous.</p><p>If you establish a relational filter and you <strong>have</strong> changed the default Numeric or Character <em>justification</em>, that filter is likely to fail. When a relational filter is applied to a memory field and you <strong>have not</strong> changed the <em>scaling</em>, it may produce misleading results. This happens, for example, because `100.0m' (MiB) would appear greater than `1.000g' (GiB) when compared as strings.</p><p>If your filtered results appear suspect, simply altering justification or scaling may yet achieve the desired objective. See the `j', `J' and `e' \*(CIs for additional information.</p><p><strong>Potential Problems</strong></p><p>These <strong>GROUP</strong> filters could produce the exact same results or the second one might not display anything at all, just a blank \*(TW.</p>
<pre>
     GROUP=root        ( only the same results when )
     GROUP=ROOT        ( invoked via lower case `o' )
</pre>
<p>Either of these <strong>RES</strong> filters might yield inconsistent and/or misleading results, depending on the current memory scaling factor. Or both filters could produce the exact same results.</p>
<pre>
     RES&gt;9999          ( only the same results when )
     !RES&lt;10000        ( memory scaling is at `KiB' )
</pre>
<p>This <strong>nMin</strong> filter illustrates a problem unique to scalable fields. This particular field can display a maximum of 4 digits, beyond which values are automatically scaled to KiB or above. So while amounts greater than 9999 exist, they will appear as 2.6m, 197k, etc.</p>
<pre>
     nMin&gt;9999         ( always a blank \*(TW )
</pre>
<p><strong>Potential Solutions</strong></p><p>These examples illustrate how Other Filtering can be creatively applied to achieve almost any desired result. Single quotes are sometimes shown to delimit the spaces which are part of a filter or to represent a request for status (^O) accurately. But if you used them with if-values in real life, no matches would be found.</p><p>Assuming field <strong>nTH</strong> is displayed, the first filter will result in only multi-threaded processes being shown. It also reminds us that a trailing space is part of every displayed field. The second filter achieves the exact same results with less typing.</p>
<pre>
     !nTH=` 1 '                ( ' for clarity only )
     nTH&gt;1                     ( same with less i/p )
</pre>
<p>With Forest View mode active and the <strong>COMMAND</strong> column in view, this filter effectively collapses child processes so that just 3 levels are shown.</p>
<pre>
     !COMMAND=`       `- '     ( ' for clarity only )
</pre>
<p>The final two filters appear as in response to the status request key (^O). In reality, each filter would have required separate input. The <strong>PR</strong> example shows the two concurrent filters necessary to display tasks with priorities of 20 or more, since some might be negative. Then by exploiting trailing spaces, the <strong>nMin</strong> series of filters could achieve the failed `9999' objective discussed above.</p>
<pre>
     `PR&gt;20' + `!PR=-'         ( 2 for right result )
     `!nMin=0 ' + `!nMin=1 ' + `!nMin=2 ' + `!nMin=3 ' ...
</pre>
<p>\*(NT Whenever Other Filtering is active in a window, \*(We will turn column highlighting \*F to prevent false matches on internal non-display escape sequences. Such highlighting will be restored when a window is no longer subject to filtering. \*(XC `x' \*(CI for additional information on sort column highlighting.</p>

<p>The presence of this file will influence which version of the help screen is shown to an ordinary user. More importantly, it will limit what ordinary users are allowed to do when \*(We is running. They will not be able to issue the following commands.</p>
<pre>
    k        Kill a task
    r        Renice a task
    d or s   Change delay/sleep interval
</pre>
<p>The system \*(CF is<strong> not</strong> created by \*(We. Rather, you create this file manually and place it in the <em>/etc </em> directory. Its name must be `toprc' and must have no leading `.' (period). It must have only two lines.</p><p>Here is an example of the contents of<em> /etc/toprc</em>:</p>
<pre>
    s        # line 1: secure mode switch
    5.0      # line 2: delay interval in seconds
</pre>

<h3>6b. PERSONAL Configuration File</h3>
<p>This file is written as `$HOME/.your-name-4-\*(We' + `rc'. Use the `W' \*(CI to create it or update it.</p><p>Here is the general layout:</p>
<pre>
    global   # line  1: the program name/alias notation
      "      # line  2: id,altscr,irixps,delay,curwin
    per ea   # line  a: winname,fieldscur
    window   # line  b: winflags,sortindx,maxtasks,graph modes
      "      # line  c: summclr,msgsclr,headclr,taskclr
    global   # line 15: additional miscellaneous settings
      "      # any remaining lines are devoted to the
      "      # generalized inspect provisions
      "      # discussed below
</pre>
<p>If the $HOME variable is not present, \*(We will try to write the personal \*(CF to the current directory, subject to permissions.</p>
<h3>6c. ADDING INSPECT Entries</h3>
<p>To exploit the `Y' \*(CI, you must add entries at the<strong> end</strong> of the \*(We personal \*(CF. Such entries simply reflect a file to be read or command/pipeline to be executed whose results will then be displayed in a separate scrollable, searchable window.</p><p>If you don't know the location or name of your \*(We rcfile, use the `W' \*(CI to rewrite it and note those details.</p><p>Inspect entries can be added with a redirected echo or by editing the \*(CF. Redirecting an echo risks overwriting the rcfile should it replace (&gt;) rather than append (&gt;&gt;) to that file. Conversely, when using an editor care must be taken not to corrupt existing lines, some of which will contain unprintable data or unusual characters.</p><p>Those Inspect entries beginning with a `#' character are ignored, regardless of content. Otherwise they consist of the following 3 elements, each of which<em> must</em> be separated by a tab character (thus 2 `&#92;t' total):</p>
<pre>
  .type:  literal `file' or `pipe'
  .name:  selection shown on the Inspect screen
  .fmts:  string representing a path or command
</pre>
<p>The two types of Inspect entries are<em> not</em> interchangeable. Those designated `<strong>file</strong>' will be accessed using fopen and must reference a single file in the `.fmts' element. Entries specifying `<strong>pipe</strong>' will employ popen, their `.fmts' element could contain many pipelined commands and, none can be interactive.</p><p>If the file or pipeline represented in your `.fmts' deals with the specific PID input or accepted when prompted, then the format string must also contain the `<strong>%d</strong>' specifier, as these examples illustrate.</p>
<pre>
  .fmts=  /proc/<em>%d</em>/numa_maps
  .fmts=  lsof -P -p<em> %d</em>
</pre>
<p>For `<strong>pipe</strong>' type entries only, you may also wish to redirect stderr to stdout for a more comprehensive result. Thus the format string becomes:</p>
<pre>
  .fmts=  pmap -x %d<em> 2&gt;&1</em>
</pre>
<p>Here are examples of both types of Inspect entries as they might appear in the rcfile. The first entry will be ignored due to the initial `#' character. For clarity, the pseudo tab depictions (^I) are surrounded by an extra space but the actual tabs would not be.</p>
<pre>

  # pipe ^I Sockets ^I lsof -n -P -i 2&gt;&1
  pipe ^I Open Files ^I lsof -P -p %d 2&gt;&1
  file ^I NUMA Info ^I /proc/%d/numa_maps
  pipe ^I Log ^I tail -n100 /var/log/syslog | sort -Mr
</pre>
<p>Except for the commented entry above, these next examples show what could be echoed to achieve similar results, assuming the rcfile name was `.toprc'. However, due to the embedded tab characters, each of these lines should be preceded by `<strong>/bin/echo -e</strong>', not just a simple an `echo', to enable backslash interpretation regardless of which shell you use.</p>
<pre>
  "pipe&#92;tOpen Files&#92;tlsof -P -p %d 2&gt;&1" &gt;&gt; ~/.toprc
  "file&#92;tNUMA Info&#92;t/proc/%d/numa_maps" &gt;&gt; ~/.toprc
  "pipe&#92;tLog&#92;ttail -n200 /var/log/syslog | sort -Mr" &gt;&gt; ~/.toprc
</pre>
<p><strong>Caution</strong>: If any inspect entry you create produces output with unprintable characters they will be displayed in either the ^C notation or hexadecimal &lt;FF&gt; form, depending on their value. This applies to tab characters as well, which will show as `^I'. If you want a truer representation, any embedded tabs should be expanded.</p>
<pre>
  # next would have contained `&#92;t' ...
  # file ^I &lt;your_name&gt; ^I /proc/%d/status
  # but this will eliminate embedded `&#92;t' ...
  pipe ^I &lt;your_name&gt; ^I cat /proc/%d/status | expand -
</pre>
<p>The above example takes what could have been a `file' entry but employs a `pipe' instead so as to expand the embedded tabs.</p><p>\*(NT While `<strong>pipe</strong>' type entries have been discussed in terms of pipelines and commands, there is nothing to prevent you from including <em> shell scripts</em> as well. Perhaps even newly created scripts designed specifically for the `Y' \*(CI.</p><p>Lastly, as the number of your Inspect entries grows over time, the `Options:' row will be truncated when screen width is exceeded. That does not affect operation other than to make some selections invisible.</p><p>However, if some choices are lost to truncation but you want to see more options, there is an easy solution hinted at below.</p>
<pre>
  Inspection Pause at pid ...
  Use:  left/right then &lt;Enter&gt; ...
  Options:  help  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11 ...
</pre>
<p>The entries in the \*(We rcfile would have a number for the `.name' element and the `help' entry would identify a shell script you've written explaining what those numbered selections actually mean. In that way, many more choices can be made visible.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">7. STUPID TRICKS Sampler</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Many of these tricks work best when you give \*(We a scheduling boost. So plan on starting him with a nice value of -10, assuming you've got the authority.</p><h3>7a. Kernel Magic</h3>
<p>For these stupid tricks, \*(We needs \*(FM.</p><ul>
<li><p>The user interface, through prompts and help, intentionally implies that the delay interval is limited to tenths of a second. However, you're free to set any desired delay. If you want to see Linux at his scheduling best, try a delay of .09 seconds or less.</p><p>For this experiment, under x-windows open an xterm and maximize it. Then do the following:</p>
<pre>
  . provide a scheduling boost and tiny delay via:
      nice -n -10 \*(We -d.09
  . keep sorted column highlighting \*F so as to
    minimize path length
  . turn \*O reverse row highlighting for emphasis
  . try various sort columns (TIME/MEM work well),
    and normal or reverse sorts to bring the most
    active processes into view
</pre>
<p>What you'll see is a very busy Linux doing what he's always done for you, but there was no program available to illustrate this.</p></li><li><p>Under an xterm using `white-on-black' colors, on \*(We's Color Mapping screen set the task color to black and be sure that task highlighting is set to bold, not reverse. Then set the delay interval to around .3 seconds.</p><p>After bringing the most active processes into view, what you'll see are the ghostly images of just the currently running tasks.</p></li><li><p>Delete the existing rcfile, or create a new symlink. Start this new version then type `T' (a secret key, \*(Xt 4c. Task Area Commands, SORTING) followed by `W' and `q'. Finally, restart the program with -d0 (zero delay).</p><p>Your display will be refreshed at three times the rate of the former \*(We, a 300% speed advantage. As \*(We climbs the TIME ladder, be as patient as you can while speculating on whether or not \*(We will ever reach the \*(We.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>7b. Bouncing Windows</h3>
<p>For these stupid tricks, \*(We needs \*(AM.</p><ul>
<li><p>With 3 or 4 \*(TDs visible, pick any window other than the last and turn idle processes \*F using the `i' \*(CT. Depending on where you applied `i', sometimes several \*(TDs are bouncing and sometimes it's like an accordion, as \*(We tries his best to allocate space.</p></li><li><p>Set each window's summary lines differently: one with no memory (`m'); another with no states (`t'); maybe one with nothing at all, just the message line. Then hold down `a' or `w' and watch a variation on bouncing windows \*(Em hopping windows.</p></li><li><p>Display all 4 windows and for each, in turn, set idle processes to \*F using the `i' \*(CT. You've just entered the "extreme bounce" zone.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>7c. The Big Bird Window</h3>
<p>This stupid trick also requires \*(AM.</p><ul>
<li><p>Display all 4 windows and make sure that 1:Def is the \*(CW. Then, keep increasing window size with the `n' \*(CI until all the other \*(TDs are "pushed out of the nest".</p><p>When they've all been displaced, toggle between all visible/invisible windows using the `_' \*(CT. Then ponder this:</p>
<pre>
   is \*(We fibbing or telling honestly your imposed truth?
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>7d. The Ol' Switcheroo</h3>
<p>This stupid trick works best without \*(AM, since justification is active on a per window basis.</p><ul>
<li><p>Start \*(We and make COMMAND the last (rightmost) column displayed. If necessary, use the `c' \*(CT to display command lines and ensure that forest view mode is active with the `V' \*(CT.</p><p>Then use the up/down arrow keys to position the display so that some truncated command lines are shown (`+' in last position). You may have to resize your xterm to produce truncation.</p><p>Lastly, use the `j' \*(CT to make the COMMAND column right justified.</p><p>Now use the right arrow key to reach the COMMAND column. Continuing with the right arrow key, watch closely the direction of travel for the command lines being shown.</p>
<pre>
   some lines travel left, while others travel right
</pre>

<pre>
   eventually all lines will Switcheroo, and move right
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
