.SH NAME
ypinit - NIS database install and build program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
/usr/lib/yp/ypinit
[
.B \-m
] [
.B \-s 
.I master_name
] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ypinit
builds the domain subdirectory of /var/yp for the current default
domain. After building the domain subdirectory,
.B ypinit
builds a complete set of administrative maps for your system and places
them in this directory. The first map created by
.B ypinit -m
is the ypservers map. You should run it as root on the hosts, which
should be the master ypserver.
You should have only one master server per NIS domain.
.LP
All databases are built from scratch,
either from information available to the program at runtime,
or from the
.SM ASCII
data base files in
.BR /etc .
These files are listed below under
.SM FILES\s0.
.LP
An
.SM NIS
database on a slave server is set up by copying
an existing database from a running server.  The
.I master_name
argument should be the hostname of an
.SM NIS
server (either the master server for all the maps,
or a server on which the data base is up-to-date and stable).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-m
If the local host is the
.SM NIS
master.
.TP
.B \-s
Set up a slave server with the database from
.I master_name
