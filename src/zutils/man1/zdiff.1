.SH NAME
zdiff \- decompress and compare two files line by line
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zdiff
[\fI\,options\/\fR] \fI\,file1 \/\fR[\fI\,file2\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Zdiff compares two files ("\-" means standard input), and if they
differ, shows the differences line by line. If any given file is
compressed, its decompressed content is used. Zdiff is a front end to
the diff program and has the limitation that messages from diff refer to
temporary filenames instead of those specified.
.PP
The supported formats are bzip2, gzip, lzip and xz.
.PP
Compares <file1> to <file2>. If <file2> is omitted zdiff tries the
following:
.IP
1. If <file1> is compressed, compares its decompressed contents with
the corresponding uncompressed file (the name of <file1> with the
extension removed).
.IP
2. If <file1> is uncompressed, compares it with the decompressed
contents of <file1>.[lz|bz2|gz|xz] (the first one that is found).
.IP
3. If no suitable file is found, compares <file1> with data read from
standard input.
.PP
Exit status is 0 if inputs are identical, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.
