.SH NAME
zcmp \- decompress and compare two files byte by byte
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zcmp
[\fI\,options\/\fR] \fI\,file1 \/\fR[\fI\,file2\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Zcmp compares two files ("\-" means standard input), and if they
differ, tells the first byte and line number where they differ. Bytes
and lines are numbered starting with 1. If any given file is compressed,
its decompressed content is used. Compressed files are decompressed on
the fly; no temporary files are created.
.PP
The supported formats are bzip2, gzip, lzip and xz.
.PP
Compares <file1> to <file2>. If <file2> is omitted zcmp tries the
following:
.IP
1. If <file1> is compressed, compares its decompressed contents with
the corresponding uncompressed file (the name of <file1> with the
extension removed).
.IP
2. If <file1> is uncompressed, compares it with the decompressed
contents of <file1>.[lz|bz2|gz|xz] (the first one that is found).
.IP
3. If no suitable file is found, compares <file1> with data read from
standard input.
.PP
Exit status is 0 if inputs are identical, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.
