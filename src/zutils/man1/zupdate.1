.TH ZUPDATE "1" "August 2014" "zupdate (zutils) 1.3" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
zupdate \- recompress bzip2, gzip, xz files to lzip files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zupdate
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,files\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Zupdate recompresses files from bzip2, gzip, and xz formats to lzip format.
The originals are compared with the new files and then deleted.
Only regular files with standard file name extensions are recompressed,
other files are ignored.
Compressed files are decompressed and then recompressed on the fly; no
temporary files are created.
The lzip format is chosen as destination because it is by far the most
appropriate for long\-term data archiving.
.PP
If the lzip compressed version of a file already exists, the file is
skipped unless the '\-\-force' option is given. In this case, if the
comparison with the existing lzip version fails, an error is returned
and the original file is not deleted. The operation of zupdate is meant
to be safe and not produce any data loss. Therefore, existing lzip
compressed files are never overwritten nor deleted.
.PP
Exit status is 0 if all the compressed files were successfully
recompressed (if needed), compared and deleted (if requested). Non\-zero
otherwise.
