\fBpostfix-add-filter\fR [\fIsmtp service name\fR...] [\fIsmtpd port\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostfix-add-filter\fR(8) command adds an smtp service named
\fIsmtp service name\fR and and smtpd server listening on \fIsmtpd port\fR to
\/etc/postfix/master.cf to facilitate integration of SMTP filters such as
amavisd-new or clamsmtp.  The configuration is based on the upstream
recommendations for amavisd-new 2.6.0.  Adminstrators should verify it is
appropriate for their requirements.

The original file is copied prior to modification and left in /etc/postfix to
make it possible to revert changes easily.

Available in the Debian package for Postfix version 2.5.3 and later.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
If the given \fIsmtp service name\fR or \fIsmtpd port\fR already appear in the
master.cf, a message will be printed to standard out and master.cf will not be
modified.

.IP \fBMAIL_CONFIG\fR
Directory with Postfix configuration files.

The \fBpostfix-add-filter\fR(8) command should use this, but it currently
doesn't.  It is hard coded to /etc/postfix.  This should be changed.
