.SH NAME
uudecode \- decode an encoded file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uudecode
.\" Mixture of short (flag) options and long options
.RB [ \-\fIflag\fP " [\fIvalue\fP]]... [" \-\-\fIopt\-name\fP "[[=| ]\fIvalue\fP]]..." " " "[<file>...]"
.PP
If no \fIfile\fP(s) are provided, then standard input is decoded.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIuudecode\fP transforms uuencoded files into their original form.
.sp
The encoded file(s) may be specified on the command line, or one may
be read from standard input.  The output file name is specified in
the encoded file, but may be overridden with the \fB-o\fP option.
It will have the mode of the original file, except that setuid and
execute bits are not retained.  If the output file is specified to
be \fI/dev/stdout\fP or \fI-\fP, the result will be written to
standard output. If there are multiple input files and the second or
subsquent file specifies standard output, the decoded data will be
written to the same file as the previous output.  Don't do that.
.sp
\fIuudecode\fP ignores any leading and trailing lines.  It looks
for a line that starts with "\fBbegin\fP" and proceeds until the
end-of-encoding marker is found.  The program determines from the
header line of the encoded file which of the two supported encoding
schemes was used and whether or not the output file name has been
encoded with base64 encoding.  See \fIuuencode(5)\fP.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BR  \-o " \fIfile\fP, " \-\-output\-file "=" \fIfile\fP
direct output to \fIfile\fP.
.sp
If specified, decoded data are written to this file.  When multiple
inputs are specified on the command line, this option cannot be
specified.  All decoded data must be written to the file name
encoded in the data.
.TP
.BR  \-c ", " \-\-ignore\-chmod
ignore \fBfchmod(3P)\fP errors.
.sp
By default, if the output file permissions cannot be changed to
the permissions specified in the encoded data, the file will not
be written out and execution stops.  This option will cause that
error to be ignored.  The resulting file will have all the data,
but the incorrect mode settings.
.sp
\fBfchmod()\fP errors are also ignored if
\fBPOSIXLY_CORRECT\fP is set in the environment.  RE:
\fIhttp://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=635\fP
.sp
A warning is always emitted when \fBfchmod()\fP fails.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display usage information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-! , " \-\-more\-help"
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
.TP
.BR \-R " [\fIcfgfile\fP]," " \-\-save\-opts" "[=\fIcfgfile\fP]"
Save the option state to \fIcfgfile\fP.  The default is the \fIlast\fP
configuration file listed in the \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP section, below.
The command will exit after updating the config file.
.TP
.BR \-r " \fIcfgfile\fP," " \-\-load\-opts" "=\fIcfgfile\fP," " \-\-no\-load\-opts"
Load options from \fIcfgfile\fP.
The \fIno\-load\-opts\fP form will disable the loading
of earlier config/rc/ini files.  \fI\-\-no\-load\-opts\fP is handled early,
out of order.
.TP
.BR \-v " [{\fIv|c|n\fP}]," " \-\-version" "[={\fIv|c|n\fP}]"
Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple
version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will
print the full copyright notice.
.sp
.SH "OPTION PRESETS"
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s).
The file "\fI$HOME/.sharrc\fP" will be used, if present.
.SH STANDARDS
This implementation is compliant with P1003.2b/D11.
.SH "FILES"
See \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP for configuration files.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
One of the following exit values will be returned:
.TP
.BR 0 " (EXIT_SUCCESS)"
Successful program execution.
.TP
.BR 1 " (EXIT_OPTION_ERROR)"
The command options were misconfigured.
.TP
.BR 2 " (EXIT_INVALID)"
(warning) One or more input files contained no valid data
.TP
.BR 4 " (EXIT_NO_INPUT)"
(warning) The specified input file was not found
.TP
.BR 8 " (EXIT_NO_OUTPUT)"
The specified output file could not be created (error); or else one of the output files could not be written or its access mode could not be changed (warnings).  The accompanying message(s) will distinguish.
.TP
.BR 9 " (EXIT_NO_MEM)"
No process memory available
.TP
.BR 66 " (EX_NOINPUT)"
A specified configuration file could not be loaded.
.TP
.BR 70 " (EX_SOFTWARE)"
libopts had an internal operational error.  Please report
it to autogen-users@lists.sourceforge.net.  Thank you.
.PP
The exit status codes are (mostly) warning codes.
As such, each code is "or"\-ed into the final exit code as the input
files are processed.  For example, an exit code of '6' is not listed
above.  It is the sum of \fBEXIT_INVALID\fP and \fBEXIT_NO_INPUT\fP.
It would mean that at least one input file contained invalid
data and also at least one input file could not be found at all.

.SH BUGS
Please put \fBsharutils\fP in the subject line for emailed bug
reports.  It helps to spot the message.
.PP
If more than one \fIname\fP in the encoded files are the same, or
if the second or following input files specifies standard output
for the output file, then the result is probably not what is expected.
Specifically, standard output will be appended to and named output
files will be replaced.
