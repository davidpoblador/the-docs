.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP"
show this help message and exit
.IP "\fB\-C, \-\-cache\fP" 
Tells repoquery to run entirely from YUM cache - does not download any metadata
or update the cache. Queries in this mode can fail or give partial/incorrect
results if the cache isn't fully populated beforehand with eg "yum makecache".
.IP "\fB\-c <config file>, \-\-config=<config file>\fP"
Use alternative config file (default is /etc/yum.conf).

.IP "\fB\-\-repoid=<repo>\fP"
Specify which repository to query. Using this option disables all repositories
not explicitly enabled with \-\-repoid option (can be used multiple times). By
default repoquery uses whatever repositories are enabled in YUM configuration.
.IP "\fB\-\-enablerepo=<repo>\fP"
In addition to the default set, query the given additional repository, even if
it is disabled in YUM configuration.  Can be used multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-\-disablerepo=<repo>\fP"
Do not query the given repository, even if it is enabled in YUM
configuration.  Can be used multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-\-repofrompath=<repoid>,<path/url>\fP"
Specify a path or url to a repository (same path as in a baseurl) to add to
the repositories for this query. This option can be used multiple times. If
you want to view only the pkgs from this repository combine this with
\-\-repoid. The repoid for the repository is specified by <repoid>.

.IP "\fB\-\-old\-packages=<pkg>\fP"
Explicitly list the valid old packages to match the new packages against.
.IP "\fB\-\-ignore\-arch\fP"
Ignore arch. so you can compare foo-2.i686 to foo-1.x86_64.
.IP "\fB\-\-skip\-new\fP"
Only give output for packages which we've found an old package for.
