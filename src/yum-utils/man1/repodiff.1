.SH "NAME"
repodiff \- list differences between two or more Yum repositories
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBrepodiff\fP \-\-old=old_repo_baseurl \-\-new=new_repo_baseurl
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fBrepodiff\fP is a program which will list differences between two sets of 
repositories.  \fBNote\fP that by default only source packages are compared.
.PP 
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-\-old, \-o\fP"
Add a repo. as an old repo. Note that if you prefix the url with "mirror:" then
the following url is treated as a mirror and not a baseurl.
.IP "\fB\-\-new, \-n\fP"
Add a repo. as an new repo. Note that if you prefix the url with "mirror:" then
the following url is treated as a mirror and not a baseurl.
.IP "\fB\-\-archlist, \-a\fP"
Add architectures to change the default from just comparing source packages.
Note that if you want the same as a native
"x86_64" architecture machine you just need to pass "x86_64" (this is different
from earlier versions where you needed to specify
"x86_64,athlon,i686,i586,i486,i386,noarch" and you still got "src").
.IP "\fB\-\-size, \-s\fP"
Output additional data about the size of the changes.
.IP "\fB\-\-compare\-arch\fP"
Normally packages are just compared based on their name, this flag makes the
comparison also use the arch. So foo.i386 and foo.x86_64 are different.
.IP "\fB\-\-simple\fP"
Output a simple one line message for modified packages.
.IP "\fB\-\-downgrade\fP"
Split the data for modified packages between upgraded and downgraded packages.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IP "Compare source pkgs in two local repos:"
\fBrepodiff \-\-old=/tmp/repo-old \-\-new=/tmp/repo-new\fP
.IP "Compare x86_64 compat. binary pkgs in two remote repos, and two local one:"
\fBrepodiff \-a x86_64 \-\-old=http://example.com/repo1-old \-\-old=/tmp/repo-old \-\-new=http://example.com/repo1-new \-\-new=/tmp/repo-new\fP
.IP "Compare x86_64 compat. binary pkgs, but also compare arch:"
\fBrepodiff \-a x86_64 \-\-compare\-arch \-\-old=http://example.com/repo1-old \-\-old=/tmp/repo-old \-\-new=http://example.com/repo1-new \-\-new=/tmp/repo-new\fP
.IP "Compare two releases of Fedora (15 => 16):"
\fBrepodiff \-\-old='mirror:https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=fedora-source-15&arch=i386' \-\-new='mirror:https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=fedora-source-16&arch=i386' \-\-size \-\-simple \-\-downgrade\fP
