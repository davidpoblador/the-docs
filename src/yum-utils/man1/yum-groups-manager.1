yum repository. This is often much easier than writing/editing the XML by hand.

.SH "BUGS"
.nf
There are a couple of options you can't set, yet. Most notably you cannot put
package names into the conditional section (where they are installed with
groupinstall only if another package is installed).

Other than that, there are no bugs, but should you find any, you should first
consult the FAQ section on http://yum.baseurl.org/wiki/Faq and if unsuccessful
in finding a resolution contact the mailing list: yum-devel@lists.baseurl.org.
To file a bug use http://bugzilla.redhat.com for Fedora/RHEL/Centos
related bugs and http://yum.baseurl.org/report for all other bugs.
