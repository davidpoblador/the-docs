\fBrepoquery\fP \-a [options]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fBrepoquery\fP is a program for querying information from YUM repositories
similarly to rpm queries.
.PP 
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-\-querytags\fP"
List valid queryformat tags and exit.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fP"
Report program version and exit.
.IP "\fB\-\-repoid=<repo>\fP"
Specify which repository to query. Using this option disables all repositories
not explicitly enabled with \-\-repoid option (can be used multiple times). By
default repoquery uses whatever repositories are enabled in YUM configuration.
.IP "\fB\-\-enablerepo=<repo>\fP"
In addition to the default set, query the given additional repository, even if
it is disabled in YUM configuration.  Can be used multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-\-disablerepo=<repo>\fP"
Do not query the given repository, even if it is enabled in YUM
configuration.  Can be used multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-\-repofrompath=<repoid>,<path/url>\fP"
Specify a path or url to a repository (same path as in a baseurl) to add to
the repositories for this query. This option can be used multiple times. If
you want to view only the pkgs from this repository combine this with
\-\-repoid. The repoid for the repository is specified by <repoid>.
.IP "\fB\-\-plugins\fP"
Enable YUM plugin support.
.IP "\fB\-q, \-\-query\fP"
For rpmquery compatibility, doesn't do anything.
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP"
Help; display a help message and then quit\&.
.IP "\fB\-\-quiet\fP" 
Run quietly: no warnings printed to stderr.
.IP "\fB\-\-verbose\fP"
Produce verbose output.
.IP "\fB\-C, \-\-cache\fP" 
Tells repoquery to run entirely from YUM cache - does not download any metadata
or update the cache. Queries in this mode can fail or give partial/incorrect
results if the cache isn't fully populated beforehand with eg "yum makecache".
.IP "\fB\-\-nolock\fP"
Disable locking the yum cache. This is needed as any yum API caller can alter
the repo. metadata cache, unless it is locked. This automatically enables the
--cache and --tempcache options, to try to lower the riskiness.
.IP "\fB\-\-tempcache\fP"
Create and use a private cache instead of the main YUM cache. This is used
by default when run as non-root user.
.IP "\fB\-c <config file>, \-\-config=<config file>\fP"
Use alternative config file (default is /etc/yum.conf).
.IP "\fB\-\-releasever=version\fP"
Pretend the current release version is the given string. This is very useful
when combined with \-\-installroot. You can also use \-\-releasever=/ to take
the releasever information from outside the installroot.
Note that with the default upstream cachedir, of /var/cache/yum, using this
option will corrupt your cache (and you can use $releasever in your cachedir
configuration to stop this).
.IP "\fB\-\-installroot=root\fP"
Specifies an alternative installroot, relative to which all packages will be
installed. Think of this like doing "chroot <root> yum" except using
\-\-installroot allows yum to work before the chroot is created.
Note: You may also want to use the option \-\-releasever=/ when creating the
installroot as otherwise the $releasever value is taken from the rpmdb within
the installroot (and thus. will be empty, before creation).
.IP "\fB\-\-setopt=option=value\fP"
Set any config option in yum config or repo files. For options in the global 
config just use: \-\-setopt=option=value for repo options use: \-\-setopt=repoid.option=value

.IP "\fB\-\-groupmember PACKAGE\fP"
List the repodata groups (yumgroups.xml) belongs to (if any).
.IP "\fB\-\-nvr\fP"
Use name-version-release output format (rpm query default)
.IP "\fB\-\-nevra\fP"
Use name-epoch:version-release.architecture output format (default)
.IP "\fB\-\-envra\fP"
Use epoch:name-version-release.architecture output format 
(easier to parse than nevra)
.IP "\fB\-\-qf=FORMAT, \-\-queryformat=FORMAT\fP"
Specify custom output format for queries. You can add ":date", ":day" and
":isodate" to all the tags that are a time, and you can add ":k", ":m", ":g",
":t" and ":h" to sizes. You can also specify field width as in
sprintf (Eg. %-20{name})
.IP "\fB\-\-output [text|ascii-tree|ascii-tree+|dot-tree|dot-tree+]\fP"
Output format which can be used with \-\-requires/\-\-weak-requires/\-\-whatrequires/\-\-obsoletes/\-\-conflicts. The variants with a + suffix are used for weak dependencies and will merge the stronger variants into the output.
Default output is 'text'.
.IP "\fB\-\-level [all|any int]\fP"
In combination with \-\-output ascii-tree|dot-tree|ascii-tree+|dot-tree+ this
option specifies the number of level to print on the tree.
 Default level is 'all'.

.SH "PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS" 
.IP "\fB\-a, \-\-all\fP"
Query all available packages (for rpmquery compatibility / shorthand for 
repoquery '*')
.IP "\fB\--show-duplicates\fP"
Query all versions of packages.
.IP "\fB\-f, \-\-file FILE\fP"
Query package owning FILE.
.IP "\fB\-\-whatobsoletes CAPABILITY\fP"

.IP "\fB\-\-whatrequires CAPABILITY\fP"
Query all packages that require CAPABILITY.
.IP "\fB\-\-alldeps\fP"
When used with \-\-whatrequires, look for non-explicit dependencies in
addition to explicit ones (e.g. files and Provides in addition to
package names).  This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-\-exactdeps\fP"
When used with \-\-whatrequires, search for dependencies only exactly as given.
This is effectively the opposite of \-\-alldeps.
.IP "\fB\-\-recursive\fP"
When used with \-\-whatrequires, and \-\-requires \-\-resolve, query packages
recursively.
.IP "\fB\-\-archlist=ARCH1[,ARCH2...]\fP"
Limit the query to packages of given architecture(s). Valid values are all
architectures known to rpm/yum such as 'i386' and 'src' for
source RPMS. Note that repoquery will now change yum's "arch" to the first
value in the archlist. So "\-\-archlist=i386,i686" will change yum's canonical
arch to i386, but allow packages of i386 and i686.
.IP "\fB\-\-pkgnarrow=WHAT\fP"
Limit what packages are considered for the query. Valid values for WHAT are:
installed, available, recent, updates, extras, all and repository (default).
.IP "\fB\-\-installed\fP"
Restrict query ONLY to installed pkgs - disables all repos and only acts on rpmdb.

.PP
.SH "GROUP QUERY OPTIONS"

.SH "GROUP SELECTION OPTIONS" 
.PP
.IP "\fB\-a\fP"

.PP 
.SH "FILES"
As repoquery uses YUM libraries for retrieving all the information, it
relies on YUM configuration for its default values like which repositories
to use. Consult YUM documentation for details:
