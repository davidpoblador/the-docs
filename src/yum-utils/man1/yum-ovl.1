.
.SH "NAME"
yum\-ovl \- Performs an initial copy\-up of yum(8) package database\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
\fB\-d\fR \fIdebug\-level\fR If debug level is \fI2\fR and more, print out the number of files copied up from the lower layer
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Opening a file on OverlayFS in read\-only mode causes the file from
.br
lower layer to be opened, then later on, if the same file is opened 
.br
in write mode, a copy-up into the upper    layer    takes    place, 
.br
resulting into a \fBnew\fR file being opened\.
.br
Since yum(8) needs to open the \fBRPMdb\fR first read-only, and then
.br
also with write access, we need to copy-up the files beforehand to 
.br
make sure that the access is consistent.

.SH "FILES"

\fI/etc/yum/pluginconf\.d/ovl\.conf\fR Configuration file allowing to enable/disable the plugin
