.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pmerr
.I code
\&...
.br
.B pmerr
\f3\-l\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmerr
accepts
standard Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
error codes via the
.I code
argument(s) and generates the corresponding error text.
.PP
Each
.I code
may be an integer, a hexadecimal value or a hexadecimal value prefixed
by either ``0x'' or ``0X''.
.PP
Error codes must be less than zero, so if
.I code
is a positive number, a warning message is produced, and the
negated value is used.
.PP
The alternative use of the
.B \-l
option causes all known error codes to be listed, along with their
symbolic names and error text.
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR PMAPI (3),
.BR pmErrStr (3),
.BR pcp.conf (5)
and
.BR pcp.env (5).
