.TH PMDAKVM 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdakvm\f1 \- Linux virtualization performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdakvm\f1 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (\s-1PMDA\s0) which
exports metric values from the Linux KVM virtualisation subsystem.
.PP
Unlike many PMDAs it dynamically enumerates its metric hierarchy,
based entirely on the contents of /sys/kernel/debug/kvm.
.SH INSTALLATION
Install the kvm PMDA by using the Install script as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/kvm
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/kvm
.br
      # ./Remove
.PP
\fBpmdakvm\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed 
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the 
agent is installed or removed.

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables. 
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative 
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
