.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmdiff
compares the average values for every metric in either one
or two sets of archives, in a given time window, for changes that are
likely to be of interest when searching for performance regressions.
.PP
The archive specifiers
.I archive1
and
.I archive2
may be comma-separated lists of names, each of which may be the base name of
an archive or the name of a directory containing one or more archives. Each
archive in the resulting set of archives must have been previously created using
.BR pmlogger (1).
The
.BR pmlogsummary (1)
utility is used to obtain the average values used for comparison.
.PP
There are two sorts of invocation of the tool: with either one or
two sets of archives.
.PP
In the first case, the only sensible command line requires use of
all four time window arguments.  These are specified using the same
time window format described in
.BR PCPIntro (1),
and are
.BR \-S / \-\-start
and
.BR \-T / \-\-finish
for the start and end times of the first time window of interest
in the archive set, and
.BR \-B / \-\-before
and
.BR \-E / \-\-end
for the start and end times of the second time window of interest.
.PP
In the second case, with two sets of archives, the 
.BR \-B / \-\-before
and
.BR \-E / \-\-end
options might be unnecessary.  This might be the case, for example,
when comparing the same time window of two consecutive days (usually
two separate sets of archives), or a time window on the same day of different
weeks.
.PP
In either case,
.B pmdiff
produces a sorted summary of those metrics in the specified window
whose values have deviated the most from a minimal threshold.
The level of deviation is calculated by dividing the average value
of each metric in both logs, and then calculating whether the ratio
falls outside of a range considered normal.
This ratio can be adjusted using the
.BR \-q / \-\-threshold
option, and by default it is 2 (i.e. report all metrics with average
values that have more than doubled in the two time windows or more
than halved in the two time windows).
.PP
If the baseline value is zero and the comparison value is non-zero,
the ratio is reported as ``|+|'' (infinitely large).
If the comparison value is zero and the baseline value is non-zero,
the ratio is reported as ``|-|'' (infinitely small).
.PP
Reported metrics are sorted in ascending ratio order.
.PP
Should any metrics be present in one window but missing from the
other, a diagnostic will be displayed listing each missing metric
and the archive set from which it was missing.
.PP
The remaining options control the specific information to be reported.
Metrics with counter semantics are converted to rates before being
evaluated.
.TP 5
.BR \-p / \-\-precision
Print all floating point numbers with 
.I precision
digits after the decimal place.
.TP
.B \-\-skip-excluded
Cull the list of names of metrics being excluded from the output.
.TP
.B \-\-skip-missing
By default,
.B pmdiff
will report the names of any metrics that are in one archive set but not
the other.
This option suppresses that reporting.
.TP
.B \-x
Compare each metric in each archive set in the time windows specified
to a given
.BR egrep (1)
pattern, excluding those that match from the report output.
.TP
.B \-X
Allows a
.IR file
to be specified which containing
.BR egrep (1)
patterns which are applied to the metric names to optionally exclude
some from the report.
.TP
.B \-z
Use the local timezone from the given archive set.
.TP
.BR \-Z / \-\-timezone
Changes the timezone in the archive labels to
.I timezone
in the format of the environment variable
.B TZ
as described in
.BR environ (7).
.PP
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 10
.BI $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/ hostname
Default directory for PCP archives containing performance
metric values collected from the host
.IR hostname .
.PD
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
