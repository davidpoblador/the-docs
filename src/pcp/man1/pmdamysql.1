.TH PMDAMYSQL 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdamysql\f1 \- MySQL database PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdamysql\f1 is a Performance Co-Pilot \s-1PMDA\s0 which extracts
live performance data from a running MySQL database.
.SH INSTALLATION
\f3pmdamysql\f1 uses a configuration file from (in this order):
.IP "\(bu" 4
/etc/pcpdbi.conf
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fR/mysql/mysql.conf
.PP
This file can contain overridden values (Perl code) for the settings
listed at the start of pmdamysql.pl, namely:
.IP "\(bu" 4
database name (see \s-1\fIDBI\s0\fR\|(3) for details)
.IP "\(bu" 4
database username
.PP
Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
mysql performance metrics by doing the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mysql
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mysql
.br
      # ./Remove
.PP
\fBpmdamysql\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed 
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the 
agent is installed or removed.
.SH "Binary Status values in text"
Some of the status values are in the form of \s-1YES/NO\s0 or \s-1ON/OFF\s0.
.PP
Since these cannot be interpreted by tools like
.BR pmie (1), 
they have been duplicated with a _num extension
and the values of 1 (\s-1YES/ON\s0) or 0 (\s-1NO/OFF\s0).

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables. 
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative 
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
