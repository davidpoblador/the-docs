.SH DESCRIPTION
The components of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) use
a global vector of bit-fields
to control diagnostic and debug output.
.PP
.B pmdbg
with a
.B \-l
argument prints out the mnemonic and decimal values of all
the bit-fields in the debug control vector.
.PP
.B pmdbg
with a
.B \-D
argument parses the list of
\fInames\fP(s) using
.BR __pmParseDebug (3)
and reports the corresponding decimal value.  This is most useful
when debugging and wanting to set the internal value of the
control vector (\c
.BR pmDebug )
via a debugger, e.g.
.BR gdb (1).
.PP
In the alternative usage, the
.I code
arguments are values for the debug vector, and the bit-fields that
are enabled by each of these values is listed.
.PP
Each
.I code
may be an integer, a hexadecimal value or a hexadecimal value prefixed
by either ``0x'' or ``0X''.
.PP
Most applications using the facilities of the PCP support
a
.BI \-D N
command-line syntax to enable debug control.
.B pmdbg
is designed to help choose an appropriate value for
.IR N .
.PP
Alternatively the initial value of the debug control flags may be set
to a value
.I N
using the environment variable
.BR $PCP_DEBUG .
If both mechanisms are used the effect is additive, so the resultant flags are
those set via
.B $PCP_DEBUG
combined with those set via any
.B \-D
command line options.
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).

.BR PCPIntro (1),
.BR pcp.conf (5)
and
.BR pcp.env (5).
