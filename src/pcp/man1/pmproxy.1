.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmproxy
acts as a protocol proxy for
.BR pmcd (1),
allowing Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) monitoring clients to connect to
one or more
.BR pmcd (1)
instances via
.BR pmproxy .
.PP
Normally
.B pmproxy
is deployed in a firewall domain, or on a ``head'' node of a cluster
where the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the hosts where
.BR pmcd (1)
is running may be unknown to the PCP monitoring clients, although the
IP address of the host where
.B pmproxy
is running is known to these clients.
Similarly, the clients may have network connectivity only to the
host where
.B pmproxy
is running, while there is network connectivity from that host to the
hosts of interest where
.BR pmcd (1)
is running.
.PP
The behaviour of the PCP monitoring clients is controlled by either the
.B PMPROXY_HOST
environment variable or through the extended hostname specification
(see
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for details).
If neither of these mechanisms is used, clients will make their
connections directly to
.BR pmcd (1).
If the proxy hostname syntax is used or
.B PMPROXY_HOST
is set, then this should be the hostname or IP address of the system
where
.B pmproxy
is running, and the clients will connect to
.BR pmcd (1)
indirectly through the protocol proxy services of
.BR pmproxy.
.PP
The options to
.B pmproxy
are as follows.
.TP
.B \-A
Disable service advertisement.
By default,
.B pmproxy
will advertise its presence on the network using any available mechanisms
(such as Avahi/DNS-SD), assisting remote monitoring tools with finding it.
These mechanisms are disabled with this option.
.TP
\f3\-C\f1 \f2dirname\f1
Specify the path to the Network Security Services certificate database,
for (optional) secure connections.
The default is
.BR /etc/pki/nssdb .
Refer also to the \f3\-P\f1 option.
If it does not already exist, this database can be created using the
.B certutil
utility.
This process and other certificate database maintenance information
is provided in the
.BR PCPIntro (1)
manual page and the online PCP tutorials.
.TP
.B \-f
By default
.B pmproxy
is started as a daemon.
The
.B \-f
option indicates that it should run in the foreground.
This is most useful when trying to diagnose problems with establishing
connections.
.TP
\f3\-i\f1 \f2ipaddress\f1
This option is usually only used on hosts with more than one network
interface (very common for firewall and ``head'' node hosts where
.B pmproxy
is most likely to be deployed).  If no
.B \-i
options are specified
.B pmproxy
accepts PCP client connections on  any of its host's IP addresses.
The
.B \-i
option is used to specify explicitly an IP address that PCP client connections should be
accepted on.
.I ipaddress
should be in the standard dotted form (e.g. 100.23.45.6).  The
.B \-i
option may be used multiple times to define a list of IP addresses.
When one or more
.B \-i
options is specified, attempted connections made on any other IP addresses will be refused.
.TP
\f3\-l\f1 \f2logfile\f1
By default a log file named
.I pmproxy.log
is written in the current directory.
The
.B \-l
option causes the log file to be written to
.I logfile
instead of the default.
If the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
written to the standard error instead.
.TP
\f3\-L\f1 \f2bytes\f1
.IR PDU s 
received by 
.B pmproxy 
from PCP monitoring clients are restricted to a
maximum size of 65536 bytes by default to defend against Denial of
Service attacks.  The 
.B \-L 
option may be used to change the maximum incoming 
.I PDU 
size.
.TP
\f3\-M\f1 \f2certname\f1
By default, pmproxy will try to use a certificate called
.B "PCP Collector certificate"
in its server role. The
.B \-M
option allows this to be changed.
.TP
\f3\-P\f1 \f2passfile\f1
Specify the path to a file containing the Network Security Services certificate
database password for (optional) secure connections, and for databases that are
password protected.
Refer also to the \f3\-C\f1 option.
When using this option, great care should be exercised to ensure appropriate
ownership ("pcp" user, typically) and permissions on this file (0400, so as to
be unreadable by any user other than the user running the
.B pmproxy
process).
.TP
\f3\-U\f1 \f2username\f1
Assume the identity of
.I username
before starting to accept incoming packets from PCP monitoring clients.
.TP
\f3\-x\f1 \f2file\f1
Before the
.B pmproxy
.I logfile
can be opened, 
.B pmproxy
may encounter a fatal error which prevents it from starting.  By default, the
output describing this error is sent to
.B /dev/tty
but it may redirected to 
.IR file .
.SH "STARTING AND STOPPING PMPROXY"
Normally,
.B pmproxy
is started automatically at boot time and stopped when the
system is being brought down.
Under certain circumstances it is necessary to start or stop
.B pmproxy
manually.
To do this one must become superuser and type
.PP
.ft CS
# $PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy start
.ft
.PP
to start
.BR pmproxy ,
or
.PP
.ft CS
# $PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy stop
.ft
.PP
to stop
.BR pmproxy .
Starting
.B pmproxy
when it is already running is the same as stopping
it and then starting it again.
.P
Normally
.B pmproxy
listens for PCP client connections on TCP/IP port number 44322
(registered at
.IR http://www.iana.org/ ).
Either the environment
variable
.B PMPROXY_PORT
.B \-p
command line option
may be used to specify alternative port number(s) when
.B PMPROXY_PORT
or the
.B \-p
command line option
may be used to specify alternative port number(s) when
.B pmproxy
is started; in each case, the specification is a comma-separated list
of one or more numerical port numbers.  Should both methods be used
or multiple
.B \-p
options appear on the command line,
.B pmproxy
will listen on the union of the set of ports specified via all
.B \-p
options and the
.B PMPROXY_PORT
environment variable.
If non-default ports are used with
.B pmproxy
care should be taken to ensure that
.B PMPROXY_PORT
is also set in the environment of any client application that
will connect to
.BR pmproxy ,
or that the extended host specification syntax is used
(see
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for details).
.SH FILES
.PD 0

default Network Security Services (NSS) certificate database
directory, used for optional Secure Socket Layer connections.
This database can be created and queried using the NSS
.B certutil
tool, amongst others.
.PD
.SH ENVIRONMENT
In addition to the PCP environment variables described in the
.B "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
section below, there are several environment variables that
influence the interactions between a PCP monitoring client,
.B pmcd
and
.BR pmcd (1).
.TP
.B PMCD_PORT
For the PCP monitoring client this (or the default port number) is passed to
.B pmproxy
and used to connect to
.BR pmcd (1).
In the environment of
.B pmproxy
.B PMCD_PORT is not used.
.TP
.B PMPROXY_HOST
For the PCP monitoring client this is the hostname or IP address of the
host where
.B pmproxy
is running.
In recent versions of PCP (since version 3) this has been superseded by
the extended hostname syntax
(see
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for details).
.TP
.B PMPROXY_PORT
For the PCP monitoring client this is the port on which
.B pmproxy
will accept connections.  The default is 44322.
.TP
.BR PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT ", " PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT " and " PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT
(see
.BR PCPIntro (1))
For the PCP monitoring client, setting these environment variables
will modify the timeouts used for interactions between the client
and
.BR pmproxy
(independent of which
.BR pmcd (1)
is being used).
For
.B pmproxy
these same environment variables control the timeouts between
.B pmproxy
and all
.BR pmcd (1)
instances (independent of which monitoring client is involved).
.PP
If set to the value 1, the
.B PMPROXY_LOCAL
environment variable will cause
.B pmproxy
to run in a localhost-only mode of operation, where it binds only
to the loopback interface.
.PP
The
.B PMPROXY_MAXPENDING
variable can be set to indicate the maximum length to which the queue
of pending client connections may grow.
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.B /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR PCPIntro (1),
.BR pmcd (1),
.BR pmdbg (1),
.BR pcp.conf (5)
and
.BR pcp.env (5).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If
.B pmproxy
is already running the message "Error: OpenRequestSocket bind: Address already
in use" will appear.
This may also appear if
.B pmproxy
was shutdown with an outstanding request from a client.
In this case, a
request socket has been left in the TIME_WAIT state and until the system closes
it down (after some timeout period) it will not be possible to run
.BR pmproxy .
.PP
In addition to the standard
.B PCP
debugging flags, see
.BR pmdbg (1),
.B pmproxy
currently uses
.B DBG_TRACE_CONTEXT
for tracing client connections and disconnections
