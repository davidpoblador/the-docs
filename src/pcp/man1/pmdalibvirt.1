.TH PMDALIBVIRT 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdalibvirt\f1 \- libvirt PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdalibvirt\f1 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (\s-1PMDA\s0) which
extracts live performance data from libvirt hypervisor and domains (VMs).
.PP
See the libvirt documentation for detailed description of each metric.
.PP
.SH INSTALLATION
\f3pmdalibvirt\f1 reads an optional ini-style configuration file
.IP "\(bu" 4
.I $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/libvirt/libvirt.conf
.PP
This file can contain in its \f3[pmda]\f1 section overriding values
for the following PMDA options:
.IP "\(bu" 4
oldapi
.IP "\(bu" 4
user
.IP "\(bu" 4
uri
.PP
By default, \f3False\f1, \f3root\f1 and \f3qemu:///system\f1 are used,
respectively.
.PP
The old API setting can be used in environments where recent libvirt API
additions are not available (e.g., RHEL 6 / libvirt-0.10.2) to provide
some of the metrics available with the newer API. Regardless of the API
version, no guest agent is needed for the metrics.
.PP
Note that using non-root user typically requires also libvirt side
configuration; please refer to libvirt documentation for further details
on this.
.PP
Once the needed setup is ready, you can test the connection and install
the PMDA to enable access to the names and values for the libvirt
performance metrics. To install, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/libvirt
.br
      # ./connect
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/libvirt
.br
      # ./Remove
.PP
\fBpmdalibvirt\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the
agent is installed or removed.

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
