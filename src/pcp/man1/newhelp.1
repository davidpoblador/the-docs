.TH NEWHELP 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3newhelp\f1 \- generate a performance metrics help database
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3$PCP_BINADM_DIR/newhelp\f1
[\f3\-V\f1]
[\f3\-n\f1 \f2pmnsfile\f1]
[\f3\-o\f1 \f2outputfile\f1]
[\f3\-v\f1 \f2version\f1]
[\f2file\f1 ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B newhelp
generates the
Performance Co-Pilot
help text files used by
Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDAs).
.PP
Normally
.B newhelp
operates on the default Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however
if the
.B \-n
option is specified an alternative namespace is loaded
from the file
.IR pmnsfile .
.PP
When there is only one input file,
the base name of the new database is derived from the name of the input
.IR file ,
otherwise the
.B \-o
flag must be given to explicitly name the database.
If no input files are supplied,
.B newhelp
reads from the standard input stream,
in which case the
.B \-o
flag must be given.
.PP
If the output file name is determined to be
.BR foo ,
.B newhelp
will create
.B foo.dir
and
.BR foo.pag .
.PP
Although historically there have been multiple help text file formats, the only
format currently supported
using the
.B \-v
option is
.I version
2, and
this is the default if no
.B \-v
flag is provided.
.PP
The
.B \-V
flag causes verbose messages to be printed while
.B newhelp
is parsing its input.
.PP
The first line of each entry in a help source file consists of an
\&``@''
character beginning the line
followed by a space and then
the performance metric name and a one line description of the metric.
Following lines (up to the next line beginning with ``@''
or end of file) may contain a verbose help description.
E.g.
.PP
.ft CW
.nf
.in +0.5i
#
# This is an example of newhelp's input syntax
#
@ kernel.all.cpu.idle CPU idle time
A cumulative count of the number of milliseconds
of CPU idle time, summed over all processors.
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
Three-part numeric metric identifiers (PMIDs) may be used in place of metric names,
e.g. \c
.ft CW
60.0.23
.ft 1
rather than
.ft CW
kernel.all.cpu.idle
.ft 1
in the example above.  Other than for dynamic metrics
(where the existence of a metric is known to
a PMDA, but not visible in the PMNS and hence has no name that
could be known to
.IR newhelp )
use of this syntactic variant is not encouraged.
.PP
Lines beginning with ``#''
are ignored, as are blank lines in the file before the first ``@''.
The verbose help text is optional.
.PP
As a special case,
a ``metric'' name of the form 
.I NNN.MM
(for numeric 
.I NNN
and 
.IR MM )
is interpreted as an
instance domain identification,
and the text describes the instance domain.
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 10
.BI $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/ *
default PMNS specification files
.PD
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).

.BR chkhelp (1),
.BR PMAPI (3),
.BR pmLookupInDomText (3),
.BR pmLookupText (3),

and
