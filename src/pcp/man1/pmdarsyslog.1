.TH PMDARSYSLOG 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdarsyslog\f1 \- rsyslog (reliable and extended syslog) PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdarsyslog\f1 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (\s-1PMDA\s0)
which exports metric values from the \fBrsyslogd\fR\|(8) server.
Further details about rsyslog can be found at http://www.rsyslog.com/.
.SH INSTALLATION
If you want access to the names and values for the rsyslog performance
metrics, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog
.br
      # ./Remove
.PP
\fBpmdarsyslog\fR is launched by \fBpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed 
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fBpmcd\fR(1) when the 
agent is installed or removed.
.PP
In order to use this agent, rsyslog stats gathering must be enabled.
This is done by adding the lines:
.PP
      $ModLoad impstats
.br
      $PStatsInterval 5       # log every 5 seconds
.br
      syslog.info             |/var/log/pcp/rsyslog/stats
.PP
to your \fIrsyslog.conf\fR\|(5) configuration file after installing the \s-1PMDA\s0.
Take care to ensure the syslog.info messages do not get logged in any
other file, as this could unexpectedly fill your filesystem.  Syntax
useful for this is syslog.!=info for explicitly excluding these.
.SH FILES
.IP "\fB$PCP_LOG_DIR/rsyslog/stats\fR" 4
named pipe containing statistics exported from rsyslog,
usually created by the \s-1PMDA\s0 Install script.
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog/rsyslog.conf\fR" 4
optional configuration file for \fBpmdarsyslog\fR
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog/Install\fR" 4

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables. 
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative 
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
