.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmlogextract
reads one or more Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive logs
identified by
.I input
and creates a temporally merged and/or reduced PCP archive log in
.IR output .
.I input
is a comma-separated list of names, each
of which may be the base name of an archive or the name of a directory containing
one or more archives.
The nature of merging is controlled by the number of input
archive logs, while the nature of data reduction is controlled by
the command line arguments.  The input(s) must be sets of PCP archive logs
created by
.BR pmlogger (1)
with performance data collected from the
.B same
host, but usually over different time periods and possibly (although
not usually) with different performance metrics being logged.
.PP
If only one
.I input
is specified, then the default behavior simply copies the input
set of PCP archive logs, into the output PCP archive log.  When two or
more sets of PCP archive logs are specified as
.IR input ,
the sets of logs are merged (or concatenated) and written to
.IR output .
.PP
In the output archive log a
.I <mark>
record will be inserted at a time
just past the end of each of the input archive logs to indicate
a possible temporal discontinuity between the end of one input
archive log and the start of the next input archive log.
See the
.B "MARK RECORDS"
section below for more information.
There is no
.I <mark>
record after the end of the
.I last
(in temporal order) of the input archive logs.
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
The command line options for
.B pmlogextract
are as follows:
.PP
.TP 7
.BI \-c " configfile"
Extract only the metrics specified in
.I configfile
from the
.I input
PCP archive log(s).  The
.I configfile
syntax accepted by
.B pmlogextract
is explained in more detail in the
.B Configuration File Syntax
section.
.PP
.TP 7
.B \-d
Desperate mode.  Normally if a fatal error occurs, all trace of
the partially written PCP archive
.I output
is removed.  With the
.B \-d
option, the
.I output
archive log is not removed.
.PP
.TP 7
.B \-f
For most common uses, all of the
input archive logs will have been collected in the same timezone.
But if this is not the case, then
.B pmlogextract
must choose one of the timezones from the input archive logs to be
used as the timezone for the output archive log.
The default is to use the timezone from the
.I last
input archive log.
The
.B \-f
option forces the timezone from the
.I first
input archive log to be used.
.TP 7
.BI \-S " starttime"
Define the start of a time window to restrict the samples retrieved
or specify a ``natural'' alignment of the output sample times; refer
to
.BR PCPIntro (1).
See also the
.B \-w
option.
.PP
.TP 7
.BI \-s " samples"
The argument
.I samples
defines the number of samples to be written to
.IR output .
If
.I samples
is 0 or
.B -s
is not specified,
.B pmlogextract
will sample until the end of the PCP archive log,
or the end of the time window as specified by
.BR -T ,
whichever comes first.  The
.B -s
option will override the
.B -T
option if it occurs sooner.
.PP
.TP 7
.BI \-T " endtime"
Define the termination of a time window to restrict the samples
retrieved or specify a ``natural'' alignment of the output sample
times; refer to
.BR PCPIntro (1).
See also the
.B \-w
option.
.PP
.TP 7
.BI \-v " volsamples"
The
.I output
archive log is potentially a multi-volume data set, and the
.B \-v
option causes
.B pmlogextract
to start a new volume after
.I volsamples
log records have been written to the archive log.
.RS 7
.PP
Independent of any
.B \-v
option, each volume of an archive is limited to no more than
2^31 bytes, so
.I pmlogextract
will automatically create a new volume for the archive before
this limit is reached.
.RE
.PP
.TP 7
.B \-w
Where
.B \-S
and
.B \-T
specify a time window within the same day, the
.B \-w
flag will cause the data within the time window to be extracted,
for every day in the archive log.
For example, the options
.B \-w \-S "@11:00" \-T "@15:00"
specify that
.B pmlogextract
should include archive log records only for the periods from 11am
to 3pm on each day.  When
.B \-w
is used, the
.I output
archive log will contain
.I <mark>
records to indicate the temporal
discontinuity between the end of one time window and the start of
the next.
.PP
.TP 7
.BI \-Z " timezone"
Use
.I timezone
when displaying the date and time.
.I Timezone
is in the format of the environment variable
.B TZ
as described in
.BR environ (7).
.PP
.TP 7
.B \-z
Use the local timezone of the host from the input archive logs.
The default is to initially use the timezone of the local host.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
The
.I configfile
contains metrics of interest \- only those metrics (or instances)
mentioned explicitly or implicitly in the configuration file will be
included in the
.I output
archive.
Each specifications must begin on a new line, and may span multiple lines
in the configuration file.
Instances
may also be specified, but they are optional.  The format for
each specification is

        metric [[instance[,instance...]]]

where
.I metric
may be a leaf or a non-leaf name in the Performance Metrics
Name Space (PMNS, see
.BR pmns (5)).
If a metric refers to a non-leaf node in the PMNS,
.B pmlogextract
will recursively descend the PMNS and include all metrics
corresponding to descendent leaf nodes.
.PP
Instances are
optional, and may be specified as a list of one or more
space (or comma) separated names, numbers or strings (enclosed
in single or double quotes).
Elements in the list that are numbers are assumed to be internal
instance identifiers - see
.BR pmGetInDom (3)
for more information.
If no instances are given, then 
.B all
instances of the associated metric(s) will be extracted.
.PP
Any additional white space is ignored and
comments may be added with a `#' prefix.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE EXAMPLE
This is an example of a valid
.IR configfile :
.PP
        #
        # config file for pmlogextract
        #

        kernel.all.cpu
        kernel.percpu.cpu.sys ["cpu0","cpu1"]
        disk.dev ["dks0d1"]
.SH MARK RECORDS
When more than one input archive log contributes performance data to the
output archive log, then
.I <mark>
records are inserted to indicate a possible
discontinuity in the performance data.
.PP
A
.I <mark>
record contains a timestamp and no performance data and
is used to indicate that there is a time period
in the PCP archive log where we do not know the values of
.B any
performance metrics, because there was no
.BR pmlogger (1)
collecting performance data during this period.  Since these periods are
often associated with the restart of a service or
.BR pmcd (1)
or a system, there may be considerable doubt as to the continuity of
performance data across this time period.
.PP
The rationale behind
.I <mark>
records may be demonstrated with an example.
Consider one input archive log that starts at 00:10 and ends at 09:15 on the
same day, and another input archive log that starts at 09:20 on the
same day and ends at 00:10 the following morning.  This would be a very
common case for archives managed and rotated by
.BR pmlogger_check (1)
and
.BR pmlogger_daily (1).
.PP
The output archive log created by
.B pmlogextract
would contain:
.ta 12n
.br
00:10.000	first record from first input archive log
.br
\&...
.br
09:15.000	last record from first input archive log
.br
09:15.001	<mark> record
.br
09:20.000	first record from second input archive log
.br
\&...
.br
01:10.000	last record from second input archive log
.PP
The time period where the performance data is missing starts just after
09:15 and ends just before 09:20.
When the output archive log is processed with any of the PCP reporting
tools, the
.I <mark>
record is used to indicate a period of missing
data.  For example using the output archive above, imagine one was reporting the average
I/O rate at 30 minute intervals
aligned on the hour and half-hour.
The I/O count metric is a counter, so the
average I/O rate requires two valid values from
consecutive sample times.
There would be
values for all the intervals ending at 09:00,
then no values at 09:30 because of the
.I <mark>
record, then no values at 10:00 because the ``prior'' value at 09:30 is not
available, then the rate would be reported again at 10:30 and continue
every 30 minutes until the last reported value at 01:00.
.PP
The presence of
.I <mark>
records in a PCP archive log can be established
using
.BR pmdumplog (1)
where a timestamp and the annotation
.B <mark>
is used to indicate a
.I <mark>
record.
.SH METADATA CHECKS
When more than one
.I input
archive set is specified, 
.B pmlogextract
performs a number of checks to ensure the metadata is consistent for
metrics appearing in more than one of the
.I input
archive sets.
These checks include:
.IP * 2n
metric data type is the same
.PD 0
.IP * 2n
metric semantics are the same
.IP * 2n
metric units are the same
.IP * 2n
metric is either always singular or always has the same instance domain
.IP * 2n
metrics with the same name have the same PMID
.IP * 2n
metrics with the same PMID have the same name
.PD
.PP
If any of these checks fail,
.B pmlogextract
reports the details and aborts without creating the
.I output
archive.
.PP
To address these semantic issues, use
.BR pmlogrewrite (1)
to translate the
.I input
archives into equivalent archives with consistent metdadata before using
.BR pmlogextract .
.SH FILES
.PD 0
For each of the
.I input
and
.I output
archive logs, several physical files are used.
.TP 10
\f2archive\f3.meta
metadata (metric descriptions, instance domains, etc.) for the archive log
.TP
\f2archive\f3.0
initial volume of metrics values (subsequent volumes have suffixes
.BR 1 ,
.BR 2 ,
\&...) \- for
.I input
these files may have been previously compressed with
.BR bzip2 (1)
or
.BR gzip (1)
and thus may have an additional
.B .bz2
or
.B .gz
suffix.
.TP
\f2archive\f3.index
temporal index to support rapid random access to the other files in the
archive log.
.PD
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR PCPIntro (1),
.BR pmdumplog (1),
.BR pmlc (1),
.BR pmlogger (1),
.BR pmlogreduce (1),
.BR pmlogrewrite (1),
.BR pcp.conf (5)
and
.BR pcp.env (5).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All error conditions detected by
.B pmlogextract
are reported on
.I stderr
with textual (if sometimes terse) explanation.
.PP
Should one of the input archive logs be corrupted (this can happen
if the
.B pmlogger
instance writing the log suddenly dies), then
.B pmlogextract
will detect and report the position of the corruption in the file,
and any subsequent information from that archive log will not be processed.
.PP
If any error is detected,
.B pmlogextract
will exit with a non-zero status.
.SH CAVEATS
The preamble metrics (pmcd.pmlogger.archive, pmcd.pmlogger.host,
and pmcd.pmlogger.port), which are automatically recorded by
.B pmlogger
at the start of the archive, may not be present in the archive output by
.BR pmlogextract .
These metrics are only relevant while the archive is being created,
and have no significance once recording has finished.
