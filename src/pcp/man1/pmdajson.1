.TH PMDAJSON 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdajson\f1 \- JSON PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpmdajson\fR is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports 
metrics from arbitrary sources generating Javascript Object Notation (JSON)
syntax, describing metric metadata and values.
.PP
Further details on the JSON format can be found at http://www.json.org
.SH JSON DATA SOURCES
\fBpmdajson\fR searches the directories listed in the "directory_list"
and "trusted_directory_list" config file options, looking for files
called "metadata.json". These JSON metadata files describe the names,
types, etc. of their associated JSON data. For example, let's assume
the following simple JSON data file:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
  {
    "string_value": "testing, 1, 2, 3",
    "read_count": 0
  }
.fam T
.fi
.PP
The associated metadata file would look like the following:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
  {
    "metrics": [
      {
        "name": "string_value",
        "pointer": "/string_value",
        "type": "string",
      },
      {
        "name": "read_count",
        "pointer": "/read_count",
        "type": "integer",
        "description": "Times values read"
      }
    ]
  }
.fam T
.fi
.PP
For more details on the JSON metadata format, see the README file
included with \fBpmdajson\fR.
.SH SECURITY MODEL
JSON sources that come from "directory_list" config file option
aren't "trusted", and any command that needs to be run to get JSON
data is run as user "nobody".
.PP
JSON sources that come from "trusted_directory_list" config file
option are trusted, and any command that needs to be run to get
JSON data is run as user "root".
.PP
For more details on security, see the README file
included with \fBpmdajson\fR.
.SH INSTALLATION
Install the json PMDA by using the Install script as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/json
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/json
.br
      # ./Remove
.PP
\fBpmdajson\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed 
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the 
agent is installed or removed.

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables. 
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative 
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
