.SH DESCRIPTION
As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
.BR LOGIMPORT (3)),
.B pmiPutResult
provides an interface for developers familiar with the internal
PCP data structures to create output archives directly.
.PP
By building the
.B pmResult
data structure directly, then calling
.B pmiPutResult
the developer avoids calls to
.BR pmiPutValue (3)
and/or
.BR pmiPutValueHandle (3)
followed by a call to
.BR pmiWrite (3)
for each record written to the archive.
.PP
Any metrics and instances appearing in the
.I result
must have been defined by prior calls to
.BR pmiAddMetric (3)
and
.BR pmiAddInstance (3).
.PP
.B pmiPutResult
will arrange for any new metadata (metrics and/or instance domain changes)
covered by
.I result
to be also written to the PCP archive.
.PP
Because of the complexity of the
.B pmResult
data structure, this routine is not available in the Perl
interface to the LOGIMPORT services.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B pmiPutResult
returns zero on success else a negative value that can be turned into an
error message by calling
.BR pmiErrStr (3).

.BR PMAPI (3),
.BR pmiAddInstance (3),
.BR pmiAddMetric (3),
.BR pmiErrStr (3),

.BR pmiSetTimezone (3)
and
.BR pmiWrite (3).
