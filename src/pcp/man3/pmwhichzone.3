.SH DESCRIPTION
The current reporting timezone effects the timezone used by
.BR pmCtime (3)
and
.BR pmLocaltime (3).
.PP
.B pmWhichZone
returns the handle of the current timezone,
as previously established by
a call to
.BR pmNewZone (3)
or
.BR pmNewContextZone (3).
If the call is successful (i.e. there exists a current reporting timezone)
then a non-negative integer is returned and
.I tz
is set to point to a static buffer containing the timezone string itself.
