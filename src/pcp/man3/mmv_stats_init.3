.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\f3mmv_stats_init\f1 creates and initializes the content of the 
\f2MMV\f1(5) file, returning a handle that is used in subsequent
MMV API calls.
.P
\f3mmv_stats_stop\f1 performs an orderly shutdown of the mapping
handle returned by an earlier initialization call.
.P
The file is created in the $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv directory, \f2name\f1
argument is expected to be a basename of the file, not the full path.
The metadata content of the file does not change after the file has
been created. 
.P
The old file is removed unconditionally unless there was an error.
.P
\f2cluster\f1 is the preferred MMV PMDA cluster ID to be used for
the metrics originating from this call to \f3mmv_stats_init\f1.
The \f2flags\f1 provide additional control over the behaviour
of the MMV PMDA - e.g. use of MMV_FLAG_PROCESS will ensure values
are only exported when the instrumented application is running \-
this is verified on each request for new values.
.P
\f2stats\f1 is the array of \f3mmv_metric_t\f1 elements of length
\f2nstats\f1. Each element of the array describes one PCP metric.
.P
.nf
        typedef struct {
            char name[MMV_NAMEMAX];     /* Name of the metric */
            __uint32_t item;            /* Item component of PMID */
            mmv_metric_type_t type;     /* Type of the metric */
            mmv_metric_sem_t semantics; /* Semantics of the metric */
            pmUnits dimension;          /* Dimensions (TIME,SPACE,etc) */
            __uint32_t indom;           /* Instance domain identifier */
            char *shorttext;            /* Optional, one-line help */
            char *helptext;             /* Optional, full help text */
        } mmv_metric_t;
.fi
.P
If \f3indom\f1 is not zero and not PM_INDOM_NULL, then the metric has
multiple values and there must be a corresponding \f2indom\f1 entry
in the \f2indom\f1 list (uniquely identified by \f3serial\f1 number).
.P
The \f2stats\f1 array cannot contain any elements which have no name -
this is considered an error and no metrics will be exported in this case.
.P
\f2indoms\f1 is the array of \f3mmv_indom_t\f1 elements of length
\f2nindoms\f1. Each element of the array describes one PCP instance
domain.
