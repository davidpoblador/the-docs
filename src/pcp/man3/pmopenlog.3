.SH DESCRIPTION
.B __pmOpenLog
reassigns the standard I/O stream
.I oldstream
to be associated with the file
.IR logname .
If it already exists,
.I logname
will be removed and recreated if possible (to ensure correct ownership
and permissions from the caller to
.BR __pmOpenLog ).
.PP
On return, the function value is the new standard I/O stream.  In the
event of an error, this will be
.I oldstream
unchanged and
.I status
will be 0.
.PP
For success,
.I status
is 1, a standard preamble is written to
.I logname
