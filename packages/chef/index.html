<dl class="dl-vertical">
 <dt><a href="/man-pages/man1/chef-shell.1.html"><strong>chef-shell.1</strong></a></dt>

 <dd>The man page for the chef-shell command line tool.  chef-shell is a recipe debugging tool that allows the use of breakpoints within recipes. chef-shell runs as an interactive ruby (irb) session. chef-shell supports both recipe and attribute file syntax, as well as interactive debugging features. chef-shell is the new name for shef as of chef 11.x. chef-shell is backwards compatible and aside from the name change, has the same set of functionality as with previous releases.  the chef-shell executable can be run as a command-line tool.</dd>

 <dt><a href="/man-pages/man1/knife.1.html"><strong>knife.1</strong></a></dt>

 <dd>The man page for the knife command line tool.  knife is a command-line tool that provides an interface between a local chef-repo and the server. knife helps users to manage: nodes cookbooks and recipes roles stores of json data (data bags), including encrypted data environments cloud resources, including provisioning the installation of the chef-client on management workstations searching of indexed data on the server  knife subcommands: knife bootstrap knife client knife configure knife cookbook knife cookbook site knife data bag knife delete knife deps knife diff knife download knife edit knife environment knife exec knife list knife node knife raw knife recipe list knife role knife search knife show knife ssh knife status knife tag knife upload knife user knife xargs</dd>

 <dt><a href="/man-pages/man1/knife-bootstrap.1.html"><strong>knife-bootstrap.1</strong></a></dt>

 <dd>The man page for the knife bootstrap subcommand.  a bootstrap is a process that installs the chef-client on a target system so that it can run as a chef-client and communicate with a server.  the knife bootstrap subcommand is used run a bootstrap operation that installs the chef-client on the target system. the bootstrap operation must specify the ip address or fqdn of the target system.  syntax  this argument has the following syntax:</dd>

 <dt><a href="/man-pages/man1/knife-client.1.html"><strong>knife-client.1</strong></a></dt>

 <dd>The man page for the knife client subcommand.  when a node runs the chef-client for the first time, it generally does not yet have an api client identity, and so it cannot make authenticated requests to the server. this is where the validation client---known as the chef-validator---comes in. when the chef-client runs, it checks if it has a client key. if the client key does not exist, it then attempts to borrow the identity of the chef-validator to register itself with the server. in order to register with the server, the private key for the chef-validator needs to be copied to the host and placed in /etc/chef/validation.pem.  once the chef-client has registered itself with the server, it no longer uses the validation client for anything. it is recommended that you delete the private key for the chef-validator from the host after the host has registered or use the delete_validation recipe that can be found in the chef-client cookbook (https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-client).  the knife client subcommand is used to manage an api client list and their associated rsa public key-pairs. this allows authentication requests to be made to the server by any entity that uses the chef server api, such as the chef-client and knife.</dd>

 <dd>The man page for the knife cookbook subcommand.  a cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution. each cookbook defines a scenario, such as everything needed to install and configure mysql, and then it contains all of the components that are required to support that scenario, including: attribute values that are set on nodes definitions that allow the creation of reusable collections of resources file distributions libraries that extend the chef-client and/or provide helpers to ruby code recipes that specify which resources to manage and the order in which those resources will be applied custom resources and providers templates versions metadata about recipes (including dependencies), version constraints, supported platforms, and so on  the knife cookbook subcommand is used to interact with cookbooks that are located on the server or the local chef-repo.</dd>

 <dt><a href="/man-pages/man1/knife-cookbook-site.1.html"><strong>knife-cookbook-site.1</strong></a></dt>

 <dd>The man page for the knife cookbook site subcommand.  the cookbooks site api is used to provide access to the cookbooks community hosted at https://cookbooks.opscode.com. all of the cookbooks in the community are accessible through a rest api located at https://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/ by using any of the supported endpoints. in most cases, using knife and the knife cookbook site sub-command (and any of its arguments) is the recommended method of interacting with these cookbooks, but in some cases, using the rest api directly may make sense.  the knife cookbook site subcommand is used to interact with cookbooks that are located at https://cookbooks.opscode.com. a user account is required for any community actions that write data to this site. the following arguments do not require a user account: download, search, install, and list.</dd>

 <dt><a href="/man-pages/man1/knife-exec.1.html"><strong>knife-exec.1</strong></a></dt>

 <dd>The man page for the knife exec subcommand.  the knife exec subcommand uses the knife configuration file to execute ruby scripts in the context of a fully configured chef-client. this subcommand is most often used to run scripts that will only access server one time (or otherwise very infrequently). use this subcommand any time that an operation does not warrant full usage of the knife subcommand library.  authenticated api requests  the knife exec subcommand can be used to make authenticated api requests to the server using the following methods:</dd>
