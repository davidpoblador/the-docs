  <p>The CONFORMING TO section that appears in many manual pages identifies various standards to which the documented interface conforms. The following list briefly describes these standards.</p>
  <dl class='dl-vertical'>
    <dt><strong>V7</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Version 7 (also known as Seventh Edition) UNIX, released by AT&T/Bell Labs in 1979. After this point, UNIX systems diverged into two main dialects: BSD and System V.</p>

    </dd>
    <dt><strong>System V</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>This is an implementation standard defined by AT&T's milestone 1983 release of its commercial System V (five) release. The previous major AT&T release was <em>System III</em>, released in 1981.</p>

    <dt><strong>System V release 2 (SVr2)</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>This was the next System V release, made in 1985. The SVr2 was formally described in the <em>"System V Interface Definition version 1"</em> (<em>SVID 1</em>) published in 1985.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>System V release 3 (SVr3)</strong></dt>

    <dt><strong>C89</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>This was the first C language standard, ratified by ANSI (American National Standards Institute) in 1989 (<em>X3.159-1989</em>). Sometimes this is known as <em>ANSI C</em>, but since C99 is also an ANSI standard, this term is ambiguous. This standard was also ratified by ISO (International Standards Organization) in 1990 (<em>ISO/IEC 9899:1990</em>), and is thus occasionally referred to as <em>ISO C90</em>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>C99</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>This revision of the C language standard was ratified by ISO in 1999 (<em>ISO/IEC 9899:1999</em>). Available online at</p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards</a>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>C11</strong></dt>

    <dt><strong>POSIX.1-1996</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>A 1996 revision of POSIX.1 which incorporated POSIX.1b and POSIX.1c.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>XPG3</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Released in 1989, this was the first significant release of the <em>X/Open Portability Guide</em>, produced by the X/Open Company, a multivendor consortium. This multivolume guide was based on the POSIX standards.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>XPG4</strong></dt>
    <dd>

    </dd>
    <dt><strong>XPG4v2</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>A 1994 revision of XPG4. This is also referred to as <em>Spec 1170</em>, where 1170 referred to the number of interfaces defined by this standard.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>"SUS (SUSv1)"</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Single UNIX Specification. This was a repackaging of XPG4v2 and other X/Open standards (X/Open Curses Issue 4 version 2, X/Open Networking Service (XNS) Issue 4). Systems conforming to this standard can be branded <em>UNIX 95</em>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>SUSv2</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Single UNIX Specification version 2. Sometimes also referred to as <em>XPG5</em>. This standard appeared in 1997. Systems conforming to this standard can be branded <em>UNIX 98</em>. See also</p><a href="http://www.UNIX-systems.org/version2/">http://www.UNIX-systems.org/version2/</a>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>POSIX.1-2001, SUSv3</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>This was a 2001 revision and consolidation of the POSIX.1, POSIX.2, and SUS standards into a single document, conducted under the auspices of the Austin Group</p><a href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/">http://www.opengroup.org/austin/</a>
  <p>The standard is available online at</p><a href="http://www.unix-systems.org/version3/">http://www.unix-systems.org/version3/</a>
  <p>and the interfaces that it describes are also available in the Linux manual pages package under sections 1p and 3p (e.g., "man 3p open").</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>The standard defines two levels of conformance: <em>POSIX conformance</em>, which is a baseline set of interfaces required of a conforming system; and <em>XSI Conformance,</em> which additionally mandates a set of interfaces (the "XSI extension") which are only optional for POSIX conformance. XSI-conformant systems can be branded <em>UNIX 03</em>. (XSI conformance constitutes the <em>"Single UNIX Specification version 3"</em> (<em>SUSv3</em>).)</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>The POSIX.1-2001 document is broken into four parts:</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p><strong>XBD</strong>: Definitions, terms and concepts, header file specifications.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p><strong>XSH</strong>: Specifications of functions (i.e., system calls and library functions in actual implementations).</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p><strong>XCU</strong>: Specifications of commands and utilities (i.e., the area formerly described by POSIX.2).</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p><strong>XRAT</strong>: Informative text on the other parts of the standard.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>POSIX.1-2001 is aligned with C99, so that all of the library functions standardized in C99 are also standardized in POSIX.1-2001.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>Two Technical Corrigenda (minor fixes and improvements) of the original 2001 standard have occurred: TC1 in 2003 (also known as <em>POSIX.1-2003</em>), and TC2 in 2004 (also known as <em>POSIX.1-2004</em>).</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>POSIX.1-2008, SUSv4</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Work on the next revision of POSIX.1/SUS was completed and ratified in 2008.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>The changes in this revision are not as large as those that occurred for POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3, but a number of new interfaces are added and various details of existing specifications are modified. Many of the interfaces that were optional in POSIX.1-2001 become mandatory in the 2008 revision of the standard. A few interfaces that are present in POSIX.1-2001 are marked as obsolete in POSIX.1-2008, or removed from the standard altogether.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>The revised standard is broken into the same four parts as POSIX.1-2001, and again there are two levels of conformance: the baseline <em>POSIX Conformance</em>, and <em>XSI Conformance</em>, which mandates an additional set of interfaces beyond those in the base specification.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>In general, where the CONFORMING TO section of a manual page lists POSIX.1-2001, it can be assumed that the interface also conforms to POSIX.1-2008, unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>Technical Corrigendum 1 (minor fixes and improvements) of this standard was released in 2013 (also known as <em>POSIX.1-2013</em>).</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>Technical Corrigendum 2 of this standard is set to be released in 2016 (also known as <em>POSIX.1-2016</em>).</p>
