      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>This is an implementation of the TCP protocol defined in RFC&nbsp;793, RFC&nbsp;1122 and RFC&nbsp;2001 with the NewReno and SACK extensions. It provides a reliable, stream-oriented, full-duplex connection between two sockets on top of <strong>ip</strong>(7), for both v4 and v6 versions. TCP guarantees that the data arrives in order and retransmits lost packets. It generates and checks a per-packet checksum to catch transmission errors. TCP does not preserve record boundaries.</p><p>A newly created TCP socket has no remote or local address and is not fully specified. To create an outgoing TCP connection use <a href="../man2/connect.2.html"><strong>connect</strong>(2)</a> to establish a connection to another TCP socket. To receive new incoming connections, first <a href="../man2/bind.2.html"><strong>bind</strong>(2)</a> the socket to a local address and port and then call <a href="../man2/listen.2.html"><strong>listen</strong>(2)</a> to put the socket into the listening state. After that a new socket for each incoming connection can be accepted using <a href="../man2/accept.2.html"><strong>accept</strong>(2)</a>. A socket which has had <a href="../man2/accept.2.html"><strong>accept</strong>(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/connect.2.html"><strong>connect</strong>(2)</a> successfully called on it is fully specified and may transmit data. Data cannot be transmitted on listening or not yet connected sockets.</p><p>Linux supports RFC&nbsp;1323 TCP high performance extensions. These include Protection Against Wrapped Sequence Numbers (PAWS), Window Scaling and Timestamps. Window scaling allows the use of large (&gt; 64K) TCP windows in order to support links with high latency or bandwidth. To make use of them, the send and receive buffer sizes must be increased. They can be set globally with the <em>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem</em> and <em>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem</em> files, or on individual sockets by using the <strong>SO_SNDBUF</strong> and <strong>SO_RCVBUF</strong> socket options with the <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html"><strong>setsockopt</strong>(2)</a> call.</p><p>The maximum sizes for socket buffers declared via the <strong>SO_SNDBUF</strong> and <strong>SO_RCVBUF</strong> mechanisms are limited by the values in the <em>/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max</em> and <em>/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max</em> files. Note that TCP actually allocates twice the size of the buffer requested in the <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html"><strong>setsockopt</strong>(2)</a> call, and so a succeeding <a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html"><strong>getsockopt</strong>(2)</a> call will not return the same size of buffer as requested in the <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html"><strong>setsockopt</strong>(2)</a> call. TCP uses the extra space for administrative purposes and internal kernel structures, and the <em>/proc</em> file values reflect the larger sizes compared to the actual TCP windows. On individual connections, the socket buffer size must be set prior to the <a href="../man2/listen.2.html"><strong>listen</strong>(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/connect.2.html"><strong>connect</strong>(2)</a> calls in order to have it take effect. See <a href="../man7/socket.7.html"><strong>socket</strong>(7)</a> for more information.</p><p>TCP supports urgent data. Urgent data is used to signal the receiver that some important message is part of the data stream and that it should be processed as soon as possible. To send urgent data specify the <strong>MSG_OOB</strong> option to <a href="../man2/send.2.html"><strong>send</strong>(2)</a>. When urgent data is received, the kernel sends a <strong>SIGURG</strong> signal to the process or process group that has been set as the socket "owner" using the <strong>SIOCSPGRP</strong> or <strong>FIOSETOWN</strong> ioctls (or the POSIX.1-specified <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html"><strong>fcntl</strong>(2)</a> <strong>F_SETOWN</strong> operation). When the <strong>SO_OOBINLINE</strong> socket option is enabled, urgent data is put into the normal data stream (a program can test for its location using the <strong>SIOCATMARK</strong> ioctl described below), otherwise it can be received only when the <strong>MSG_OOB</strong> flag is set for <a href="../man2/recv.2.html"><strong>recv</strong>(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html"><strong>recvmsg</strong>(2)</a>.</p><p>Linux 2.4 introduced a number of changes for improved throughput and scaling, as well as enhanced functionality. Some of these features include support for zero-copy <a href="../man2/sendfile.2.html"><strong>sendfile</strong>(2)</a>, Explicit Congestion Notification, new management of TIME_WAIT sockets, keep-alive socket options and support for Duplicate SACK extensions.</p><h3>Address formats</h3>
<p>TCP is built on top of IP (see <strong>ip</strong>(7)). The address formats defined by <strong>ip</strong>(7) apply to TCP. TCP supports point-to-point communication only; broadcasting and multicasting are not supported.</p>
<h3>/proc interfaces</h3>
<p>System-wide TCP parameter settings can be accessed by files in the directory <em>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/</em>. In addition, most IP <em>/proc</em> interfaces also apply to TCP; see <strong>ip</strong>(7). Variables described as <em>Boolean</em> take an integer value, with a nonzero value ("true") meaning that the corresponding option is enabled, and a zero value ("false") meaning that the option is disabled.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_abc</em> (Integer; default: 0; since Linux 2.6.15)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Control the Appropriate Byte Count (ABC), defined in RFC 3465. ABC is a way of increasing the congestion window (<em>cwnd</em>) more slowly in response to partial acknowledgments. Possible values are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    0
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>increase <em>cwnd</em> once per acknowledgment (no ABC)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    1
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>increase <em>cwnd</em> once per acknowledgment of full sized segment</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    2
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>allow increase <em>cwnd</em> by two if acknowledgment is of two segments to compensate for delayed acknowledgments.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_abort_on_overflow</em> (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.4)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable resetting connections if the listening service is too slow and unable to keep up and accept them. It means that if overflow occurred due to a burst, the connection will recover. Enable this option <em>only</em> if you are really sure that the listening daemon cannot be tuned to accept connections faster. Enabling this option can harm the clients of your server.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_adv_win_scale</em> (integer; default: 2; since Linux 2.4)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Count buffering overhead as <em>bytes/2^tcp_adv_win_scale</em>, if <em>tcp_adv_win_scale</em> is greater than 0; or <em>bytes-bytes/2^(-tcp_adv_win_scale)</em>, if <em>tcp_adv_win_scale</em> is less than or equal to zero.</p><p>The socket receive buffer space is shared between the application and kernel. TCP maintains part of the buffer as the TCP window, this is the size of the receive window advertised to the other end. The rest of the space is used as the "application" buffer, used to isolate the network from scheduling and application latencies. The <em>tcp_adv_win_scale</em> default value of 2 implies that the space used for the application buffer is one fourth that of the total.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_allowed_congestion_control</em> (String; default: see text; since Linux 2.4.20)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Show/set the congestion control algorithm choices available to unprivileged processes (see the description of the <strong>TCP_CONGESTION</strong> socket option). The items in the list are separated by white space and terminated by a newline character. The list is a subset of those listed in <em>tcp_available_congestion_control</em>. The default value for this list is "reno" plus the default setting of <em>tcp_congestion_control</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_autocorking</em> (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 3.14)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this option is enabled, the kernel tries to coalesce small writes (from consecutive <a href="../man2/write.2.html"><strong>write</strong>(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/sendmsg.2.html"><strong>sendmsg</strong>(2)</a> calls) as much as possible, in order to decrease the total number of sent packets. Coalescing is done if at least one prior packet for the flow is waiting in Qdisc queues or device transmit queue. Applications can still use the <strong>TCP_CORK</strong> socket option to obtain optimal behavior when they know how/when to uncork their sockets.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_available_congestion_control</em> (String; read-only; since Linux 2.4.20)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Show a list of the congestion-control algorithms that are registered. The items in the list are separated by white space and terminated by a newline character. This list is a limiting set for the list in <em>tcp_allowed_congestion_control</em>. More congestion-control algorithms may be available as modules, but not loaded.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_app_win</em> (integer; default: 31; since Linux 2.4)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This variable defines how many bytes of the TCP window are reserved for buffering overhead.</p><p>A maximum of (<em>window/2^tcp_app_win</em>, mss) bytes in the window are reserved for the application buffer. A value of 0 implies that no amount is reserved.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_base_mss</em> (Integer; default: 512; since Linux 2.6.17)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The initial value of <em>search_low</em> to be used by the packetization layer Path MTU discovery (MTU probing). If MTU probing is enabled, this is the initial MSS used by the connection.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_bic</em> (Boolean; default: disabled; Linux 2.4.27/2.6.6 to 2.6.13)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable BIC TCP congestion control algorithm. BIC-TCP is a sender-side-only change that ensures a linear RTT fairness under large windows while offering both scalability and bounded TCP-friendliness. The protocol combines two schemes called additive increase and binary search increase. When the congestion window is large, additive increase with a large increment ensures linear RTT fairness as well as good scalability. Under small congestion windows, binary search increase provides TCP friendliness.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_bic_low_window</em> (integer; default: 14; Linux 2.4.27/2.6.6 to 2.6.13)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the threshold window (in packets) where BIC TCP starts to adjust the congestion window. Below this threshold BIC TCP behaves the same as the default TCP Reno.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_bic_fast_convergence</em> (Boolean; default: enabled; Linux 2.4.27/2.6.6 to 2.6.13)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Force BIC TCP to more quickly respond to changes in congestion window. Allows two flows sharing the same connection to converge more rapidly.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_congestion_control</em> (String; default: see text; since Linux 2.4.13)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the default congestion-control algorithm to be used for new connections. The algorithm "reno" is always available, but additional choices may be available depending on kernel configuration. The default value for this file is set as part of kernel configuration.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_dma_copybreak</em> (integer; default: 4096; since Linux 2.6.24)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Lower limit, in bytes, of the size of socket reads that will be offloaded to a DMA copy engine, if one is present in the system and the kernel was configured with the <strong>CONFIG_NET_DMA</strong> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_dsack</em> (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.4)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable RFC&nbsp;2883 TCP Duplicate SACK support.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_ecn</em> (Integer; default: se below; since Linux 2.4)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable RFC&nbsp;3168 Explicit Congestion Notification.</p><p>This file can have one of the following values:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    0
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Disable ECN. Neither initiate nor accept ECN. This was the default up to and including Linux 2.6.30.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    1
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable ECN when requested by incoming connections and also request ECN on outgoing connection attempts.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    2
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable ECN when requested by incoming connections, but do not request ECN on outgoing connections. This value is supported, and is the default, since Linux 2.6.31.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<ul>
<li><p>When enabled, connectivity to some destinations could be affected due to older, misbehaving middle boxes along the path, causing connections to be dropped. However, to facilitate and encourage deployment with option 1, and to work around such buggy equipment, the <strong>tcp_ecn_fallback</strong> option has been introduced.</p></li>
</ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_ecn_fallback</em> (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 4.1)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable RFC&nbsp;3168, Section 6.1.1.1. fallback. When enabled, outgoing ECN-setup SYNs that time out within the normal SYN retransmission timeout will be resent with CWR and ECE cleared.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_fack</em> (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.2)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable TCP Forward Acknowledgement support.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_fin_timeout</em> (integer; default: 60; since Linux 2.2)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This specifies how many seconds to wait for a final FIN packet before the socket is forcibly closed. This is strictly a violation of the TCP specification, but required to prevent denial-of-service attacks. In Linux 2.2, the default value was 180.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_frto</em> (integer; default: 0; since Linux 2.4.21/2.6)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable F-RTO, an enhanced recovery algorithm for TCP retransmission timeouts (RTOs). It is particularly beneficial in wireless environments where packet loss is typically due to random radio interference rather than intermediate router congestion. See RFC 4138 for more details.</p><p>This file can have one of the following values:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    0
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Disabled.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    1
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The basic version F-RTO algorithm is enabled.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    2
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable SACK-enhanced F-RTO if flow uses SACK. The basic version can be used also when SACK is in use though in that case scenario(s) exists where F-RTO interacts badly with the packet counting of the SACK-enabled TCP flow.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<ul>
<li><p>Before Linux 2.6.22, this parameter was a Boolean value, supporting just values 0 and 1 above.</p></li>
</ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_frto_response</em> (integer; default: 0; since Linux 2.6.22)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When F-RTO has detected that a TCP retransmission timeout was spurious (i.e., the timeout would have been avoided had TCP set a longer retransmission timeout), TCP has several options concerning what to do next. Possible values are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    0
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Rate halving based; a smooth and conservative response, results in halved congestion window (<em>cwnd</em>) and slow-start threshold (<em>ssthresh</em>) after one RTT.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    1
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Very conservative response; not recommended because even though being valid, it interacts poorly with the rest of Linux TCP; halves <em>cwnd</em> and <em>ssthresh</em> immediately.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    2
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Aggressive response; undoes congestion-control measures that are now known to be unnecessary (ignoring the possibility of a lost retransmission that would require TCP to be more cautious); <em>cwnd</em> and <em>ssthresh</em> are restored to the values prior to timeout.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_keepalive_intvl</em> (integer; default: 75; since Linux 2.4)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The number of seconds between TCP keep-alive probes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_keepalive_probes</em> (integer; default: 9; since Linux 2.2)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum number of TCP keep-alive probes to send before giving up and killing the connection if no response is obtained from the other end.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_keepalive_time</em> (integer; default: 7200; since Linux 2.2)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The number of seconds a connection needs to be idle before TCP begins sending out keep-alive probes. Keep-alives are sent only when the <strong>SO_KEEPALIVE</strong> socket option is enabled. The default value is 7200 seconds (2 hours). An idle connection is terminated after approximately an additional 11 minutes (9 probes an interval of 75 seconds apart) when keep-alive is enabled.</p><p>Note that underlying connection tracking mechanisms and application timeouts may be much shorter.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_low_latency</em> (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.4.21/2.6)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If enabled, the TCP stack makes decisions that prefer lower latency as opposed to higher throughput. It this option is disabled, then higher throughput is preferred. An example of an application where this default should be changed would be a Beowulf compute cluster.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_max_orphans</em> (integer; default: see below; since Linux 2.4)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum number of orphaned (not attached to any user file handle) TCP sockets allowed in the system. When this number is exceeded, the orphaned connection is reset and a warning is printed. This limit exists only to prevent simple denial-of-service attacks. Lowering this limit is not recommended. Network conditions might require you to increase the number of orphans allowed, but note that each orphan can eat up to ~64K of unswappable memory. The default initial value is set equal to the kernel parameter NR_FILE. This initial default is adjusted depending on the memory in the system.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>tcp_max_syn_backlog</em> (integer; default: see below; since Linux 2.2)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>

<h3>Sockets API</h3>
<p>TCP provides limited support for out-of-band data, in the form of (a single byte of) urgent data. In Linux this means if the other end sends newer out-of-band data the older urgent data is inserted as normal data into the stream (even when <strong>SO_OOBINLINE</strong> is not set). This differs from BSD-based stacks.</p><p>Linux uses the BSD compatible interpretation of the urgent pointer field by default. This violates RFC&nbsp;1122, but is required for interoperability with other stacks. It can be changed via <em>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_stdurg</em>.</p><p>It is possible to peek at out-of-band data using the <a href="../man2/recv.2.html"><strong>recv</strong>(2)</a> <strong>MSG_PEEK</strong> flag.</p><p>Since version 2.4, Linux supports the use of <strong>MSG_TRUNC</strong> in the <em>flags</em> argument of <a href="../man2/recv.2.html"><strong>recv</strong>(2)</a> (and <a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html"><strong>recvmsg</strong>(2)</a>). This flag causes the received bytes of data to be discarded, rather than passed back in a caller-supplied buffer. Since Linux 2.4.4, <strong>MSG_TRUNC</strong> also has this effect when used in conjunction with <strong>MSG_OOB</strong> to receive out-of-band data.</p>

    <p>Returns true (i.e., <em>value</em> is nonzero) if the inbound data stream is at the urgent mark.</p><p>If the <strong>SO_OOBINLINE</strong> socket option is set, and <strong>SIOCATMARK</strong> returns true, then the next read from the socket will return the urgent data. If the <strong>SO_OOBINLINE</strong> socket option is not set, and <strong>SIOCATMARK</strong> returns true, then the next read from the socket will return the bytes following the urgent data (to actually read the urgent data requires the <strong>recv(MSG_OOB)</strong> flag).</p><p>Note that a read never reads across the urgent mark. If an application is informed of the presence of urgent data via <a href="../man2/select.2.html"><strong>select</strong>(2)</a> (using the <em>exceptfds</em> argument) or through delivery of a <strong>SIGURG</strong> signal, then it can advance up to the mark using a loop which repeatedly tests <strong>SIOCATMARK</strong> and performs a read (requesting any number of bytes) as long as <strong>SIOCATMARK</strong> returns false.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>SIOCOUTQ</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Returns the amount of unsent data in the socket send queue. The socket must not be in LISTEN state, otherwise an error (<strong>EINVAL</strong>) is returned. <strong>SIOCOUTQ</strong> is defined in <em>&lt;linux/sockios.h&gt;</em>. Alternatively, you can use the synonymous <strong>TIOCOUTQ</strong>, defined in <em>&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</em>.</p>

<h3>Error handling</h3>
<p>When a network error occurs, TCP tries to resend the packet. If it doesn't succeed after some time, either <strong>ETIMEDOUT</strong> or the last received error on this connection is reported.</p><p>Some applications require a quicker error notification. This can be enabled with the <strong>IPPROTO_IP</strong> level <strong>IP_RECVERR</strong> socket option. When this option is enabled, all incoming errors are immediately passed to the user program. Use this option with care &ndash; it makes TCP less tolerant to routing changes and other normal network conditions.</p>
