      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>dnsmasq</strong> is a lightweight DNS, TFTP, PXE, router advertisement and DHCP server. It is intended to provide coupled DNS and DHCP service to a LAN.</p><p>Dnsmasq accepts DNS queries and either answers them from a small, local, cache or forwards them to a real, recursive, DNS server. It loads the contents of /etc/hosts so that local hostnames which do not appear in the global DNS can be resolved and also answers DNS queries for DHCP configured hosts. It can also act as the authoritative DNS server for one or more domains, allowing local names to appear in the global DNS. It can be configured to do DNSSEC validation.</p><p>The dnsmasq DHCP server supports static address assignments and multiple networks. It automatically sends a sensible default set of DHCP options, and can be configured to send any desired set of DHCP options, including vendor-encapsulated options. It includes a secure, read-only, TFTP server to allow net/PXE boot of DHCP hosts and also supports BOOTP. The PXE support is full featured, and includes a proxy mode which supplies PXE information to clients whilst DHCP address allocation is done by another server.</p><p>The dnsmasq DHCPv6 server provides the same set of features as the DHCPv4 server, and in addition, it includes router advertisements and a neat feature which allows nameing for clients which use DHCPv4 and stateless autoconfiguration only for IPv6 configuration. There is support for doing address allocation (both DHCPv6 and RA) from subnets which are dynamically delegated via DHCPv6 prefix delegation.</p><p>Dnsmasq is coded with small embedded systems in mind. It aims for the smallest possible memory footprint compatible with the supported functions,  and allows uneeded functions to be omitted from the compiled binary.</p>
        </div>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Note that in general missing parameters are allowed and switch off functions, for instance "--pid-file" disables writing a PID file. On BSD, unless the GNU getopt library is linked, the long form of the options does not work on the command line; it is still recognised in the configuration file.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--test</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Read and syntax check configuration file(s). Exit with code 0 if all is OK, or a non-zero code otherwise. Do not start up dnsmasq.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-h, --no-hosts</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Don't read the hostnames in /etc/hosts.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-H, --addn-hosts=&lt;file&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Additional hosts file. Read the specified file as well as /etc/hosts. If -h is given, read only the specified file. This option may be repeated for more than one additional hosts file. If a directory is given, then read all the files contained in that directory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-E, --expand-hosts</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Add the domain to simple names (without a period) in /etc/hosts in the same way as for DHCP-derived names. Note that this does not apply to domain names in cnames, PTR records, TXT records etc.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-T, --local-ttl=&lt;time&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When replying with information from /etc/hosts or the DHCP leases file dnsmasq by default sets the time-to-live field to zero, meaning that the requester should not itself cache the information. This is the correct thing to do in almost all situations. This option allows a time-to-live (in seconds) to be given for these replies. This will reduce the load on the server at the expense of clients using stale data under some circumstances.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--neg-ttl=&lt;time&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Negative replies from upstream servers normally contain time-to-live information in SOA records which dnsmasq uses for caching. If the replies from upstream servers omit this information, dnsmasq does not cache the reply. This option gives a default value for time-to-live (in seconds) which dnsmasq uses to cache negative replies even in the absence of an SOA record.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--max-ttl=&lt;time&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set a maximum TTL value that will be handed out to clients. The specified maximum TTL will be given to clients instead of the true TTL value if it is lower. The true TTL value is however kept in the cache to avoid flooding the upstream DNS servers.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--max-cache-ttl=&lt;time&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set a maximum TTL value for entries in the cache.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--auth-ttl=&lt;time&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the TTL value returned in answers from the authoritative server.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-k, --keep-in-foreground</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Do not go into the background at startup but otherwise run as normal. This is intended for use when dnsmasq is run under daemontools or launchd.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-d, --no-daemon</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Debug mode: don't fork to the background, don't write a pid file, don't change user id, generate a complete cache dump on receipt on SIGUSR1, log to stderr as well as syslog, don't fork new processes to handle TCP queries. Note that this option is for use in debugging only, to stop dnsmasq daemonising in production, use <strong>-k.</strong></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-q, --log-queries</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Log the results of DNS queries handled by dnsmasq. Enable a full cache dump on receipt of SIGUSR1.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-8, --log-facility=&lt;facility&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the facility to which dnsmasq will send syslog entries, this defaults to DAEMON, and to LOCAL0 when debug mode is in operation. If the facility given contains at least one '/' character, it is taken to be a filename, and dnsmasq logs to the given file, instead of syslog. If the facility is '-' then dnsmasq logs to stderr. (Errors whilst reading configuration will still go to syslog, but all output from a successful startup, and all output whilst running, will go exclusively to the file.) When logging to a file, dnsmasq will close and reopen the file when it receives SIGUSR2. This allows the log file to be rotated without stopping dnsmasq.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--log-async[=&lt;lines&gt;]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable asynchronous logging and optionally set the limit on the number of lines which will be queued by dnsmasq when writing to the syslog is slow. Dnsmasq can log asynchronously: this allows it to continue functioning without being blocked by syslog, and allows syslog to use dnsmasq for DNS queries without risking deadlock. If the queue of log-lines becomes full, dnsmasq will log the overflow, and the number of messages  lost. The default queue length is 5, a sane value would be 5-25, and a maximum limit of 100 is imposed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-x, --pid-file=&lt;path&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify an alternate path for dnsmasq to record its process-id in. Normally /var/run/dnsmasq.pid.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-u, --user=&lt;username&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify the userid to which dnsmasq will change after startup. Dnsmasq must normally be started as root, but it will drop root privileges after startup by changing id to another user. Normally this user is "nobody" but that can be over-ridden with this switch.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-g, --group=&lt;groupname&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify the group which dnsmasq will run as. The defaults to "dip", if available, to facilitate access to /etc/ppp/resolv.conf which is not normally world readable.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-v, --version</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Print the version number.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-p, --port=&lt;port&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Listen on &lt;port&gt; instead of the standard DNS port (53). Setting this to zero completely disables DNS function, leaving only DHCP and/or TFTP.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-P, --edns-packet-max=&lt;size&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify the largest EDNS.0 UDP packet which is supported by the DNS forwarder. Defaults to 4096, which is the RFC5625-recommended size.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-Q, --query-port=&lt;query_port&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Send outbound DNS queries from, and listen for their replies on, the specific UDP port &lt;query_port&gt; instead of using random ports. NOTE that using this option will make dnsmasq less secure against DNS spoofing attacks but it may be faster and use less resources.  Setting this option to zero makes dnsmasq use a single port allocated to it by the OS: this was the default behaviour in versions prior to 2.43.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--min-port=&lt;port&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Do not use ports less than that given as source for outbound DNS queries. Dnsmasq picks random ports as source for outbound queries: when this option is given, the ports used will always to larger than that specified. Useful for systems behind firewalls.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-i, --interface=&lt;interface name&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Listen only on the specified interface(s). Dnsmasq automatically adds the loopback (local) interface to the list of interfaces to use when the <strong>--interface</strong> option  is used. If no <strong>--interface</strong> or <strong>--listen-address</strong> options are given dnsmasq listens on all available interfaces except any given in <strong>--except-interface</strong> options. IP alias interfaces (eg "eth1:0") cannot be used with <strong>--interface</strong> or <strong>--except-interface</strong> options, use --listen-address instead. A simple wildcard, consisting of a trailing '*', can be used in <strong>--interface</strong> and <strong>--except-interface</strong> options.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-I, --except-interface=&lt;interface name&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Do not listen on the specified interface. Note that the order of <strong>--listen-address</strong> <strong>--interface</strong> and <strong>--except-interface</strong> options does not matter and that <strong>--except-interface</strong> options always override the others.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--auth-server=&lt;domain&gt;,&lt;interface&gt;|&lt;ip-address&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable DNS authoritative mode for queries arriving at an interface or address. Note that the interface or address need not be mentioned in <strong>--interface</strong> or <strong>--listen-address</strong> configuration, indeed <strong>--auth-server</strong> will overide these and provide a different DNS service on the specified interface. The &lt;domain&gt; is the "glue record". It should resolve in the global DNS to a A and/or AAAA record which points to the address dnsmasq is listening on. When an interface is specified, it may be qualified with "/4" or "/6" to specify only the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses associated with the interface.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--local-service</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Accept DNS queries only from hosts whose address is on a local subnet, ie a subnet for which an interface exists on the server. This option only has effect is there are no --interface --except-interface, --listen-address or --auth-server options. It is intended to be set as a default on installation, to allow unconfigured installations to be useful but also safe from being used for DNS amplification attacks.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-2, --no-dhcp-interface=&lt;interface name&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Do not provide DHCP or TFTP on the specified interface, but do provide DNS service.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-a, --listen-address=&lt;ipaddr&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Listen on the given IP address(es). Both <strong>--interface</strong> and <strong>--listen-address</strong> options may be given, in which case the set of both interfaces and addresses is used. Note that if no <strong>--interface</strong> option is given, but <strong>--listen-address</strong> is, dnsmasq will not automatically listen on the loopback interface. To achieve this, its IP address, 127.0.0.1, must be explicitly given as a <strong>--listen-address</strong> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-z, --bind-interfaces</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard address, even when it is listening on only some interfaces. It then discards requests that it shouldn't reply to. This has the advantage of working even when interfaces come and go and change address. This option forces dnsmasq to really bind only the interfaces it is listening on. About the only time when this is useful is when running another nameserver (or another instance of dnsmasq) on the same machine. Setting this option also enables multiple instances of dnsmasq which provide DHCP service to run in the same machine.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--bind-dynamic</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable a network mode which is a hybrid between <strong>--bind-interfaces</strong> and the default. Dnsmasq binds the address of individual interfaces, allowing multiple dnsmasq instances, but if new interfaces or addresses appear, it automatically listens on those (subject to any access-control configuration). This makes dynamically created interfaces work in the same way as the default. Implementing this option requires non-standard networking APIs and it is only available under Linux. On other platforms it falls-back to --bind-interfaces mode.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-y, --localise-queries</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Return answers to DNS queries from /etc/hosts which depend on the interface over which the query was received. If a name in /etc/hosts has more than one address associated with it, and at least one of those addresses is on the same subnet as the interface to which the query was sent, then return only the address(es) on that subnet. This allows for a server  to have multiple addresses in /etc/hosts corresponding to each of its interfaces, and hosts will get the correct address based on which network they are attached to. Currently this facility is limited to IPv4.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-b, --bogus-priv</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Bogus private reverse lookups. All reverse lookups for private IP ranges (ie 192.168.x.x, etc) which are not found in /etc/hosts or the DHCP leases file are answered with "no such domain" rather than being forwarded upstream.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-V, --alias=[&lt;old-ip&gt;]|[&lt;start-ip&gt;-&lt;end-ip&gt;],&lt;new-ip&gt;[,&lt;mask&gt;]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Modify IPv4 addresses returned from upstream nameservers; old-ip is replaced by new-ip. If the optional mask is given then any address which matches the masked old-ip will be re-written. So, for instance <strong>--alias=1.2.3.0,6.7.8.0,255.255.255.0</strong> will map 1.2.3.56 to 6.7.8.56 and 1.2.3.67 to 6.7.8.67. This is what Cisco PIX routers call "DNS doctoring". If the old IP is given as range, then only addresses in the range, rather than a whole subnet, are re-written. So <strong>--alias=192.168.0.10-192.168.0.40,10.0.0.0,255.255.255.0</strong> maps 192.168.0.10-&gt;192.168.0.40 to 10.0.0.10-&gt;10.0.0.40</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-B, --bogus-nxdomain=&lt;ipaddr&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Transform replies which contain the IP address given into "No such domain" replies. This is intended to counteract a devious move made by Verisign in September 2003 when they started returning the address of an advertising web page in response to queries for unregistered names, instead of the correct NXDOMAIN response. This option tells dnsmasq to fake the correct response when it sees this behaviour. As at Sept 2003 the IP address being returned by Verisign is 64.94.110.11</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-f, --filterwin2k</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Later versions of windows make periodic DNS requests which don't get sensible answers from the public DNS and can cause problems by triggering dial-on-demand links. This flag turns on an option to filter such requests. The requests blocked are for records of types SOA and SRV, and type ANY where the requested name has underscores, to catch LDAP requests.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-r, --resolv-file=&lt;file&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Read the IP addresses of the upstream nameservers from &lt;file&gt;, instead of /etc/resolv.conf. For the format of this file see <a href="../man5/resolv.conf.5.html"><strong>resolv.conf</strong>(5)</a>. The only lines relevant to dnsmasq are nameserver ones. Dnsmasq can be told to poll more than one resolv.conf file, the first file name  specified overrides the default, subsequent ones add to the list. This is only allowed when polling; the file with the currently latest modification time is the one used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-R, --no-resolv</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Don't read /etc/resolv.conf. Get upstream servers only from the command line or the dnsmasq configuration file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-1, --enable-dbus[=&lt;service-name&gt;]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Allow dnsmasq configuration to be updated via DBus method calls. The configuration which can be changed is upstream DNS servers (and corresponding domains) and cache clear. Requires that dnsmasq has been built with DBus support. If the service name is given, dnsmasq provides service at that name, rather than the default which is <strong>uk.org.thekelleys.dnsmasq</strong></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-o, --strict-order</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>By default, dnsmasq will send queries to any of the upstream servers it knows about and tries to favour servers that are known to be up. Setting this flag forces dnsmasq to try each query with each server strictly in the order they appear in /etc/resolv.conf</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--all-servers</strong></p>

    <p>By default, when dnsmasq has more than one upstream server available, it will send queries to just one server. Setting this flag forces dnsmasq to send all queries to all available servers. The reply from the server which answers first will be returned to the original requester.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Enable code to detect DNS forwarding loops; ie the situation where a query sent to one of the upstream server eventually returns as a new query to the dnsmasq instance. The process works by generating TXT queries of the form &lt;hex&gt;.test and sending them to each upstream server. The hex is a UID which encodes the instance of dnsmasq sending the query and the upstream server to which it was sent. If the query returns to the server which sent it, then the upstream server through which it was sent is disabled and this event is logged. Each time the set of upstream servers changes, the test is re-run on all of them, including ones which were previously disabled.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Specify IP address of upstream servers directly. Setting this flag does not suppress reading of /etc/resolv.conf, use -R to do that. If one or more optional domains are given, that server is used only for those domains and they are queried only using the specified server. This is intended for private nameservers: if you have a nameserver on your network which deals with names of the form xxx.internal.thekelleys.org.uk at 192.168.1.1 then giving  the flag <strong>-S /internal.thekelleys.org.uk/192.168.1.1</strong> will send all queries for internal machines to that nameserver, everything else will go to the servers in /etc/resolv.conf. An empty domain specification, <strong>//</strong> has the special meaning of "unqualified names only" ie names without any dots in them. A non-standard port may be specified as part of the IP address using a # character. More than one -S flag is allowed, with repeated domain or ipaddr parts as required.</p><p>More specific domains take precendence over less specific domains, so: <strong>--server=/google.com/1.2.3.4</strong> <strong>--server=/www.google.com/2.3.4.5</strong> will send queries for *.google.com to 1.2.3.4, except *www.google.com, which will go to 2.3.4.5</p><p>The special server address '#' means, "use the standard servers", so <strong>--server=/google.com/1.2.3.4</strong> <strong>--server=/www.google.com/#</strong> will send queries for *.google.com to 1.2.3.4, except *www.google.com which will be forwarded as usual.</p><p>Also permitted is a -S flag which gives a domain but no IP address; this tells dnsmasq that a domain is local and it may answer queries from /etc/hosts or DHCP but should never forward queries on that domain to any upstream servers. <strong>local</strong> is a synonym for <strong>server</strong> to make configuration files clearer in this case.</p><p>IPv6 addresses may include a %interface scope-id, eg fe80::202:a412:4512:7bbf%eth0.</p><p>The optional string after the @ character tells dnsmasq how to set the source of the queries to this nameserver. It should be an ip-address, which should belong to the machine on which dnsmasq is running otherwise this server line will be logged and then ignored, or an interface name. If an interface name is given, then queries to the server will be forced via that interface; if an ip-address is given then the source address of the queries will be set to that address. The query-port flag is ignored for any servers which have a source address specified but the port may be specified directly as part of the source address. Forcing queries to an interface is not implemented on all platforms supported by dnsmasq.</p>

    <p>This is functionally the same as <strong>--server,</strong> but provides some syntactic sugar to make specifying address-to-name queries easier. For example <strong>--rev-server=1.2.3.0/24,192.168.0.1</strong> is exactly equivalent to <strong>--server=/3.2.1.in-addr.arpa/192.168.0.1</strong></p>

  <dd>
    <p>Specify an IP address to return for any host in the given domains. Queries in the domains are never forwarded and always replied to with the specified IP address which may be IPv4 or IPv6. To give both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for a domain, use repeated -A flags. Note that /etc/hosts and DHCP leases override this for individual names. A common use of this is to redirect the entire doubleclick.net domain to some friendly local web server to avoid banner ads. The domain specification works in the same was as for --server, with the additional facility that /#/ matches any domain. Thus --address=/#/1.2.3.4 will always return 1.2.3.4 for any query not answered from /etc/hosts or DHCP and not sent to an upstream nameserver by a more specific --server directive.</p>

    <p>Add A, AAAA and PTR records to the DNS. This adds one or more names to the DNS with associated IPv4 (A) and IPv6 (AAAA) records. A name may appear in more than one <strong>host-record</strong> and therefore be assigned more than one address. Only the first address creates a PTR record linking the address to the name. This is the same rule as is used reading hosts-files. <strong>host-record</strong> options are considered to be read before host-files, so a name appearing there inhibits PTR-record creation if it appears in hosts-file also. Unlike hosts-files, names are not expanded, even when <strong>expand-hosts</strong> is in effect. Short and long names may appear in the same <strong>host-record,</strong> eg. <strong>--host-record=laptop,laptop.thekelleys.org,192.168.0.1,1234::100</strong></p>

There are significant limitations on the target; it must be a DNS name which is known to dnsmasq from /etc/hosts (or additional hosts files), from DHCP, from --interface-name or from another <strong>--cname.</strong> If the target does not satisfy this criteria, the whole cname is ignored. The cname must be unique, but it is permissable to have more than one cname pointing to the same target.</p>

    <p>Return a DNS record associating the name with the primary address on the given interface. This flag specifies an A or AAAA record for the given name in the same way as an /etc/hosts line, except that the address is not constant, but taken from the given interface. The interface may be followed by "/4" or "/6" to specify that only IPv4 or IPv6 addresses of the interface should be used. If the interface is down, not configured or non-existent, an empty record is returned. The matching PTR record is also created, mapping the interface address to the name. More than one name may be associated with an interface address by repeating the flag; in that case the first instance is used for the reverse address-to-name mapping.</p>

The same applies to IPv6, but IPv6 addresses may start with '::' but DNS labels may not start with '-' so in this case if no prefix is configured a zero is added in front of the label. ::1 becomes 0--1.</p><p>The address range can be of the form &lt;ip address&gt;,&lt;ip address&gt; or &lt;ip address&gt;/&lt;netmask&gt;</p>

    <p>Add the MAC address of the requestor to DNS queries which are forwarded upstream. This may be used to DNS filtering by the upstream server. The MAC address can only be added if the requestor is on the same subnet as the dnsmasq server. Note that the mechanism used to achieve this (an EDNS0 option) is not yet standardised, so this should be considered experimental. Also note that exposing MAC addresses in this way may have security and privacy implications. The warning about caching given for --add-subnet applies to --add-mac too.</p>

    <p>Add the subnet address of the requestor to the DNS queries which are forwarded upstream. The amount of the address forwarded depends on the prefix length parameter: 32 (128 for IPv6) forwards the whole address, zero forwards none of it but still marks the request so that no upstream nameserver will add client address information either. The default is zero for both IPv4 and IPv6. Note that upstream nameservers may be configured to return different results based on this information, but the dnsmasq cache does not take account. If a dnsmasq instance is configured such that different results may be encountered, caching should be disabled.</p>

    <p>Set the maximum number of concurrent DNS queries. The default value is 150, which should be fine for most setups. The only known situation where this needs to be increased is when using web-server log file resolvers, which can generate large numbers of concurrent queries.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--dnssec</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Validate DNS replies and cache DNSSEC data. When forwarding DNS queries, dnsmasq requests the DNSSEC records needed to validate the replies. The replies are validated and the result returned as the Authenticated Data bit in the DNS packet. In addition the DNSSEC records are stored in the cache, making validation by clients more efficient. Note that validation by clients is the most secure DNSSEC mode, but for clients unable to do validation, use of the AD bit set by dnsmasq is useful, provided that the network between the dnsmasq server and the client is trusted. Dnsmasq must be compiled with HAVE_DNSSEC enabled, and DNSSEC trust anchors provided, see <strong>--trust-anchor.</strong> Because the DNSSEC validation process uses the cache, it is not permitted to reduce the cache size below the default when DNSSEC is enabled. The nameservers upstream of dnsmasq must be DNSSEC-capable, ie capable of returning DNSSEC records with data. If they are not, then dnsmasq will not be able to determine the trusted status of answers. In the default mode, this menas that all replies will be marked as untrusted. If <strong>--dnssec-check-unsigned</strong> is set and the upstream servers don't support DNSSEC, then DNS service will be entirely broken.</p>

    <p>Provide DS records to act a trust anchors for DNSSEC validation.

    <p><strong>--dnssec-check-unsigned</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>As a default, dnsmasq does not check that unsigned DNS replies are legitimate: they are assumed to be valid and passed on (without the "authentic data" bit set, of course). This does not protect against an attacker forging unsigned replies for signed DNS zones, but it is fast. If this flag is set, dnsmasq will check the zones of unsigned replies, to ensure that unsigned replies are allowed in those zones. The cost of this is more upstream queries and slower performance. See also the warning about upstream servers in the section on <strong>--dnssec</strong></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--dnssec-no-timecheck</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>DNSSEC signatures are only valid for specified time windows, and should be rejected outside those windows. This generates an interesting chicken-and-egg problem for machines which don't have a hardware real time clock. For these machines to determine the correct time typically requires use of NTP and therefore DNS, but validating DNS requires that the correct time is already known. Setting this flag removes the time-window checks (but not other DNSSEC validation.) only until the dnsmasq process receives SIGHUP. The intention is that dnsmasq should be started with this flag when the platform determines that reliable time is not currently available. As soon as reliable time is established, a SIGHUP should be sent to dnsmasq, which enables time checking, and purges the cache of DNS records which have not been throughly checked.</p>

    <p>Define a DNS zone for which dnsmasq acts as authoritative server. Locally defined DNS records which are in the domain will be served. If subnet(s) are given, A and AAAA records must be in one of the specified subnets.</p><p>As alternative to directly specifying the subnets, it's possible to give the name of an interface, in which case the subnets implied by that interface's configured addresses and netmask/prefix-length are used; this is useful when using constructed DHCP ranges as the actual address is dynamic and not known when configuring dnsmasq. The interface addresses may be confined to only IPv6 addresses using &lt;interface&gt;/6 or to only IPv4 using &lt;interface&gt;/4. This is useful when an interface has dynamically determined global IPv6 addresses which should appear in the zone, but RFC1918 IPv4 addresses which should not. Interface-name and address-literal subnet specifications may be used freely in the same --auth-zone declaration.</p><p>The subnet(s) are also used to define in-addr.arpa and ip6.arpa domains which are served for reverse-DNS queries. If not specified, the prefix length defaults to 24 for IPv4 and 64 for IPv6. For IPv4 subnets, the prefix length should be have the value 8, 16 or 24 unless you are familiar with RFC 2317 and have arranged the in-addr.arpa delegation accordingly.

    <p>Enable the DHCP server. Addresses will be given out from the range &lt;start-addr&gt; to &lt;end-addr&gt; and from statically defined addresses given in <strong>dhcp-host</strong> options. If the lease time is given, then leases will be given for that length of time. The lease time is in seconds, or minutes (eg 45m) or hours (eg 1h) or "infinite". If not given, the default lease time is one hour. The minimum lease time is two minutes. For IPv6 ranges, the lease time maybe "deprecated"; this sets the preferred lifetime sent in a DHCP lease or router advertisement to zero, which causes clients to use other addresses, if available, for new connections as a prelude to renumbering.</p><p>This option may be repeated, with different addresses, to enable DHCP service to more than one network. For directly connected networks (ie, networks on which the machine running dnsmasq has an interface) the netmask is optional: dnsmasq will determine it from the interface configuration. For networks which receive DHCP service via a relay agent, dnsmasq cannot determine the netmask itself, so it should be specified, otherwise dnsmasq will have to guess, based on the class (A, B or C) of the network address. The broadcast address is always optional. It is always allowed to have more than one dhcp-range in a single subnet.</p><p>For IPv6, the parameters are slightly different: instead of netmask and broadcast address, there is an optional prefix length which must be equal to or larger then the prefix length on the local interface. If not given, this defaults to 64. Unlike the IPv4 case, the prefix length is not automatically derived from the interface configuration. The mimimum size of the prefix length is 64.</p><p>IPv6 (only) supports another type of range. In this, the start address and optional end address contain only the network part (ie ::1) and they are followed by <strong>constructor:&lt;interface&gt;.</strong> This forms a template which describes how to create ranges, based on the addresses assigned to the interface. For instance</p><p><strong>--dhcp-range=::1,::400,constructor:eth0</strong></p><p>will look for addresses on eth0 and then create a range from &lt;network&gt;::1 to &lt;network&gt;::400. If the interface is assigned more than one network, then the corresponding ranges will be automatically created, and then deprecated and finally removed again as the address is deprecated and then deleted. The interface name may have a final "*" wildcard. Note that just any address on eth0 will not do: it must not be an autoconfigured or privacy address, or be deprecated.</p><p>If a dhcp-range is only being used for stateless DHCP and/or SLAAC, then the address can be simply ::</p><p><strong>--dhcp-range=::,constructor:eth0</strong></p><p>The optional <strong>set:&lt;tag&gt;</strong> sets an alphanumeric label which marks this network so that dhcp options may be specified on a per-network basis. When it is prefixed with 'tag:' instead, then its meaning changes from setting a tag to matching it. Only one tag may be set, but more than one tag may be matched.</p><p>The optional &lt;mode&gt; keyword may be <strong>static</strong> which tells dnsmasq to enable DHCP for the network specified, but not to dynamically allocate IP addresses: only hosts which have static addresses given via <strong>dhcp-host</strong> or from /etc/ethers will be served. A static-only subnet with address all zeros may be used as a "catch-all" address to enable replies to all Information-request packets on a subnet which is provided with stateless DHCPv6, ie <strong>--dhcp-range=::,static</strong></p><p>For IPv4, the &lt;mode&gt; may be <strong>proxy</strong> in which case dnsmasq will provide proxy-DHCP on the specified subnet. (See <strong>pxe-prompt</strong> and <strong>pxe-service</strong> for details.)</p><p>For IPv6, the mode may be some combination of <strong>ra-only, slaac, ra-names, ra-stateless, ra-advrouter.</strong></p><p><strong>ra-only</strong> tells dnsmasq to offer Router Advertisement only on this subnet, and not DHCP.</p><p><strong>slaac</strong> tells dnsmasq to offer Router Advertisement on this subnet and to set the A bit in the router advertisement, so that the client will use SLAAC addresses. When used with a DHCP range or static DHCP address this results in the client having both a DHCP-assigned and a SLAAC address.</p><p><strong>ra-stateless</strong> sends router advertisements with the O and A bits set, and provides a stateless DHCP service. The client will use a SLAAC address, and use DHCP for other configuration information.</p><p><strong>ra-names</strong> enables a mode which gives DNS names to dual-stack hosts which do SLAAC for IPv6. Dnsmasq uses the host's IPv4 lease to derive the name, network segment and MAC address and assumes that the host will also have an IPv6 address calculated using the SLAAC algorithm, on the same network segment. The address is pinged, and if a reply is received, an AAAA record is added to the DNS for this IPv6 address. Note that this is only happens for directly-connected networks, (not one doing DHCP via a relay) and it will not work if a host is using privacy extensions. <strong>ra-names</strong> can be combined  with <strong>ra-stateless</strong> and <strong>slaac.</strong></p><p><strong>ra-advrouter</strong> enables a mode where router address(es) rather than prefix(es) are included in the advertisements. This is described in RFC-3775 section 7.2 and is used in mobile IPv6. In this mode the interval option is also included, as described in RFC-3775 section 7.3.</p>

    <p>Specify per host parameters for the DHCP server. This allows a machine with a particular hardware address to be always allocated the same hostname, IP address and lease time. A hostname specified like this overrides any supplied by the DHCP client on the machine. It is also allowable to omit the hardware address and include the hostname, in which case the IP address and lease times will apply to any machine claiming that name. For example <strong>--dhcp-host=00:20:e0:3b:13:af,wap,infinite</strong> tells dnsmasq to give the machine with hardware address 00:20:e0:3b:13:af the name wap, and an infinite DHCP lease. <strong>--dhcp-host=lap,192.168.0.199</strong> tells dnsmasq to always allocate the machine lap the IP address 192.168.0.199.</p><p>Addresses allocated like this are not constrained to be in the range given by the --dhcp-range option, but they must be in the same subnet as some valid dhcp-range.  For subnets which don't need a pool of dynamically allocated addresses, use the "static" keyword in the dhcp-range declaration.</p><p>It is allowed to use client identifiers (called client DUID in IPv6-land rather than hardware addresses to identify hosts by prefixing with 'id:'. Thus: <strong>--dhcp-host=id:01:02:03:04,.....</strong> refers to the host with client identifier 01:02:03:04. It is also allowed to specify the client ID as text, like this: <strong>--dhcp-host=id:clientidastext,.....</strong></p><p>A single <strong>dhcp-host</strong> may contain an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address, or both. IPv6 addresses must be bracketed by square brackets thus: <strong>--dhcp-host=laptop,[1234::56]</strong> IPv6 addresses may contain only the host-identifier part: <strong>--dhcp-host=laptop,[::56]</strong> in which case they act as wildcards in constructed dhcp ranges, with the appropriate network part inserted. Note that in IPv6 DHCP, the hardware address may not be available, though it normally is for direct-connected clients, or clients using DHCP relays which support RFC 6939.</p><p>For DHCPv4, the  special option id:* means "ignore any client-id and use MAC addresses only." This is useful when a client presents a client-id sometimes but not others.</p><p>If a name appears in /etc/hosts, the associated address can be allocated to a DHCP lease, but only if a <strong>--dhcp-host</strong> option specifying the name also exists. Only one hostname can be given in a <strong>dhcp-host</strong> option, but aliases are possible by using CNAMEs. (See <strong>--cname</strong> ).</p><p>The special keyword "ignore" tells dnsmasq to never offer a DHCP lease to a machine. The machine can be specified by hardware address, client ID or hostname, for instance <strong>--dhcp-host=00:20:e0:3b:13:af,ignore</strong> This is useful when there is another DHCP server on the network which should be used by some machines.</p><p>The set:&lt;tag&gt; construct sets the tag whenever this dhcp-host directive is in use. This can be used to selectively send DHCP options just for this host. More than one tag can be set in a dhcp-host directive (but not in other places where "set:&lt;tag&gt;" is allowed). When a host matches any dhcp-host directive (or one implied by /etc/ethers) then the special tag "known" is set. This allows dnsmasq to be configured to ignore requests from unknown machines using <strong>--dhcp-ignore=tag:!known</strong> Ethernet addresses (but not client-ids) may have wildcard bytes, so for example <strong>--dhcp-host=00:20:e0:3b:13:*,ignore</strong> will cause dnsmasq to ignore a range of hardware addresses. Note that the "*" will need to be escaped or quoted on a command line, but not in the configuration file.</p><p>Hardware addresses normally match any network (ARP) type, but it is possible to restrict them to a single ARP type by preceding them with the ARP-type (in HEX) and "-". so <strong>--dhcp-host=06-00:20:e0:3b:13:af,1.2.3.4</strong> will only match a Token-Ring hardware address, since the ARP-address type for token ring is 6.</p><p>As a special case, in DHCPv4, it is possible to include more than one hardware address. eg: <strong>--dhcp-host=11:22:33:44:55:66,12:34:56:78:90:12,192.168.0.2</strong> This allows an IP address to be associated with multiple hardware addresses, and gives dnsmasq permission to abandon a DHCP lease to one of the hardware addresses when another one asks for a lease. Beware that this is a dangerous thing to do, it will only work reliably if only one of the hardware addresses is active at any time and there is no way for dnsmasq to enforce this. It is, for instance, useful to allocate a stable IP address to a laptop which has both wired and wireless interfaces.</p>

Note that it is possible to encode the information in a <strong>--dhcp-boot</strong> flag as DHCP options, using the options names bootfile-name, server-ip-address and tftp-server.

    <p>Specify different or extra options to DHCP clients. By default, dnsmasq sends some standard options to DHCP clients, the netmask and broadcast address are set to the same as the host running dnsmasq, and the DNS server and default route are set to the address of the machine running dnsmasq. (Equivalent rules apply for IPv6.) If the domain name option has been set, that is sent. This configuration allows these defaults to be overridden, or other options specified. The option, to be sent may be given as a decimal number or as "option:&lt;option-name&gt;" The option numbers are specified in RFC2132 and subsequent RFCs. The set of option-names known by dnsmasq can be discovered by running "dnsmasq --help dhcp". For example, to set the default route option to 192.168.4.4, do <strong>--dhcp-option=3,192.168.4.4</strong> or <strong>--dhcp-option = option:router, 192.168.4.4</strong> and to set the time-server address to 192.168.0.4, do <strong>--dhcp-option = 42,192.168.0.4</strong> or <strong>--dhcp-option = option:ntp-server, 192.168.0.4</strong> The special address 0.0.0.0 is taken to mean "the address of the machine running dnsmasq".</p><p>Data types allowed are comma separated dotted-quad IPv4 addresses, []-wrapped IPv6 addresses, a decimal number, colon-separated hex digits and a text string. If the optional tags are given then this option is only sent when all the tags are matched.</p><p>Special processing is done on a text argument for option 119, to conform with RFC 3397. Text or dotted-quad IP addresses as arguments to option 120 are handled as per RFC 3361. Dotted-quad IP addresses which are followed by a slash and then a netmask size are encoded as described in RFC 3442.</p><p>IPv6 options are specified using the <strong>option6:</strong> keyword, followed by the option number or option name. The IPv6 option name space is disjoint from the IPv4 option name space. IPv6 addresses in options must be bracketed with square brackets, eg. <strong>--dhcp-option=option6:ntp-server,[1234::56]</strong> For IPv6, [::] means "the global address of the machine running dnsmasq", whilst [fd00::] is replaced with the ULA, if it exists, and [fe80::] with the link-local address.</p><p>Be careful: no checking is done that the correct type of data for the option number is sent, it is quite possible to persuade dnsmasq to generate illegal DHCP packets with injudicious use of this flag. When the value is a decimal number, dnsmasq must determine how large the data item is. It does this by examining the option number and/or the value, but can be overridden by appending a single letter flag as follows: b = one byte, s = two bytes, i = four bytes. This is mainly useful with encapsulated vendor class options (see below) where dnsmasq cannot determine data size from the  option number. Option data which consists solely of periods and digits will be interpreted by dnsmasq as an IP address, and inserted into an option as such. To force a literal string, use quotes. For instance when using option 66 to send a literal IP address as TFTP server name, it is necessary to do <strong>--dhcp-option=66,"1.2.3.4"</strong></p><p>Encapsulated Vendor-class options may also be specified (IPv4 only) using --dhcp-option: for instance <strong>--dhcp-option=vendor:PXEClient,1,0.0.0.0</strong> sends the encapsulated vendor class-specific option "mftp-address=0.0.0.0" to any client whose vendor-class matches "PXEClient". The vendor-class matching is substring based (see --dhcp-vendorclass for details). If a vendor-class option (number 60) is sent by dnsmasq, then that is used for selecting encapsulated options in preference to any sent by the client. It is possible to omit the vendorclass completely; <strong>--dhcp-option=vendor:,1,0.0.0.0</strong> in which case the encapsulated option is always sent.</p><p>Options may be encapsulated (IPv4 only) within other options: for instance <strong>--dhcp-option=encap:175, 190, iscsi-client0</strong> will send option 175, within which is the option 190. If multiple options are given which are encapsulated with the same option number then they will be correctly combined into one encapsulated option. encap: and vendor: are may not both be set in the same dhcp-option.</p><p>The final variant on encapsulated options is "Vendor-Identifying Vendor Options" as specified by RFC3925. These are denoted like this: <strong>--dhcp-option=vi-encap:2, 10, text</strong> The number in the vi-encap: section is the IANA enterprise number used to identify this option. This form of encapsulation is supported in IPv6.</p><p>The address 0.0.0.0 is not treated specially in encapsulated options.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This works in exactly the same way as <strong>--dhcp-option</strong> except that the option will always be sent, even if the client does not ask for it in the parameter request list. This is sometimes needed, for example when sending options to PXELinux.</p>

    <p>(IPv4 only) Disable re-use of the DHCP servername and filename fields as extra option space. If it can, dnsmasq moves the boot server and filename information (from dhcp-boot) out of their dedicated fields into DHCP options. This make extra space available in the DHCP packet for options but can, rarely, confuse old or broken clients. This flag forces "simple and safe" behaviour to avoid problems in such a case.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Configure dnsmasq to do DHCP relay. The local address is an address allocated to an interface on the host running dnsmasq. All DHCP requests arriving on that interface will we relayed to a remote DHCP server at the server address. It is possible to relay from a single local address to multiple remote servers by using multiple dhcp-relay configs with the same local address and different server addresses. A server address must be an IP literal address, not a domain name. In the case of DHCPv6, the server address may be the ALL_SERVERS multicast address, ff05::1:3. In this case the interface must be given, not be wildcard, and is used to direct the multicast to the correct interface to reach the DHCP server.</p><p>Access control for DHCP clients has the same rules as for the DHCP server, see --interface, --except-interface, etc. The optional interface name in the dhcp-relay config has a different function: it controls on which interface DHCP replies from the server will be accepted. This is intended for configurations which have three interfaces: one being relayed from, a second connecting the DHCP server, and a third untrusted network, typically the wider internet. It avoids the possibility of spoof replies arriving via this third interface.</p><p>It is allowed to have dnsmasq act as a DHCP server on one set of interfaces and relay from a disjoint set of interfaces. Note that whilst it is quite possible to write configurations which appear to act as a server and a relay on the same interface, this is not supported: the relay function will take precedence.</p><p>Both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 relay is supported. It's not possible to relay DHCPv4 to a DHCPv6 server or vice-versa.</p>

    <p>Map from a vendor-class string to a tag. Most DHCP clients provide a "vendor class" which represents, in some sense, the type of host. This option maps vendor classes to tags, so that DHCP options may be selectively delivered to different classes of hosts. For example <strong>dhcp-vendorclass=set:printers,Hewlett-Packard JetDirect</strong> will allow options to be set only for HP printers like so: <strong>--dhcp-option=tag:printers,3,192.168.4.4</strong> The vendor-class string is substring matched against the vendor-class supplied by the client, to allow fuzzy matching. The set: prefix is optional but allowed for consistency.</p><p>Note that in IPv6 only, vendorclasses are namespaced with an IANA-allocated enterprise number. This is given with enterprise: keyword and specifies that only vendorclasses matching the specified number should be searched.</p>

This is undesirable if the relay agent is adding extra information to the DHCP packets, such as that used by <strong>dhcp-circuitid</strong> and <strong>dhcp-remoteid.</strong> A full relay implementation can use the RFC 5107 serverid-override option to force the DHCP server to use the relay as a full proxy, with all packets passing through it. This flag provides an alternative method of doing the same thing, for relays which don't support RFC 5107. Given alone, it manipulates the server-id for all interactions via relays. If a list of IP addresses is given, only interactions via relays at those addresses are affected.</p>

    <p>Dnsmasq is designed to choose IP addresses for DHCP clients using a hash of the client's MAC address. This normally allows a client's address to remain stable long-term, even if the client  sometimes allows its DHCP lease to expire. In this default mode IP addresses are distributed pseudo-randomly over the entire available address range. There are sometimes circumstances (typically server deployment) where it is more convenient to have IP addresses allocated sequentially, starting from the lowest available address, and setting this flag enables this mode. Note that in the sequential mode, clients which allow a lease to expire are much more likely to move IP address; for this reason it should not be generally used.</p>

The known types are x86PC, PC98, IA64_EFI, Alpha, Arc_x86, Intel_Lean_Client, IA32_EFI, BC_EFI, Xscale_EFI and X86-64_EFI; an integer may be used for other types. The parameter after the menu text may be a file name, in which case dnsmasq acts as a boot server and directs the PXE client to download the file by TFTP, either from itself ( <strong>enable-tftp</strong> must be set for this to work) or another TFTP server if the final server address/name is given. Note that the "layer" suffix (normally ".0") is supplied by PXE, and should not be added to the basename. If an integer boot service type, rather than a basename is given, then the PXE client will search for a suitable boot service for that type on the network. This search may be done by broadcast, or direct to a server if its IP address/name is provided.

For DHCPv4, it changes the behaviour from strict RFC compliance so that DHCP requests on unknown leases from unknown hosts are not ignored. This allows new hosts to get a lease without a tedious timeout under all circumstances. It also allows dnsmasq to rebuild its lease database without each client needing to reacquire a lease, if the database is lost. For DHCPv6 it sets the priority in replies to 255 (the maximum) instead of 0 (the minimum).</p>

    <p>(IPv6 only) Specify the server persistent UID which the DHCPv6 server will use. This option is not normally required as dnsmasq creates a DUID automatically when it is first needed. When given, this option provides dnsmasq the data required to create a DUID-EN type DUID. Note that once set, the DUID is stored in the lease database, so to change between DUID-EN and automatically created DUIDs or vice-versa, the lease database must be re-intialised.

The arguments to the process are "add", "old" or "del", the MAC address of the host (or DUID for IPv6) , the IP address, and the hostname, if known. "add" means a lease has been created, "del" means it has been destroyed, "old" is a notification of an existing lease when dnsmasq starts or a change to MAC address or hostname of an existing lease (also, lease length or expiry and client-id, if leasefile-ro is set). If the MAC address is from a network type other than ethernet, it will have the network type prepended, eg "06-01:23:45:67:89:ab" for token ring. The process is run as root (assuming that dnsmasq was originally run as root) even if dnsmasq is configured to change UID to an unprivileged user.</p><p>The environment is inherited from the invoker of dnsmasq, with some or all of the following variables added</p><p>For both IPv4 and IPv6:</p><p>DNSMASQ_DOMAIN if the fully-qualified domain name of the host is known, this is set to the  domain part.

The number of seconds until lease expiry is always stored in DNSMASQ_TIME_REMAINING.</p><p>If a lease used to have a hostname, which is removed, an "old" event is generated with the new state of the lease, ie no name, and the former name is provided in the environment variable DNSMASQ_OLD_HOSTNAME.</p><p>DNSMASQ_INTERFACE stores the name of the interface on which the request arrived; this is not set for "old" actions when dnsmasq restarts.</p><p>DNSMASQ_RELAY_ADDRESS is set if the client used a DHCP relay to contact dnsmasq and the IP address of the relay is known.</p><p>DNSMASQ_TAGS contains all the tags set during the DHCP transaction, separated by spaces.</p><p>DNSMASQ_LOG_DHCP is set if <strong>--log-dhcp</strong> is in effect.</p><p>For IPv4 only:</p><p>DNSMASQ_CLIENT_ID if the host provided a client-id.</p><p>DNSMASQ_CIRCUIT_ID, DNSMASQ_SUBSCRIBER_ID, DNSMASQ_REMOTE_ID if a DHCP relay-agent added any of these options.</p><p>If the client provides vendor-class, DNSMASQ_VENDOR_CLASS.</p><p>For IPv6 only:</p><p>If the client provides vendor-class, DNSMASQ_VENDOR_CLASS_ID, containing the IANA enterprise id for the class, and DNSMASQ_VENDOR_CLASS0..DNSMASQ_VENDOR_CLASSn for the data.</p><p>DNSMASQ_SERVER_DUID containing the DUID of the server: this is the same for every call to the script.</p><p>DNSMASQ_IAID containing the IAID for the lease.

Changes to the lease database are which require the script to be invoked are queued awaiting exit of a running instance. If this queueing allows multiple state changes occur to a single lease before the script can be run then earlier states are discarded and the current state of that lease is reflected when the script finally runs.</p><p>At dnsmasq startup, the script will be invoked for all existing leases as they are read from the lease file. Expired leases will be called with "del" and others with "old". When dnsmasq receives a HUP signal, the script will be invoked for existing leases with an "old " event.</p><p>There are two further actions which may appear as the first argument to the script, "init" and "tftp". More may be added in the future, so scripts should be written to ignore unknown actions. "init" is described below in <strong>--leasefile-ro</strong> The "tftp" action is invoked when a TFTP file transfer completes: the arguments are the file size in bytes, the address to which the file was sent, and the complete pathname of the file.</p>

It may also provide a <strong>tftp</strong> function.</p><p>The <strong>lease</strong> function receives the information detailed in <strong>--dhcp-script.</strong> It gets two arguments, firstly the action, which is a string containing, "add", "old" or "del", and secondly a table of tag value pairs.

There are a few extra tags which hold the data supplied as arguments to <strong>--dhcp-script.</strong> These are <strong>mac_address, ip_address</strong> and <strong>hostname</strong> for IPv4, and <strong>client_duid, ip_address</strong> and <strong>hostname</strong> for IPv6.</p><p>The <strong>tftp</strong> function is called in the same way as the lease function, and the table holds the tags <strong>destination_address,</strong> <strong>file_name</strong> and <strong>file_size.</strong></p>

In addition to the invocations  given in <strong>--dhcp-script</strong> the lease-change script is called once, at dnsmasq startup, with the single argument "init". When called like this the script should write the saved state of the lease database, in dnsmasq leasefile format, to stdout and exit with zero exit code.

  <dd>
    <p>Specifies DNS domains for the DHCP server. Domains may be be given unconditionally (without the IP range) or for limited IP ranges. This has two effects; firstly it causes the DHCP server to return the domain to any hosts which request it, and secondly it sets the domain which it is legal for DHCP-configured hosts to claim. The intention is to constrain hostnames so that an untrusted host on the LAN cannot advertise its name via dhcp as e.g. "microsoft.com" and capture traffic not meant for it. If no domain suffix is specified, then any DHCP hostname with a domain part (ie with a period) will be disallowed and logged. If suffix is specified, then hostnames with a domain part are allowed, provided the domain part matches the suffix. In addition, when a suffix is set then hostnames without a domain part have the suffix added as an optional domain part. Eg on my network I can set <strong>--domain=thekelleys.org.uk</strong> and have a machine whose DHCP hostname is "laptop". The IP address for that machine is available from <strong>dnsmasq</strong> both as "laptop" and "laptop.thekelleys.org.uk". If the domain is given as "#" then the domain is read from the first "search" directive in /etc/resolv.conf (or equivalent).</p><p>The address range can be of the form &lt;ip address&gt;,&lt;ip address&gt; or &lt;ip address&gt;/&lt;netmask&gt; or just a single &lt;ip address&gt;. See <strong>--dhcp-fqdn</strong> which can change the behaviour of dnsmasq with domains.</p><p>If the address range is given as ip-address/network-size, then a additional flag "local" may be supplied which has the effect of adding --local declarations for forward and reverse DNS queries. Eg. <strong>--domain=thekelleys.org.uk,192.168.0.0/24,local</strong> is identical to <strong>--domain=thekelleys.org.uk,192.168.0.0/24</strong> --local=/thekelleys.org.uk/ --local=/0.168.192.in-addr.arpa/ The network size must be 8, 16 or 24 for this to be legal.</p>

    <p>In the default mode, dnsmasq inserts the unqualified names of DHCP clients into the DNS. For this reason, the names must be unique, even if two clients which have the same name are in different domains. If a second DHCP client appears which has the same name as an existing client, the name is transferred to the new client. If <strong>--dhcp-fqdn</strong> is set, this behaviour changes: the unqualified name is no longer put in the DNS, only the qualified name. Two DHCP clients with the same name may both keep the name, provided that the domain part is different (ie the fully qualified names differ.) To ensure that all names have a domain part, there must be at least <strong>--domain</strong> without an address specified when <strong>--dhcp-fqdn</strong> is set.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Normally, when giving a DHCP lease, dnsmasq sets flags in the FQDN option to tell the client not to attempt a DDNS update with its name and IP address. This is because the name-IP pair is automatically added into dnsmasq's DNS view. This flag suppresses that behaviour, this is useful, for instance, to allow Windows clients to update Active Directory servers. See RFC 4702 for details.</p>

    <p>Enable dnsmasq's IPv6 Router Advertisement feature. DHCPv6 doesn't handle complete network configuration in the same way as DHCPv4. Router discovery and (possibly) prefix discovery for autonomous address creation are handled by a different protocol. When DHCP is in use, only a subset of this is needed, and dnsmasq can handle it, using existing DHCP configuration to provide most data. When RA is enabled, dnsmasq will advertise a prefix for each dhcp-range, with default router and recursive DNS server as the relevant link-local address on the machine running dnsmasq. By default, he "managed address" bits are set, and the "use SLAAC" bit is reset. This can be changed for individual subnets with the mode keywords described in <strong>--dhcp-range.</strong> RFC6106 DNS parameters are included in the advertisements. By default, the relevant link-local address of the machine running dnsmasq is sent as recursive DNS server. If provided, the DHCPv6 options dns-server and domain-search are used for RDNSS and DNSSL.</p>

When the --tftp-secure flag is given, only files owned by the user running the dnsmasq process are accessible. If dnsmasq is being run as root, different rules apply: --tftp-secure has no effect, but only files which have the world-readable bit set are accessible. It is not recommended to run dnsmasq as root with TFTP enabled, and certainly not without specifying --tftp-root. Doing so can expose any world-readable file on the server to any host on the net.</p>

When serving a large number of TFTP connections, per-process file descriptor limits may be encountered. Dnsmasq needs one file descriptor for each concurrent TFTP connection and one file descriptor per unique file (plus a few others). So serving the same file simultaneously to n clients will use require about n + 10 file descriptors, serving different files simultaneously to n clients will require about (2*n) + 10 descriptors.

<p>When it receives a SIGHUP, <strong>dnsmasq</strong> clears its cache and then re-loads <em>/etc/hosts</em> and <em>/etc/ethers</em> and any file given by --dhcp-hostsfile, --dhcp-optsfile or --addn-hosts. The dhcp lease change script is called for all existing DHCP leases. If <strong></strong> --no-poll is set SIGHUP also re-reads <em>/etc/resolv.conf.</em> SIGHUP does NOT re-read the configuration file.</p><p>When it receives a SIGUSR1, <strong>dnsmasq</strong> writes statistics to the system log. It writes the cache size, the number of names which have had to removed from the cache before they expired in order to make room for new names and the total number of names that have been inserted into the cache. The number of cache hits and misses and the number of authoritative queries answered are also given. For each upstream server it gives the number of queries sent, and the number which resulted in an error. In <strong>--no-daemon</strong> mode or when full logging is enabled (-q), a complete dump of the contents of the cache is made.</p><p>The cache statistics are also available in the DNS as answers to queries of class CHAOS and type TXT in domain bind. The domain names are cachesize.bind, insertions.bind, evictions.bind, misses.bind, hits.bind, auth.bind and servers.bind. An example command to query this, using the <strong>dig</strong> utility would be</p><p>dig +short chaos txt cachesize.bind</p><p>When it receives SIGUSR2 and it is logging direct to a file (see <strong>--log-facility</strong> ) <strong>dnsmasq</strong> will close and reopen the log file. Note that during this operation, dnsmasq will not be running as root. When it first creates the logfile dnsmasq changes the ownership of the file to the non-root user it will run as. Logrotate should be configured to create a new log file with the ownership which matches the existing one before sending SIGUSR2. If TCP DNS queries are in progress, the old logfile will remain open in child processes which are handling TCP queries and may continue to be written. There is a limit of 150 seconds, after which all existing TCP processes will have expired: for this reason, it is not wise to configure logfile compression for logfiles which have just been rotated. Using logrotate, the required options are <strong>create</strong> and <strong>delaycompress.</strong></p><p>Dnsmasq is a DNS query forwarder: it it not capable of recursively answering arbitrary queries starting from the root servers but forwards such queries to a fully recursive upstream DNS server which is typically provided by an ISP. By default, dnsmasq reads <em>/etc/resolv.conf</em> to discover the IP addresses of the upstream nameservers it should use, since the information is typically stored there. Unless <strong>--no-poll</strong> is used, <strong>dnsmasq</strong> checks the modification time of <em>/etc/resolv.conf</em> (or equivalent if <strong>--resolv-file</strong> is used) and re-reads it if it changes. This allows the DNS servers to be set dynamically by PPP or DHCP since both protocols provide the information. Absence of <em>/etc/resolv.conf</em> is not an error since it may not have been created before a PPP connection exists. Dnsmasq simply keeps checking in case <em>/etc/resolv.conf</em> is created at any time. Dnsmasq can be told to parse more than one resolv.conf file. This is useful on a laptop, where both PPP and DHCP may be used: dnsmasq can be set to poll both <em>/etc/ppp/resolv.conf</em> and <em>/etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf</em> and will use the contents of whichever changed last, giving automatic switching between DNS servers.</p><p>Upstream servers may also be specified on the command line or in the configuration file. These server specifications optionally take a domain name which tells dnsmasq to use that server only to find names in that particular domain.</p><p>In order to configure dnsmasq to act as cache for the host on which it is running, put "nameserver 127.0.0.1" in <em>/etc/resolv.conf</em> to force local processes to send queries to dnsmasq. Then either specify the upstream servers directly to dnsmasq using <strong>--server</strong> options or put their addresses real in another file, say <em>/etc/resolv.dnsmasq</em> and run dnsmasq with the <strong>-r /etc/resolv.dnsmasq</strong> option. This second technique allows for dynamic update of the server addresses by PPP or DHCP.</p><p>Addresses in /etc/hosts will "shadow" different addresses for the same names in the upstream DNS, so "mycompany.com 1.2.3.4" in /etc/hosts will ensure that queries for "mycompany.com" always return 1.2.3.4 even if queries in the upstream DNS would otherwise return a different address. There is one exception to this: if the upstream DNS contains a CNAME which points to a shadowed name, then looking up the CNAME through dnsmasq will result in the unshadowed address associated with the target of the CNAME. To work around this, add the CNAME to /etc/hosts so that the CNAME is shadowed too.</p><p>The tag system works as follows: For each DHCP request, dnsmasq collects a set of valid tags from active configuration lines which include set:&lt;tag&gt;, including one from the <strong>dhcp-range</strong> used to allocate the address, one from any matching <strong>dhcp-host</strong> (and "known" if a dhcp-host matches) The tag "bootp" is set for BOOTP requests, and a tag whose name is the name of the interface on which the request arrived is also set.</p><p>Any configuration lines which include one or more tag:&lt;tag&gt; constructs will only be valid if all that tags are matched in the set derived above. Typically this is dhcp-option. <strong>dhcp-option</strong> which has tags will be used in preference  to an untagged <strong>dhcp-option,</strong> provided that _all_ the tags match somewhere in the set collected as described above. The prefix '!' on a tag means 'not' so --dhcp-option=tag:!purple,3,1.2.3.4 sends the option when the tag purple is not in the set of valid tags. (If using this in a command line rather than a configuration file, be sure to escape !, which is a shell metacharacter)</p><p>When selecting dhcp-options, a tag from dhcp-range is second class relative to other tags, to make it easy to override options for individual hosts, so <strong>dhcp-range=set:interface1,......</strong> <strong>dhcp-host=set:myhost,.....</strong> <strong>dhcp-option=tag:interface1,option:nis-domain,"domain1"</strong> <strong>dhcp-option=tag:myhost,option:nis-domain,"domain2"</strong> will set the NIS-domain to domain1 for hosts in the range, but override that to domain2 for a particular host.</p><p>Note that for <strong>dhcp-range</strong> both tag:&lt;tag&gt; and set:&lt;tag&gt; are allowed, to both select the range in use based on (eg) dhcp-host, and to affect the options sent, based on the range selected.</p><p>This system evolved from an earlier, more limited one and for backward compatibility "net:" may be used instead of "tag:" and "set:" may be omitted. (Except in <strong>dhcp-host,</strong> where "net:" may be used instead of "set:".) For the same reason, '#' may be used instead of '!' to indicate NOT.</p><p>The DHCP server in dnsmasq will function as a BOOTP server also, provided that the MAC address and IP address for clients are given, either using <strong>dhcp-host</strong> configurations or in <em>/etc/ethers</em> , and a <strong>dhcp-range</strong> configuration option is present to activate the DHCP server on a particular network. (Setting --bootp-dynamic removes the need for static address mappings.) The filename parameter in a BOOTP request is used as a tag, as is the tag "bootp", allowing some control over the options returned to different classes of hosts.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">AUTHORITATIVE CONFIGURATION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Configuring dnsmasq to act as an authoritative DNS server is complicated by the fact that it involves configuration of external DNS servers to provide delegation. We will walk through three scenarios of increasing complexity. Prerequisites for all of these scenarios are a globally accessible IP address, an A or AAAA record pointing to that address, and an external DNS server capable of doing delegation of the zone in question. For the first part of this explanation, we will call the A (or AAAA) record for the globally accessible address server.example.com, and the zone for which dnsmasq is authoritative our.zone.com.</p><p>The simplest configuration consists of two lines of dnsmasq configuration; something like</p>
<pre>
<strong>auth-server=server.example.com,eth0</strong>
<strong>auth-zone=our.zone.com,1.2.3.0/24</strong>
</pre>
<p>and two records in the external DNS</p>
<pre>
server.example.com       A    192.0.43.10
our.zone.com            NS    server.example.com
</pre>
<p>eth0 is the external network interface on which dnsmasq is listening, and has (globally accessible) address 192.0.43.10.</p><p>Note that the external IP address may well be dynamic (ie assigned from an ISP by DHCP or PPP) If so, the A record must be linked to this dynamic assignment by one of the usual dynamic-DNS systems.</p><p>A more complex, but practically useful configuration has the address record for the globally accessible IP address residing in the authoritative zone which dnsmasq is serving, typically at the root. Now we have</p>
<pre>
<strong>auth-server=our.zone.com,eth0</strong>
<strong>auth-zone=our.zone.com,1.2.3.0/24</strong>
</pre>

<pre>
our.zone.com             A    1.2.3.4
our.zone.com            NS    our.zone.com
</pre>
<p>The A record for our.zone.com has now become a glue record, it solves the chicken-and-egg problem of finding the IP address of the nameserver for our.zone.com when the A record is within that zone. Note that this is the only role of this record: as dnsmasq is now authoritative from our.zone.com it too must provide this record. If the external address is static, this can be done with an <strong>/etc/hosts</strong> entry or <strong>--host-record.</strong></p>
<pre>
<strong>auth-server=our.zone.com,eth0</strong>
<strong>host-record=our.zone.com,1.2.3.4</strong>
<strong>auth-zone=our.zone.com,1.2.3.0/24</strong>
</pre>
<p>If the external address is dynamic, the address associated with our.zone.com must be derived from the address of the relevant interface. This is done using <strong>interface-name</strong> Something like:</p>
<pre>
<strong>auth-server=our.zone.com,eth0</strong>
<strong>interface-name=our.zone.com,eth0</strong>
<strong>auth-zone=our.zone.com,1.2.3.0/24,eth0</strong>
</pre>
<p>(The "eth0" argument in auth-zone adds the subnet containing eth0's dynamic address to the zone, so that the interface-name returns the address in outside queries.)</p><p>Our final configuration builds on that above, but also adds a secondary DNS server. This is another DNS server which learns the DNS data for the zone by doing zones transfer, and acts as a backup should the primary server become inaccessible. The configuration of the secondary is beyond the scope of this man-page, but the extra configuration of dnsmasq is simple:</p>
<pre>
<strong>auth-sec-servers=secondary.myisp.com</strong>
</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>
our.zone.com           NS    secondary.myisp.com
</pre>
<p>Adding auth-sec-servers enables zone transfer in dnsmasq, to allow the secondary to collect the DNS data. If you wish to restrict this data to particular hosts then</p>
<pre>
<strong>auth-peer=&lt;IP address of secondary&gt;</strong>
</pre>
<p>will do so.</p><p>Dnsmasq acts as an authoritative server for  in-addr.arpa and ip6.arpa domains associated with the subnets given in auth-zone declarations, so reverse (address to name) lookups can be simply configured with a suitable NS record, for instance in this example, where we allow 1.2.3.0/24 addresses.</p>
<pre>
 3.2.1.in-addr.arpa  NS    our.zone.com
</pre>
<p>Note that at present, reverse (in-addr.arpa and ip6.arpa) zones are not available in zone transfers, so there is no point arranging secondary servers for reverse lookups.</p><p>When dnsmasq is configured to act as an authoritative server, the following data is used to populate the authoritative zone.</p><p><strong>--mx-host, --srv-host, --dns-rr, --txt-record, --naptr-record</strong> , as long as the record names are in the authoritative domain.</p><p><strong>--cname</strong> as long as the record name is in  the authoritative domain. If the target of the CNAME is unqualified, then it  is qualified with the authoritative zone name.</p><p>IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from /etc/hosts (and <strong>--addn-hosts</strong> ) and <strong>--host-record</strong> and <strong>--interface-name</strong> provided the address falls into one of the subnets specified in the <strong>--auth-zone.</strong></p><p>Addresses of DHCP leases, provided the address falls into one of the subnets specified in the <strong>--auth-zone.</strong> (If contructed DHCP ranges are is use, which depend on the address dynamically assigned to an interface, then the form of <strong>--auth-zone</strong> which defines subnets by the dynamic address of an interface should be used to ensure this condition is met.)</p><p>In the default mode, where a DHCP lease has an unqualified name, and possibly a qualified name constructed using <strong>--domain</strong> then the name in the authoritative zone is constructed from the unqualified name and the zone's domain. This may or may not equal that specified by <strong>--domain.</strong> If <strong>--dhcp-fqdn</strong> is set, then the fully qualified names associated with DHCP leases are used, and must match the zone's domain.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">LIMITS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The default values for resource limits in dnsmasq are generally conservative, and appropriate for embedded router type devices with slow processors and limited memory. On more capable hardware, it is possible to increase the limits, and handle many more clients. The following applies to dnsmasq-2.37: earlier versions did not scale as well.</p><p>Dnsmasq is capable of handling DNS and DHCP for at least a thousand clients. The DHCP lease times should not be very short (less than one hour). The value of <strong>--dns-forward-max</strong> can be increased: start with it equal to the number of clients and increase if DNS seems slow. Note that DNS performance depends too on the performance of the upstream nameservers. The size of the DNS cache may be increased: the hard limit is 10000 names and the default (150) is very low. Sending SIGUSR1 to dnsmasq makes it log information which is useful for tuning the cache size. See the <strong>NOTES</strong> section for details.</p><p>The built-in TFTP server is capable of many simultaneous file transfers: the absolute limit is related to the number of file-handles allowed to a process and the ability of the select() system call to cope with large numbers of file handles. If the limit is set too high using <strong>--tftp-max</strong> it will be scaled down and the actual limit logged at start-up. Note that more transfers are possible when the same file is being sent than when each transfer sends a different file.</p><p>It is possible to use dnsmasq to block Web advertising by using a list of known banner-ad servers, all resolving to 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0, in <strong>/etc/hosts</strong> or an additional hosts file. The list can be very long, dnsmasq has been tested successfully with one million names. That size file needs a 1GHz processor and about 60Mb of RAM.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">INTERNATIONALISATION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Dnsmasq can be compiled to support internationalisation. To do this, the make targets "all-i18n" and "install-i18n" should be used instead of the standard targets "all" and "install". When internationalisation is compiled in, dnsmasq will produce log messages in the local language and support internationalised domain names (IDN). Domain names in /etc/hosts, /etc/ethers and /etc/dnsmasq.conf which contain non-ASCII characters will be translated to the DNS-internal punycode representation. Note that dnsmasq determines both the language for messages and the assumed charset for configuration files from the LANG environment variable. This should be set to the system default value by the script which is responsible for starting dnsmasq. When editing the configuration files, be careful to do so using only the system-default locale and not user-specific one, since dnsmasq has no direct way of determining the charset in use, and must assume that it is the system default.</p>
