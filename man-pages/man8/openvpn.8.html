        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>OpenVPN is an open source VPN daemon by James Yonan. Because OpenVPN tries to be a universal VPN tool offering a great deal of flexibility, there are a lot of options on this manual page. If you're new to OpenVPN, you might want to skip ahead to the examples section where you will see how to construct simple VPNs on the command line without even needing a configuration file.</p><p>Also note that there's more documentation and examples on the OpenVPN web site: <em>http://openvpn.net/</em></p><p>And if you would like to see a shorter version of this manual, see the openvpn usage message which can be obtained by running <strong>openvpn</strong> without any parameters.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>OpenVPN is a robust and highly flexible VPN daemon. OpenVPN supports SSL/TLS security, ethernet bridging, TCP or UDP tunnel transport through proxies or NAT, support for dynamic IP addresses and DHCP, scalability to hundreds or thousands of users, and portability to most major OS platforms.</p><p>OpenVPN is tightly bound to the OpenSSL library, and derives much of its crypto capabilities from it.</p><p>OpenVPN supports conventional encryption using a pre-shared secret key <strong>(Static Key mode)</strong> or public key security <strong>(SSL/TLS mode)</strong> using client & server certificates. OpenVPN also supports non-encrypted TCP/UDP tunnels.</p><p>OpenVPN is designed to work with the <strong>TUN/TAP</strong> virtual networking interface that exists on most platforms.</p><p>Overall, OpenVPN aims to offer many of the key features of IPSec but with a relatively lightweight footprint.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>OpenVPN allows any option to be placed either on the command line or in a configuration file.  Though all command line options are preceded by a double-leading-dash ("--"), this prefix can be removed when an option is placed in a configuration file.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--help</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Show options.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--config file</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Load additional config options from <strong>file</strong> where each line corresponds to one command line option, but with the leading '--' removed.</p><p>If <strong>--config file</strong> is the only option to the openvpn command, the <strong>--config</strong> can be removed, and the command can be given as <strong>openvpn file</strong></p><p>Note that configuration files can be nested to a reasonable depth.</p><p>Double quotation or single quotation characters ("", '') can be used to enclose single parameters containing whitespace, and "#" or ";" characters in the first column can be used to denote comments.</p><p>Note that OpenVPN 2.0 and higher performs backslash-based shell escaping for characters not in single quotations, so the following mappings should be observed:</p>
<pre>
&#92;nbsp;      Maps to a single backslash character (&#92;).

         interpret it as enclosing a parameter.
&#92;[SPACE] Pass a literal space or tab character, don't
         interpret it as a parameter delimiter.
</pre>
<p>For example on Windows, use double backslashes to represent pathnames:</p>
<pre>
secret "c:&#92;&#92;OpenVPN&#92;&#92;secret.key"
</pre>
<p>For examples of configuration files, see <em>http://openvpn.net/examples.html</em></p><p>Here is an example configuration file:</p>
<pre>
#
# Sample OpenVPN configuration file for
# using a pre-shared static key.
#
# '#' or ';' may be used to delimit comments.

# Use a dynamic tun device.

# 10.1.0.1 is our local VPN endpoint
# 10.1.0.2 is our remote VPN endpoint

<h3>Tunnel Options:</h3>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--mode m</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set OpenVPN major mode.  By default, OpenVPN runs in point-to-point mode ("p2p").  OpenVPN 2.0 introduces a new mode ("server") which implements a multi-client server capability.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--local host</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Local host name or IP address for bind. If specified, OpenVPN will bind to this address only. If unspecified, OpenVPN will bind to all interfaces.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--remote host [port] [proto]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Remote host name or IP address.  On the client, multiple <strong>--remote</strong> options may be specified for redundancy, each referring to a different OpenVPN server.  Specifying multiple <strong>--remote</strong> options for this purpose is a special case of the more general connection-profile feature.  See the <strong>&lt;connection&gt;</strong> documentation below.</p><p>The OpenVPN client will try to connect to a server at <strong>host:port</strong> in the order specified by the list of <strong>--remote</strong> options.</p><p><strong>proto</strong> indicates the protocol to use when connecting with the remote, and may be "tcp" or "udp".</p><p>The client will move on to the next host in the list, in the event of connection failure. Note that at any given time, the OpenVPN client will at most be connected to one server.</p><p>Note that since UDP is connectionless, connection failure is defined by the <strong>--ping</strong> and <strong>--ping-restart</strong> options.</p><p>Note the following corner case:  If you use multiple <strong>--remote</strong> options, AND you are dropping root privileges on the client with <strong>--user</strong> and/or <strong>--group,</strong> AND the client is running a non-Windows OS, if the client needs to switch to a different server, and that server pushes back different TUN/TAP or route settings, the client may lack the necessary privileges to close and reopen the TUN/TAP interface. This could cause the client to exit with a fatal error.</p><p>If <strong>--remote</strong> is unspecified, OpenVPN will listen for packets from any IP address, but will not act on those packets unless they pass all authentication tests.  This requirement for authentication is binding on all potential peers, even those from known and supposedly trusted IP addresses (it is very easy to forge a source IP address on a UDP packet).</p><p>When used in TCP mode, <strong>--remote</strong> will act as a filter, rejecting connections from any host which does not match <strong>host.</strong></p><p>If <strong>host</strong> is a DNS name which resolves to multiple IP addresses, one will be randomly chosen, providing a sort of basic load-balancing and failover capability.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--remote-random-hostname</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Prepend a random string (6 bytes, 12 hex characters) to hostname to prevent DNS caching.  For example, "foo.bar.gov" would be modified to "&lt;random-chars&gt;.foo.bar.gov".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>&lt;connection&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Define a client connection profile.  Client connection profiles are groups of OpenVPN options that describe how to connect to a given OpenVPN server.  Client connection profiles are specified within an OpenVPN configuration file, and each profile is bracketed by <strong>&lt;connection&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;/connection&gt;.</strong></p><p>An OpenVPN client will try each connection profile sequentially until it achieves a successful connection.</p><p><strong>--remote-random</strong> can be used to initially "scramble" the connection list.</p><p>Here is an example of connection profile usage:</p>
<pre>
client
dev tun

&lt;connection&gt;
remote 198.19.34.56 1194 udp
&lt;/connection&gt;

&lt;connection&gt;
remote 198.19.34.56 443 tcp
&lt;/connection&gt;

&lt;connection&gt;
remote 198.19.34.56 443 tcp
http-proxy 192.168.0.8 8080
http-proxy-retry
&lt;/connection&gt;

&lt;connection&gt;
remote 198.19.36.99 443 tcp
http-proxy 192.168.0.8 8080
http-proxy-retry
&lt;/connection&gt;

<p>First we try to connect to a server at 198.19.34.56:1194 using UDP. If that fails, we then try to connect to 198.19.34.56:443 using TCP. If that also fails, then try connecting through an HTTP proxy at 192.168.0.8:8080 to 198.19.34.56:443 using TCP.  Finally, try to connect through the same proxy to a server at 198.19.36.99:443 using TCP.</p><p>The following OpenVPN options may be used inside of a <strong>&lt;connection&gt;</strong> block:</p><p><strong>bind,</strong> <strong>connect-retry,</strong> <strong>connect-retry-max,</strong> <strong>connect-timeout,</strong> <strong>explicit-exit-notify,</strong> <strong>float,</strong> <strong>fragment,</strong> <strong>http-proxy,</strong> <strong>http-proxy-option,</strong> <strong>http-proxy-retry,</strong> <strong>http-proxy-timeout,</strong> <strong>link-mtu,</strong> <strong>local,</strong> <strong>lport,</strong> <strong>mssfix,</strong> <strong>mtu-disc,</strong> <strong>nobind,</strong> <strong>port,</strong> <strong>proto,</strong> <strong>remote,</strong> <strong>rport,</strong> <strong>socks-proxy,</strong> <strong>socks-proxy-retry,</strong> <strong>tun-mtu and</strong> <strong>tun-mtu-extra.</strong></p><p>A defaulting mechanism exists for specifying options to apply to all <strong>&lt;connection&gt;</strong> profiles.  If any of the above options (with the exception of <strong>remote</strong> ) appear outside of a <strong>&lt;connection&gt;</strong> block, but in a configuration file which has one or more <strong>&lt;connection&gt;</strong> blocks, the option setting will be used as a default for <strong>&lt;connection&gt;</strong> blocks which follow it in the configuration file.</p><p>For example, suppose the <strong>nobind</strong> option were placed in the sample configuration file above, near the top of the file, before the first <strong>&lt;connection&gt;</strong> block.  The effect would be as if <strong>nobind</strong> were declared in all <strong>&lt;connection&gt;</strong> blocks below it.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--proto-force p</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When iterating through connection profiles, only consider profiles using protocol <strong>p</strong> ('tcp'|'udp').</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--remote-random</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When multiple <strong>--remote</strong> address/ports are specified, or if connection profiles are being used, initially randomize the order of the list as a kind of basic load-balancing measure.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--proto p</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use protocol <strong>p</strong> for communicating with remote host. <strong>p</strong> can be <strong>udp,</strong> <strong>tcp-client,</strong> or <strong>tcp-server.</strong></p><p>The default protocol is <strong>udp</strong> when <strong>--proto</strong> is not specified.</p><p>For UDP operation, <strong>--proto udp</strong> should be specified on both peers.</p><p>For TCP operation, one peer must use <strong>--proto tcp-server</strong> and the other must use <strong>--proto tcp-client.</strong> A peer started with <strong>tcp-server</strong> will wait indefinitely for an incoming connection.  A peer started with <strong>tcp-client</strong> will attempt to connect, and if that fails, will sleep for 5 seconds (adjustable via the <strong>--connect-retry</strong> option) and try again infinite or up to N retries (adjustable via the <strong>--connect-retry-max</strong> option).  Both TCP client and server will simulate a SIGUSR1 restart signal if either side resets the connection.</p><p>OpenVPN is designed to operate optimally over UDP, but TCP capability is provided for situations where UDP cannot be used. In comparison with UDP, TCP will usually be somewhat less efficient and less robust when used over unreliable or congested networks.</p><p>This article outlines some of problems with tunneling IP over TCP:</p><p><em>http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html</em></p><p>There are certain cases, however, where using TCP may be advantageous from a security and robustness perspective, such as tunneling non-IP or application-level UDP protocols, or tunneling protocols which don't possess a built-in reliability layer.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--connect-retry n</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>For <strong>--proto tcp-client,</strong> take <strong>n</strong> as the number of seconds to wait between connection retries (default=5).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--connect-timeout n</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>For <strong>--proto tcp-client,</strong> set connection timeout to <strong>n</strong> seconds (default=10).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--connect-retry-max n</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>For <strong>--proto tcp-client,</strong> take <strong>n</strong> as the number of retries of connection attempt (default=infinite).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--show-proxy-settings</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Show sensed HTTP or SOCKS proxy settings. Currently, only Windows clients support this option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--http-proxy server port [authfile|'auto'|'auto-nct'] [auth-method]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Connect to remote host through an HTTP proxy at address <strong>server</strong> and port <strong>port.</strong> If HTTP Proxy-Authenticate is required, <strong>authfile</strong> is a file containing a username and password on 2 lines, or "stdin" to prompt from console.</p><p><strong>auth-method</strong> should be one of "none", "basic", or "ntlm".</p><p>HTTP Digest authentication is supported as well, but only via the <strong>auto</strong> or <strong>auto-nct</strong> flags (below).</p><p>The <strong>auto</strong> flag causes OpenVPN to automatically determine the <strong>auth-method</strong> and query stdin or the management interface for username/password credentials, if required.  This flag exists on OpenVPN 2.1 or higher.</p><p>The <strong>auto-nct</strong> flag (no clear-text auth) instructs OpenVPN to automatically determine the authentication method, but to reject weak authentication protocols such as HTTP Basic Authentication.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--http-proxy-retry</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Retry indefinitely on HTTP proxy errors.  If an HTTP proxy error occurs, simulate a SIGUSR1 reset.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--http-proxy-timeout n</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set proxy timeout to <strong>n</strong> seconds, default=5.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--http-proxy-option type [parm]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set extended HTTP proxy options. Repeat to set multiple options.</p><p><strong>VERSION version --</strong> Set HTTP version number to <strong>version</strong> (default=1.0).</p><p><strong>AGENT user-agent --</strong> Set HTTP "User-Agent" string to <strong>user-agent.</strong></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--socks-proxy server [port] [authfile]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Connect to remote host through a Socks5 proxy at address <strong>server</strong> and port <strong>port</strong> (default=1080). <strong>authfile</strong> (optional) is a file containing a username and password on 2 lines, or "stdin" to prompt from console.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--socks-proxy-retry</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Retry indefinitely on Socks proxy errors.  If a Socks proxy error occurs, simulate a SIGUSR1 reset.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--resolv-retry n</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If hostname resolve fails for <strong>--remote,</strong> retry resolve for <strong>n</strong> seconds before failing.</p><p>Set <strong>n</strong> to "infinite" to retry indefinitely.</p><p>By default, <strong>--resolv-retry infinite</strong> is enabled.  You can disable by setting n=0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--float</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Allow remote peer to change its IP address and/or port number, such as due to DHCP (this is the default if <strong>--remote</strong> is not used). <strong>--float</strong> when specified with <strong>--remote</strong> allows an OpenVPN session to initially connect to a peer at a known address, however if packets arrive from a new address and pass all authentication tests, the new address will take control of the session.  This is useful when you are connecting to a peer which holds a dynamic address such as a dial-in user or DHCP client.</p><p>Essentially, <strong>--float</strong> tells OpenVPN to accept authenticated packets from any address, not only the address which was specified in the <strong>--remote</strong> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--ipchange cmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Run command <strong>cmd</strong> when our remote ip-address is initially authenticated or changes.</p><p><strong>cmd</strong> consists of a path to script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.</p><p>When <strong>cmd</strong> is executed two arguments are appended after any arguments specified in <strong>cmd</strong> , as follows:</p><p><strong>cmd ip_address port_number</strong></p><p>Don't use <strong>--ipchange</strong> in <strong>--mode server</strong> mode.  Use a <strong>--client-connect</strong> script instead.</p><p>See the "Environmental Variables" section below for additional parameters passed as environmental variables.</p><p>If you are running in a dynamic IP address environment where the IP addresses of either peer could change without notice, you can use this script, for example, to edit the <em>/etc/hosts</em> file with the current address of the peer.  The script will be run every time the remote peer changes its IP address.</p><p>Similarly if <em>our</em> IP address changes due to DHCP, we should configure our IP address change script (see man page for <strong>dhcpcd</strong>(8) ) to deliver a <strong>SIGHUP</strong> or <strong>SIGUSR1</strong> signal to OpenVPN.  OpenVPN will then reestablish a connection with its most recently authenticated peer on its new IP address.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--port port</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>TCP/UDP port number for both local and remote.  The current default of 1194 represents the official IANA port number assignment for OpenVPN and has been used since version 2.0-beta17. Previous versions used port 5000 as the default.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--lport port</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>TCP/UDP port number for bind.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--rport port</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>TCP/UDP port number for remote.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--bind</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Bind to local address and port. This is the default unless any of <strong>--proto tcp-client</strong> , <strong>--http-proxy</strong> or <strong>--socks-proxy</strong> are used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--nobind</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Do not bind to local address and port.  The IP stack will allocate a dynamic port for returning packets.  Since the value of the dynamic port could not be known in advance by a peer, this option is only suitable for peers which will be initiating connections by using the <strong>--remote</strong> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--dev tunX | tapX | null</strong></p>
  </dt>

Like the <strong>--dev</strong> directive, this directive must always be compatible between client and server.</p><p><strong>mode</strong> can be one of:</p><p><strong>net30 --</strong> Use a point-to-point topology, by allocating one /30 subnet per client. This is designed to allow point-to-point semantics when some or all of the connecting clients might be Windows systems.  This is the default on OpenVPN 2.0.</p><p><strong>p2p --</strong> Use a point-to-point topology where the remote endpoint of the client's tun interface always points to the local endpoint of the server's tun interface. This mode allocates a single IP address per connecting client. Only use when none of the connecting clients are Windows systems.  This mode is functionally equivalent to the <strong>--ifconfig-pool-linear</strong> directive which is available in OpenVPN 2.0 and is now deprecated.</p><p><strong>subnet --</strong> Use a subnet rather than a point-to-point topology by configuring the tun interface with a local IP address and subnet mask, similar to the topology used in <strong>--dev tap</strong> and ethernet bridging mode. This mode allocates a single IP address per connecting client and works on Windows as well.  Only available when server and clients are OpenVPN 2.1 or higher, or OpenVPN 2.0.x which has been manually patched with the <strong>--topology</strong> directive code.  When used on Windows, requires version 8.2 or higher of the TAP-Win32 driver.  When used on *nix, requires that the tun driver supports an <a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html"><strong>ifconfig</strong>(8)</a> command which sets a subnet instead of a remote endpoint IP address.</p><p>This option exists in OpenVPN 2.1 or higher.</p>

Using <strong>--dev-node utun</strong> forces usage of the native Darwin tun kernel support. Use <strong>--dev-node utunN</strong> to select a specific utun instance. To force using the tun.kext (/dev/tunX) use <strong>--dev-node tun</strong>.

The IP addresses may be consecutive and should have their order reversed on the remote peer.  After the VPN is established, by pinging <strong>rn,</strong> you will be pinging across the VPN.</p><p>For TAP devices, which provide the ability to create virtual ethernet segments, <strong>--ifconfig</strong> is used to set an IP address and subnet mask just as a physical ethernet adapter would be similarly configured.  If you are attempting to connect to a remote ethernet bridge, the IP address and subnet should be set to values which would be valid on the the bridged ethernet segment (note also that DHCP can be used for the same purpose).</p><p>This option, while primarily a proxy for the <a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html"><strong>ifconfig</strong>(8)</a> command, is designed to simplify TUN/TAP tunnel configuration by providing a standard interface to the different ifconfig implementations on different platforms.</p><p><strong>--ifconfig</strong> parameters which are IP addresses can also be specified as a DNS or /etc/hosts file resolvable name.</p><p>For TAP devices, <strong>--ifconfig</strong> should not be used if the TAP interface will be getting an IP address lease from a DHCP server.</p>

It ensures that even if an attacker was able to crack the box running OpenVPN, he would not be able to scan the system swap file to recover previously used ephemeral keys, which are used for a period of time governed by the <strong>--reneg</strong> options (see below), then are discarded.</p><p>The downside of using <strong>--mlock</strong> is that it will reduce the amount of physical memory available to other applications.</p>

In this context, the last command line parameter passed to the script will be <em>init.</em> If the <strong>--up-restart</strong> option is also used, the up script will be called for restarts as well.  A restart is considered to be a partial reinitialization of OpenVPN where the TUN/TAP instance is preserved (the <strong>--persist-tun</strong> option will enable such preservation).  A restart can be generated by a SIGUSR1 signal, a <strong>--ping-restart</strong> timeout, or a connection reset when the TCP protocol is enabled with the <strong>--proto</strong> option.  If a restart occurs, and <strong>--up-restart</strong> has been specified, the up script will be called with <em>restart</em> as the last parameter.</p><p>The following standalone example shows how the <strong>--up</strong> script can be called in both an initialization and restart context.

    <p>This directive offers policy-level control over OpenVPN's usage of external programs and scripts.  Lower <strong>level</strong> values are more restrictive, higher values are more permissive.  Settings for <strong>level:</strong></p><p><strong>0 --</strong> Strictly no calling of external programs.</p><p><strong>1 --</strong> (Default) Only call built-in executables such as ifconfig, ip, route, or netsh.</p><p><strong>2 --</strong> Allow calling of built-in executables and user-defined scripts.</p><p><strong>3 --</strong> Allow passwords to be passed to scripts via environmental variables (potentially unsafe).</p><p>OpenVPN releases before v2.3 also supported a <strong>method</strong> flag which indicated how OpenVPN should call external commands and scripts.  This could be either <strong>execve</strong> or <strong>system.</strong> As of OpenVPN v2.3, this flag is no longer accepted.  In most *nix environments the execve() approach has been used without any issues.</p><p>To run scripts in Windows in earlier OpenVPN versions you needed to either add a full path to the script interpreter which can parse the script or use the <strong>system</strong> flag to run these scripts.  As of OpenVPN v2.3 it is now a strict requirement to have full path to the script interpreter when running non-executables files. This is not needed for executable files, such as .exe, .com, .bat or .cmd files.  For example, if you have a Visual Basic script, you must use this syntax now:</p>
<pre>
--up 'C:&#92;&#92;Windows&#92;&#92;System32&#92;&#92;wscript.exe C:&#92;&#92;Programnbsp;Files&#92;&#92;OpenVPN&#92;&#92;config&#92;&#92;my-up-script.vbs'
</pre>
<p>Please note the single quote marks and the escaping of the backslashes (&#92;) and the space character.</p><p>The reason the support for the <strong>system</strong> flag was removed is due to the security implications with shell expansions when executing scripts via the system() call.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--disable-occ</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Don't output a warning message if option inconsistencies are detected between peers.  An example of an option inconsistency would be where one peer uses <strong>--dev tun</strong> while the other peer uses <strong>--dev tap.</strong></p><p>Use of this option is discouraged, but is provided as a temporary fix in situations where a recent version of OpenVPN must connect to an old version.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>--user user</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change the user ID of the OpenVPN process to <strong>user</strong> after initialization, dropping privileges in the process. This option is useful to protect the system in the event that some hostile party was able to gain control of an OpenVPN session.  Though OpenVPN's security features make this unlikely, it is provided as a second line of defense.</p><p>By setting <strong>user</strong> to <em>nobody</em> or somebody similarly unprivileged, the hostile party would be limited in what damage they could cause.  Of course once you take away privileges, you cannot return them to an OpenVPN session.  This means, for example, that if you want to reset an OpenVPN daemon with a <strong>SIGUSR1</strong> signal (for example in response to a DHCP reset), you should make use of one or more of the <strong>--persist</strong> options to ensure that OpenVPN doesn't need to execute any privileged operations in order to restart (such as re-reading key files or running <strong>ifconfig</strong> on the TUN device).</p>

    <p><strong>--cd dir</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change directory to <strong>dir</strong> prior to reading any files such as configuration files, key files, scripts, etc. <strong>dir</strong> should be an absolute path, with a leading "/", and without any references to the current directory such as "." or "..".</p><p>This option is useful when you are running OpenVPN in <strong>--daemon</strong> mode, and you want to consolidate all of your OpenVPN control files in one location.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--chroot dir</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Chroot to <strong>dir</strong> after initialization. <strong>--chroot</strong> essentially redefines <strong>dir</strong> as being the top level directory tree (/).  OpenVPN will therefore be unable to access any files outside this tree. This can be desirable from a security standpoint.</p><p>Since the chroot operation is delayed until after initialization, most OpenVPN options that reference files will operate in a pre-chroot context.</p><p>In many cases, the <strong>dir</strong> parameter can point to an empty directory, however complications can result when scripts or restarts are executed after the chroot operation.</p><p>Note: if OpenVPN is built using the PolarSSL SSL library, <strong>--chroot</strong> will only work if a /dev/urandom device node is available inside the chroot directory <strong>dir.</strong> This is due to the way PolarSSL works (it wants to open /dev/urandom every time randomness is needed, not just once at startup) and nothing OpenVPN can influence.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--setcon context</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Apply SELinux <strong>context</strong> after initialization. This essentially provides the ability to restrict OpenVPN's rights to only network I/O operations, thanks to SELinux. This goes further than <strong>--user</strong> and <strong>--chroot</strong> in that those two, while being great security features, unfortunately do not protect against privilege escalation by exploitation of a vulnerable system call. You can of course combine all three, but please note that since setcon requires access to /proc you will have to provide it inside the chroot directory (e.g. with mount --bind).</p><p>Since the setcon operation is delayed until after initialization, OpenVPN can be restricted to just network-related system calls, whereas by applying the context before startup (such as the OpenVPN one provided in the SELinux Reference Policies) you will have to allow many things required only during initialization.</p><p>Like with chroot, complications can result when scripts or restarts are executed after the setcon operation, which is why you should really consider using the <strong>--persist-key</strong> and <strong>--persist-tun</strong> options.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--daemon [progname]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Become a daemon after all initialization functions are completed. This option will cause all message and error output to be sent to the syslog file (such as /var/log/messages), except for the output of scripts and ifconfig commands, which will go to /dev/null unless otherwise redirected. The syslog redirection occurs immediately at the point that <strong>--daemon</strong> is parsed on the command line even though the daemonization point occurs later.  If one of the <strong>--log</strong> options is present, it will supercede syslog redirection.</p><p>The optional <strong>progname</strong> parameter will cause OpenVPN to report its program name to the system logger as <strong>progname.</strong> This can be useful in linking OpenVPN messages in the syslog file with specific tunnels. When unspecified, <strong>progname</strong> defaults to "openvpn".</p><p>When OpenVPN is run with the <strong>--daemon</strong> option, it will try to delay daemonization until the majority of initialization functions which are capable of generating fatal errors are complete.  This means that initialization scripts can test the return status of the openvpn command for a fairly reliable indication of whether the command has correctly initialized and entered the packet forwarding event loop.</p><p>In OpenVPN, the vast majority of errors which occur after initialization are non-fatal.</p>

The <strong>nowait</strong> mode can only be used with <strong>--proto tcp-server.</strong> The default is <strong>wait.</strong> The <strong>nowait</strong> mode can be used to instantiate the OpenVPN daemon as a classic TCP server, where client connection requests are serviced on a single port number.  For additional information on this kind of configuration, see the OpenVPN FAQ: <em>http://openvpn.net/faq.html#oneport</em></p><p>This option precludes the use of <strong>--daemon, --local,</strong> or <strong>--remote.</strong> Note that this option causes message and error output to be handled in the same way as the <strong>--daemon</strong> option.  The optional <strong>progname</strong> parameter is also handled exactly as in <strong>--daemon.</strong></p><p>Also note that in <strong>wait</strong> mode, each OpenVPN tunnel requires a separate TCP/UDP port and a separate inetd or xinetd entry.  See the OpenVPN 1.x HOWTO for an example on using OpenVPN with xinetd: <em>http://openvpn.net/1xhowto.html</em></p>

    <p>Output logging messages to <strong>file,</strong> including output to stdout/stderr which is generated by called scripts. If <strong>file</strong> already exists it will be truncated. This option takes effect immediately when it is parsed in the command line and will supercede syslog output if <strong>--daemon</strong> or <strong>--inetd</strong> is also specified. This option is persistent over the entire course of an OpenVPN instantiation and will not be reset by SIGHUP, SIGUSR1, or <strong>--ping-restart.</strong></p><p>Note that on Windows, when OpenVPN is started as a service, logging occurs by default without the need to specify this option.</p>

With adaptive compression, OpenVPN will periodically sample the compression process to measure its efficiency.  If the data being sent over the tunnel is already compressed, the compression efficiency will be very low, triggering openvpn to disable compression for a period of time until the next re-sample test.</p>

The password provided will set the password which TCP clients will need to provide in order to access management functions.</p><p>The management interface can also listen on a unix domain socket, for those platforms that support it.  To use a unix domain socket, specify the unix socket pathname in place of <strong>IP</strong> and set <strong>port</strong> to 'unix'.  While the default behavior is to create a unix domain socket that may be connected to by any process, the <strong>--management-client-user</strong> and <strong>--management-client-group</strong> directives can be used to restrict access.</p><p>The management interface provides a special mode where the TCP management link can operate over the tunnel itself.  To enable this mode, set <strong>IP</strong> = "tunnel".  Tunnel mode will cause the management interface to listen for a TCP connection on the local VPN address of the TUN/TAP interface.</p><p>While the management port is designed for programmatic control of OpenVPN by other applications, it is possible to telnet to the port, using a telnet client in "raw" mode.

<h3>Server Mode</h3>
<p>Starting with OpenVPN 2.0, a multi-client TCP/UDP server mode is supported, and can be enabled with the <strong>--mode server</strong> option.  In server mode, OpenVPN will listen on a single port for incoming client connections.  All client connections will be routed through a single tun or tap interface.  This mode is designed for scalability and should be able to support hundreds or even thousands of clients on sufficiently fast hardware.  SSL/TLS authentication must be used in this mode.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--server network netmask</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A helper directive designed to simplify the configuration of OpenVPN's server mode.  This directive will set up an OpenVPN server which will allocate addresses to clients out of the given network/netmask.  The server itself will take the ".1" address of the given network for use as the server-side endpoint of the local TUN/TAP interface.</p><p>For example, <strong>--server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0</strong> expands as follows:</p>
<pre>
 mode server
 tls-server
 push "topology [topology]"

 if dev tun AND (topology == net30 OR topology == p2p):
   ifconfig 10.8.0.1 10.8.0.2

    <p><strong>--server-bridge ['nogw']</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A helper directive similar to <strong>--server</strong> which is designed to simplify the configuration of OpenVPN's server mode in ethernet bridging configurations.</p><p>If <strong>--server-bridge</strong> is used without any parameters, it will enable a DHCP-proxy mode, where connecting OpenVPN clients will receive an IP address for their TAP adapter from the DHCP server running on the OpenVPN server-side LAN. Note that only clients that support the binding of a DHCP client with the TAP adapter (such as Windows) can support this mode.  The optional <strong>nogw</strong> flag (advanced) indicates that gateway information should not be pushed to the client.</p><p>To configure ethernet bridging, you must first use your OS's bridging capability to bridge the TAP interface with the ethernet NIC interface.  For example, on Linux this is done with the <strong>brctl</strong> tool, and with Windows XP it is done in the Network Connections Panel by selecting the ethernet and TAP adapters and right-clicking on "Bridge Connections".</p><p>Next you you must manually set the IP/netmask on the bridge interface.  The <strong>gateway</strong> and <strong>netmask</strong> parameters to <strong>--server-bridge</strong> can be set to either the IP/netmask of the bridge interface, or the IP/netmask of the default gateway/router on the bridged subnet.</p><p>Finally, set aside a IP range in the bridged subnet, denoted by <strong>pool-start-IP</strong> and <strong>pool-end-IP,</strong> for OpenVPN to allocate to connecting clients.</p><p>For example, <strong>server-bridge 10.8.0.4 255.255.255.0 10.8.0.128 10.8.0.254</strong> expands as follows:</p>
<pre>
mode server

ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.128 10.8.0.254 255.255.255.0
push "route-gateway 10.8.0.4"
</pre>
<p>In another example, <strong>--server-bridge</strong> (without parameters) expands as follows:</p>
<pre>
mode server
tls-server

push "route-gateway dhcp"

    <p>Push a config file option back to the client for remote execution.  Note that <strong></strong> option must be enclosed in double quotes ("").  The client must specify <strong>--pull</strong> in its config file.  The set of options which can be pushed is limited by both feasibility and security. Some options such as those which would execute scripts are banned, since they would effectively allow a compromised server to execute arbitrary code on the client. Other options such as TLS or MTU parameters cannot be pushed because the client needs to know them before the connection to the server can be initiated.</p><p>This is a partial list of options which can currently be pushed: <strong>--route, --route-gateway, --route-delay, --redirect-gateway,</strong> <strong>--ip-win32, --dhcp-option,</strong> <strong>--inactive, --ping, --ping-exit, --ping-restart,</strong> <strong>--setenv,</strong> <strong>--persist-key, --persist-tun, --echo,</strong> <strong>--comp-lzo,</strong> <strong>--socket-flags,</strong> <strong>--sndbuf, --rcvbuf</strong></p>

Use a CRL (certificate revocation list) instead (see the <strong>--crl-verify</strong> option).</p><p>This option must be associated with a specific client instance, which means that it must be specified either in a client instance config file using <strong>--client-config-dir</strong> or dynamically generated using a <strong>--client-connect</strong> script.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Persist/unpersist ifconfig-pool data to <strong>file,</strong> at <strong>seconds</strong> intervals (default=600), as well as on program startup and shutdown.</p><p>The goal of this option is to provide a long-term association between clients (denoted by their common name) and the virtual IP address assigned to them from the ifconfig-pool. Maintaining a long-term association is good for clients because it allows them to effectively use the <strong>--persist-tun</strong> option.</p><p><strong>file</strong> is a comma-delimited ASCII file, formatted as &lt;Common-Name&gt;,&lt;IP-address&gt;.</p><p>If <strong>seconds</strong> = 0, <strong>file</strong> will be treated as read-only.  This is useful if you would like to treat <strong>file</strong> as a configuration file.</p><p>Note that the entries in this file are treated by OpenVPN as suggestions only, based on past associations between a common name and IP address.

Note that the parameters <strong>local</strong> and <strong>remote-netmask</strong> are from the perspective of the client, not the server.  They may be DNS names rather than IP addresses, in which case they will be resolved on the server at the time of client connection.</p><p>The optional <strong>alias</strong> parameter may be used in cases where NAT causes the client view of its local endpoint to differ from the server view.  In this case <strong>local/remote-netmask</strong> will refer to the server view while <strong>alias/remote-netmask</strong> will refer to the client view.</p><p>This option must be associated with a specific client instance, which means that it must be specified either in a client instance config file using <strong>--client-config-dir</strong> or dynamically generated using a <strong>--client-connect</strong> script.</p><p>Remember also to include a <strong>--route</strong> directive in the main OpenVPN config file which encloses <strong>local,</strong> so that the kernel will know to route it to the server's TUN/TAP interface.</p><p>OpenVPN's internal client IP address selection algorithm works as follows:</p><p><strong>1</strong> -- Use <strong>--client-connect script</strong> generated file for static IP (first choice).</p><p><strong>2</strong> -- Use <strong>--client-config-dir</strong> file for static IP (next choice).</p><p><strong>3</strong> -- Use <strong>--ifconfig-pool</strong> allocation for dynamic IP (last choice).</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Generate an internal route to a specific client. The <strong>netmask</strong> parameter, if omitted, defaults to 255.255.255.255.</p><p>This directive can be used to route a fixed subnet from the server to a particular client, regardless of where the client is connecting from.  Remember that you must also add the route to the system routing table as well (such as by using the <strong>--route</strong> directive).  The reason why two routes are needed is that the <strong>--route</strong> directive routes the packet from the kernel to OpenVPN.  Once in OpenVPN, the <strong>--iroute</strong> directive routes to the specific client.</p><p>This option must be specified either in a client instance config file using <strong>--client-config-dir</strong> or dynamically generated using a <strong>--client-connect</strong> script.</p><p>The <strong>--iroute</strong> directive also has an important interaction with <strong>--push</strong> "route ...". <strong>--iroute</strong> essentially defines a subnet which is owned by a particular client (we will call this client A). If you would like other clients to be able to reach A's subnet, you can use <strong>--push</strong> "route ..." together with <strong>--client-to-client</strong> to effect this.  In order for all clients to see A's subnet, OpenVPN must push this route to all clients EXCEPT for A, since the subnet is already owned by A. OpenVPN accomplishes this by not not pushing a route to a client if it matches one of the client's iroutes.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>--client-to-client</strong></p>

  <dd>
    <p>Because the OpenVPN server mode handles multiple clients through a single tun or tap interface, it is effectively a router.  The <strong>--client-to-client</strong> flag tells OpenVPN to internally route client-to-client traffic rather than pushing all client-originating traffic to the TUN/TAP interface.</p><p>When this option is used, each client will "see" the other clients which are currently connected.

Normally, when <strong>--auth-user-pass-verify</strong> or <strong>--management-client-auth</strong> is specified (or an authentication plugin module), the OpenVPN server daemon will require connecting clients to specify a username and password.  This option makes the submission of a username/password by clients optional, passing the responsibility to the user-defined authentication module/script to accept or deny the client based on other factors (such as the setting of X509 certificate fields).  When this option is used, and a connecting client does not submit a username/password, the user-defined authentication module/script will see the username and password as being set to empty strings ("").

<h3>Data Channel Encryption Options:</h3>
<p>These options are meaningful for both Static & TLS-negotiated key modes (must be compatible between peers).</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--secret file [direction]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable Static Key encryption mode (non-TLS). Use pre-shared secret <strong>file</strong> which was generated with <strong>--genkey.</strong></p><p>The optional <strong>direction</strong> parameter enables the use of 4 distinct keys (HMAC-send, cipher-encrypt, HMAC-receive, cipher-decrypt), so that each data flow direction has a different set of HMAC and cipher keys. This has a number of desirable security properties including eliminating certain kinds of DoS and message replay attacks.</p><p>When the <strong>direction</strong> parameter is omitted, 2 keys are used bidirectionally, one for HMAC and the other for encryption/decryption.</p><p>The <strong>direction</strong> parameter should always be complementary on either side of the connection, i.e. one side should use "0" and the other should use "1", or both sides should omit it altogether.</p><p>The <strong>direction</strong> parameter requires that <strong>file</strong> contains a 2048 bit key.  While pre-1.5 versions of OpenVPN generate 1024 bit key files, any version of OpenVPN which supports the <strong>direction</strong> parameter, will also support 2048 bit key file generation using the <strong>--genkey</strong> option.</p><p>Static key encryption mode has certain advantages, the primary being ease of configuration.</p><p>There are no certificates or certificate authorities or complicated negotiation handshakes and protocols. The only requirement is that you have a pre-existing secure channel with your peer (such as <strong>ssh</strong> ) to initially copy the key.  This requirement, along with the fact that your key never changes unless you manually generate a new one, makes it somewhat less secure than TLS mode (see below).  If an attacker manages to steal your key, everything that was ever encrypted with it is compromised.  Contrast that to the perfect forward secrecy features of TLS mode (using Diffie Hellman key exchange), where even if an attacker was able to steal your private key, he would gain no information to help him decrypt past sessions.</p><p>Another advantageous aspect of Static Key encryption mode is that it is a handshake-free protocol without any distinguishing signature or feature (such as a header or protocol handshake sequence) that would mark the ciphertext packets as being generated by OpenVPN.  Anyone eavesdropping on the wire would see nothing but random-looking data.</p>

    <p>Authenticate packets with HMAC using message digest algorithm <strong>alg.</strong> (The default is <strong>SHA1</strong> ). HMAC is a commonly used message authentication algorithm (MAC) that uses a data string, a secure hash algorithm, and a key, to produce a digital signature.</p><p>OpenVPN's usage of HMAC is to first encrypt a packet, then HMAC the resulting ciphertext.</p><p>In static-key encryption mode, the HMAC key is included in the key file generated by <strong>--genkey.</strong> In TLS mode, the HMAC key is dynamically generated and shared between peers via the TLS control channel.  If OpenVPN receives a packet with a bad HMAC it will drop the packet. HMAC usually adds 16 or 20 bytes per packet. Set <strong>alg=none</strong> to disable authentication.</p><p>For more information on HMAC see <em>http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/papers/hmac.html</em></p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(Advanced) Disable OpenVPN's protection against replay attacks. Don't use this option unless you are prepared to make a tradeoff of greater efficiency in exchange for less security.</p><p>OpenVPN provides datagram replay protection by default.</p><p>Replay protection is accomplished by tagging each outgoing datagram with an identifier that is guaranteed to be unique for the key being used. The peer that receives the datagram will check for the uniqueness of the identifier.  If the identifier was already received in a previous datagram, OpenVPN will drop the packet.  Replay protection is important to defeat attacks such as a SYN flood attack, where the attacker listens in the wire, intercepts a TCP SYN packet (identifying it by the context in which it occurs in relation to other packets), then floods the receiving peer with copies of this packet.</p><p>OpenVPN's replay protection is implemented in slightly different ways, depending on the key management mode you have selected.</p><p>In Static Key mode or when using an CFB or OFB mode cipher, OpenVPN uses a 64 bit unique identifier that combines a time stamp with an incrementing sequence number.</p><p>When using TLS mode for key exchange and a CBC cipher mode, OpenVPN uses only a 32 bit sequence number without a time stamp, since OpenVPN can guarantee the uniqueness of this value for each key.  As in IPSec, if the sequence number is close to wrapping back to zero, OpenVPN will trigger a new key exchange.</p><p>To check for replays, OpenVPN uses the <em>sliding window</em> algorithm used by IPSec.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--replay-window n [t]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use a replay protection sliding-window of size <strong>n</strong> and a time window of <strong>t</strong> seconds.</p><p>By default <strong>n</strong> is 64 (the IPSec default) and <strong>t</strong> is 15 seconds.</p><p>This option is only relevant in UDP mode, i.e. when either <strong>--proto udp</strong> is specified, or no <strong>--proto</strong> option is specified.</p><p>When OpenVPN tunnels IP packets over UDP, there is the possibility that packets might be dropped or delivered out of order.  Because OpenVPN, like IPSec, is emulating the physical network layer, it will accept an out-of-order packet sequence, and will deliver such packets in the same order they were received to the TCP/IP protocol stack, provided they satisfy several constraints.</p><p><strong>(a)</strong> The packet cannot be a replay (unless <strong>--no-replay</strong> is specified, which disables replay protection altogether).</p><p><strong>(b)</strong> If a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted if the difference between its sequence number and the highest sequence number received so far is less than <strong>n.</strong></p><p><strong>(c)</strong> If a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted if it arrives no later than <strong>t</strong> seconds after any packet containing a higher sequence number.</p><p>If you are using a network link with a large pipeline (meaning that the product of bandwidth and latency is high), you may want to use a larger value for <strong>n.</strong> Satellite links in particular often require this.</p><p>If you run OpenVPN at <strong>--verb 4,</strong> you will see the message "Replay-window backtrack occurred [x]" every time the maximum sequence number backtrack seen thus far increases.  This can be used to calibrate <strong>n.</strong></p><p>There is some controversy on the appropriate method of handling packet reordering at the security layer.</p><p>Namely, to what extent should the security layer protect the encapsulated protocol from attacks which masquerade as the kinds of normal packet loss and reordering that occur over IP networks?</p><p>The IPSec and OpenVPN approach is to allow packet reordering within a certain fixed sequence number window.</p><p>OpenVPN adds to the IPSec model by limiting the window size in time as well as sequence space.</p><p>OpenVPN also adds TCP transport as an option (not offered by IPSec) in which case OpenVPN can adopt a very strict attitude towards message deletion and reordering:  Don't allow it.  Since TCP guarantees reliability, any packet loss or reordering event can be assumed to be an attack.</p><p>In this sense, it could be argued that TCP tunnel transport is preferred when tunneling non-IP or UDP application protocols which might be vulnerable to a message deletion or reordering attack which falls within the normal operational parameters of IP networks.</p><p>So I would make the statement that one should never tunnel a non-IP protocol or UDP application protocol over UDP, if the protocol might be vulnerable to a message deletion or reordering attack that falls within the normal operating parameters of what is to be expected from the physical IP layer.  The problem is easily fixed by simply using TCP as the VPN transport layer.</p>

<h3>TLS Mode Options:</h3>
<p>TLS mode is the most powerful crypto mode of OpenVPN in both security and flexibility. TLS mode works by establishing control and data channels which are multiplexed over a single TCP/UDP port.  OpenVPN initiates a TLS session over the control channel and uses it to exchange cipher and HMAC keys to protect the data channel.  TLS mode uses a robust reliability layer over the UDP connection for all control channel communication, while the data channel, over which encrypted tunnel data passes, is forwarded without any mediation.  The result is the best of both worlds: a fast data channel that forwards over UDP with only the overhead of encrypt, decrypt, and HMAC functions, and a control channel that provides all of the security features of TLS, including certificate-based authentication and Diffie Hellman forward secrecy.</p><p>To use TLS mode, each peer that runs OpenVPN should have its own local certificate/key pair ( <strong>--cert</strong> and <strong>--key</strong> ), signed by the root certificate which is specified in <strong>--ca.</strong></p><p>When two OpenVPN peers connect, each presents its local certificate to the other.  Each peer will then check that its partner peer presented a certificate which was signed by the master root certificate as specified in <strong>--ca.</strong></p><p>If that check on both peers succeeds, then the TLS negotiation will succeed, both OpenVPN peers will exchange temporary session keys, and the tunnel will begin passing data.</p><p>The OpenVPN distribution contains a set of scripts for managing RSA certificates & keys, located in the <em>easy-rsa</em> subdirectory.</p><p>The easy-rsa package is also rendered in web form here: <em>http://openvpn.net/easyrsa.html</em></p>

    <p>Local peer's signed certificate in .pem format -- must be signed by a certificate authority whose certificate is in <strong>--ca file.</strong> Each peer in an OpenVPN link running in TLS mode should have its own certificate and private key file.  In addition, each certificate should have been signed by the key of a certificate authority whose public key resides in the <strong>--ca</strong> certificate authority file. You can easily make your own certificate authority (see above) or pay money to use a commercial service such as thawte.com (in which case you will be helping to finance the world's second space tourist :). To generate a certificate, you can use a command such as:</p><p><strong>openssl req -nodes -new -keyout mycert.key -out mycert.csr</strong></p><p>If your certificate authority private key lives on another machine, copy the certificate signing request (mycert.csr) to this other machine (this can be done over an insecure channel such as email).  Now sign the certificate with a command such as:</p><p><strong>openssl ca -out mycert.crt -in mycert.csr</strong></p><p>Now copy the certificate (mycert.crt) back to the peer which initially generated the .csr file (this can be over a public medium). Note that the <strong>openssl ca</strong> command reads the location of the certificate authority key from its configuration file such as <strong>/usr/share/ssl/openssl.cnf</strong> -- note also that for certificate authority functions, you must set up the files <strong>index.txt</strong> (may be empty) and <strong>serial</strong> (initialize to <strong></strong> 01 ).</p>

Both client and server also generate some random seed material.  All key source material is exchanged over the TLS channel.

Method 2 is designed to closely parallel the key generation process used by TLS 1.0.</p><p>Note that in TLS mode, two separate levels of keying occur:</p><p>(1) The TLS connection is initially negotiated, with both sides of the connection producing certificates and verifying the certificate (or other authentication info provided) of the other side.  The <strong>--key-method</strong> parameter has no effect on this process.</p><p>(2) After the TLS connection is established, the tunnel session keys are separately negotiated over the existing secure TLS channel.

    <p><strong>--tls-timeout n</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Packet retransmit timeout on TLS control channel if no acknowledgment from remote within <strong>n</strong> seconds (default=2).  When OpenVPN sends a control packet to its peer, it will expect to receive an acknowledgement within <strong>n</strong> seconds or it will retransmit the packet, subject to a TCP-like exponential backoff algorithm.  This parameter only applies to control channel packets.  Data channel packets (which carry encrypted tunnel data) are never acknowledged, sequenced, or retransmitted by OpenVPN because the higher level network protocols running on top of the tunnel such as TCP expect this role to be left to them.</p>

    <p>Renegotiate data channel key after <strong>n</strong> bytes sent or received (disabled by default).

  <dd>
    <p>Renegotiate data channel key after <strong>n</strong> seconds (default=3600).</p><p>When using dual-factor authentication, note that this default value may cause the end user to be challenged to reauthorize once per hour.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that this option can be used on both the client and server, and whichever uses the lower value will be the one to trigger the renegotiation. A common mistake is to set <strong>--reneg-sec</strong> to a higher value on either the client or server, while the other side of the connection is still using the default value of 3600 seconds, meaning that the renegotiation will still occur once per 3600 seconds.  The solution is to increase --reneg-sec on both the client and server, or set it to 0 on one side of the connection (to disable), and to your chosen value on the other side.</p>

    <p>Handshake Window -- the TLS-based key exchange must finalize within <strong>n</strong> seconds of handshake initiation by any peer (default = 60 seconds). If the handshake fails we will attempt to reset our connection with our peer and try again.

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Add an additional layer of HMAC authentication on top of the TLS control channel to protect against DoS attacks.</p><p>In a nutshell, <strong>--tls-auth</strong> enables a kind of "HMAC firewall" on OpenVPN's TCP/UDP port, where TLS control channel packets bearing an incorrect HMAC signature can be dropped immediately without response.</p><p><strong>file</strong> (required) is a key file which can be in one of two formats:</p><p><strong>(1)</strong> An OpenVPN static key file generated by <strong>--genkey</strong> (required if <strong>direction</strong> parameter is used).</p><p><strong>(2)</strong> A freeform passphrase file.  In this case the HMAC key will be derived by taking a secure hash of this file, similar to the <a href="../man1/md5sum.1.html"><strong>md5sum</strong>(1)</a> or <a href="../man1/sha1sum.1.html"><strong>sha1sum</strong>(1)</a> commands.</p><p>OpenVPN will first try format (1), and if the file fails to parse as a static key file, format (2) will be used.</p><p>See the <strong>--secret</strong> option for more information on the optional <strong>direction</strong> parameter.</p><p><strong>--tls-auth</strong> is recommended when you are running OpenVPN in a mode where it is listening for packets from any IP address, such as when <strong>--remote</strong> is not specified, or <strong>--remote</strong> is specified with <strong>--float.</strong></p><p>The rationale for this feature is as follows.  TLS requires a multi-packet exchange before it is able to authenticate a peer.  During this time before authentication, OpenVPN is allocating resources (memory and CPU) to this potential peer.  The potential peer is also exposing many parts of OpenVPN and the OpenSSL library to the packets it is sending.  Most successful network attacks today seek to either exploit bugs in programs (such as buffer overflow attacks) or force a program to consume so many resources that it becomes unusable. Of course the first line of defense is always to produce clean, well-audited code.  OpenVPN has been written with buffer overflow attack prevention as a top priority. But as history has shown, many of the most widely used network applications have, from time to time, fallen to buffer overflow attacks.</p><p>So as a second line of defense, OpenVPN offers this special layer of authentication on top of the TLS control channel so that every packet on the control channel is authenticated by an HMAC signature and a unique ID for replay protection. This signature will also help protect against DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. An important rule of thumb in reducing vulnerability to DoS attacks is to minimize the amount of resources a potential, but as yet unauthenticated, client is able to consume.</p><p><strong>--tls-auth</strong> does this by signing every TLS control channel packet with an HMAC signature, including packets which are sent before the TLS level has had a chance to authenticate the peer. The result is that packets without the correct signature can be dropped immediately upon reception, before they have a chance to consume additional system resources such as by initiating a TLS handshake. <strong>--tls-auth</strong> can be strengthened by adding the <strong>--replay-persist</strong> option which will keep OpenVPN's replay protection state in a file so that it is not lost across restarts.</p><p>It should be emphasized that this feature is optional and that the passphrase/key file used with <strong>--tls-auth</strong> gives a peer nothing more than the power to initiate a TLS handshake.  It is not used to encrypt or authenticate any tunnel data.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Get certificate password from console or <strong>file</strong> before we daemonize.</p><p>For the extremely security conscious, it is possible to protect your private key with a password.  Of course this means that every time the OpenVPN daemon is started you must be there to type the password.  The <strong>--askpass</strong> option allows you to start OpenVPN from the command line.  It will query you for a password before it daemonizes.  To protect a private key with a password you should omit the <strong>-nodes</strong> option when you use the <strong>openssl</strong> command line tool to manage certificates and private keys.</p><p>If <strong>file</strong> is specified, read the password from the first line of <strong>file.</strong> Keep in mind that storing your password in a file to a certain extent invalidates the extra security provided by using an encrypted key (Note: OpenVPN will only read passwords from a file if it has been built with the --enable-password-save configure option, or on Windows by defining ENABLE_PASSWORD_SAVE in win/settings.in).</p>

This feature allows you to write a script which will test the X509 name on a certificate and decide whether or not it should be accepted.

<h3>TUN/TAP persistent tunnel config mode:</h3>
<p>Available with linux 2.4.7+.  These options comprise a standalone mode of OpenVPN which can be used to create and delete persistent tunnels.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--mktun</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(Standalone) Create a persistent tunnel on platforms which support them such as Linux.  Normally TUN/TAP tunnels exist only for the period of time that an application has them open.  This option takes advantage of the TUN/TAP driver's ability to build persistent tunnels that live through multiple instantiations of OpenVPN and die only when they are deleted or the machine is rebooted.</p><p>One of the advantages of persistent tunnels is that they eliminate the need for separate <strong>--up</strong> and <strong>--down</strong> scripts to run the appropriate <a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html"><strong>ifconfig</strong>(8)</a> and <a href="../man8/route.8.html"><strong>route</strong>(8)</a> commands.  These commands can be placed in the the same shell script which starts or terminates an OpenVPN session.</p><p>Another advantage is that open connections through the TUN/TAP-based tunnel will not be reset if the OpenVPN peer restarts.  This can be useful to provide uninterrupted connectivity through the tunnel in the event of a DHCP reset of the peer's public IP address (see the <strong>--ipchange</strong> option above).</p><p>One disadvantage of persistent tunnels is that it is harder to automatically configure their MTU value (see <strong>--link-mtu</strong> and <strong>--tun-mtu</strong> above).</p><p>On some platforms such as Windows, TAP-Win32 tunnels are persistent by default.</p>

<h3>Windows-Specific Options:</h3>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--win-sys path</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the Windows system directory pathname to use when looking for system executables such as <strong>route.exe</strong> and <strong>netsh.exe.</strong> By default, if this directive is not specified, OpenVPN will use the SystemRoot environment variable.</p><p>This option have changed behaviour in OpenVPN 2.3.  Earlier you had to define <strong>--win-sys env</strong> to use the SystemRoot environment variable, otherwise it defaulted to C:&#92;WINDOWS. It is not needed to use the <strong>env</strong> keyword any more, and it will just be ignored. A warning is logged when this is found in the configuration file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--ip-win32 method</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When using <strong>--ifconfig</strong> on Windows, set the TAP-Win32 adapter IP address and netmask using <strong>method.</strong> Don't use this option unless you are also using <strong>--ifconfig.</strong></p><p><strong>manual --</strong> Don't set the IP address or netmask automatically. Instead output a message to the console telling the user to configure the adapter manually and indicating the IP/netmask which OpenVPN expects the adapter to be set to.</p><p><strong>dynamic [offset] [lease-time] --</strong> Automatically set the IP address and netmask by replying to DHCP query messages generated by the kernel.  This mode is probably the "cleanest" solution for setting the TCP/IP properties since it uses the well-known DHCP protocol.  There are, however, two prerequisites for using this mode: (1) The TCP/IP properties for the TAP-Win32 adapter must be set to "Obtain an IP address automatically," and (2) OpenVPN needs to claim an IP address in the subnet for use as the virtual DHCP server address.  By default in <strong>--dev tap</strong> mode, OpenVPN will take the normally unused first address in the subnet.  For example, if your subnet is 192.168.4.0 netmask 255.255.255.0, then OpenVPN will take the IP address 192.168.4.0 to use as the virtual DHCP server address.  In <strong>--dev tun</strong> mode, OpenVPN will cause the DHCP server to masquerade as if it were coming from the remote endpoint.  The optional offset parameter is an integer which is &gt; -256 and &lt; 256 and which defaults to 0. If offset is positive, the DHCP server will masquerade as the IP address at network address + offset. If offset is negative, the DHCP server will masquerade as the IP address at broadcast address + offset.  The Windows <strong>ipconfig /all</strong> command can be used to show what Windows thinks the DHCP server address is.  OpenVPN will "claim" this address, so make sure to use a free address.  Having said that, different OpenVPN instantiations, including different ends of the same connection, can share the same virtual DHCP server address.  The <strong>lease-time</strong> parameter controls the lease time of the DHCP assignment given to the TAP-Win32 adapter, and is denoted in seconds. Normally a very long lease time is preferred because it prevents routes involving the TAP-Win32 adapter from being lost when the system goes to sleep.  The default lease time is one year.</p><p><strong>netsh --</strong> Automatically set the IP address and netmask using the Windows command-line "netsh" command.  This method appears to work correctly on Windows XP but not Windows 2000.</p><p><strong>ipapi --</strong> Automatically set the IP address and netmask using the Windows IP Helper API.  This approach does not have ideal semantics, though testing has indicated that it works okay in practice.  If you use this option, it is best to leave the TCP/IP properties for the TAP-Win32 adapter in their default state, i.e. "Obtain an IP address automatically."</p><p><strong>adaptive --</strong> (Default) Try <strong>dynamic</strong> method initially and fail over to <strong>netsh</strong> if the DHCP negotiation with the TAP-Win32 adapter does not succeed in 20 seconds.  Such failures have been known to occur when certain third-party firewall packages installed on the client machine block the DHCP negotiation used by the TAP-Win32 adapter. Note that if the <strong>netsh</strong> failover occurs, the TAP-Win32 adapter TCP/IP properties will be reset from DHCP to static, and this will cause future OpenVPN startups using the <strong>adaptive</strong> mode to use <strong>netsh</strong> immediately, rather than trying <strong>dynamic</strong> first.  To "unstick" the <strong>adaptive</strong> mode from using <strong>netsh,</strong> run OpenVPN at least once using the <strong>dynamic</strong> mode to restore the TAP-Win32 adapter TCP/IP properties to a DHCP configuration.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--route-method m</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Which method <strong>m</strong> to use for adding routes on Windows?</p><p><strong>adaptive</strong> (default) -- Try IP helper API first.  If that fails, fall back to the route.exe shell command.</p><p><strong>ipapi</strong> -- Use IP helper API.</p><p><strong>exe</strong> -- Call the route.exe shell command.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--dhcp-option type [parm]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set extended TAP-Win32 TCP/IP properties, must be used with <strong>--ip-win32 dynamic</strong> or <strong>--ip-win32 adaptive.</strong> This option can be used to set additional TCP/IP properties on the TAP-Win32 adapter, and is particularly useful for configuring an OpenVPN client to access a Samba server across the VPN.</p><p><strong>DOMAIN name --</strong> Set Connection-specific DNS Suffix.</p><p><strong>DNS addr --</strong> Set primary domain name server address.  Repeat this option to set secondary DNS server addresses.</p><p><strong>WINS addr --</strong> Set primary WINS server address (NetBIOS over TCP/IP Name Server). Repeat this option to set secondary WINS server addresses.</p><p><strong>NBDD addr --</strong> Set primary NBDD server address (NetBIOS over TCP/IP Datagram Distribution Server) Repeat this option to set secondary NBDD server addresses.</p><p><strong>NTP addr --</strong> Set primary NTP server address (Network Time Protocol). Repeat this option to set secondary NTP server addresses.</p><p><strong>NBT type --</strong> Set NetBIOS over TCP/IP Node type.  Possible options: <strong>1</strong> = b-node (broadcasts), <strong>2</strong> = p-node (point-to-point name queries to a WINS server), <strong>4</strong> = m-node (broadcast then query name server), and <strong>8</strong> = h-node (query name server, then broadcast).</p><p><strong>NBS scope-id --</strong> Set NetBIOS over TCP/IP Scope. A NetBIOS Scope ID provides an extended naming service for the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (Known as NBT) module. The primary purpose of a NetBIOS scope ID is to isolate NetBIOS traffic on a single network to only those nodes with the same NetBIOS scope ID. The NetBIOS scope ID is a character string that is appended to the NetBIOS name. The NetBIOS scope ID on two hosts must match, or the two hosts will not be able to communicate. The NetBIOS Scope ID also allows computers to use the same computer name, as they have different scope IDs. The Scope ID becomes a part of the NetBIOS name, making the name unique. (This description of NetBIOS scopes courtesy of NeonSurge@abyss.com)</p><p><strong>DISABLE-NBT --</strong> Disable Netbios-over-TCP/IP.</p><p>Note that if <strong>--dhcp-option</strong> is pushed via <strong>--push</strong> to a non-windows client, the option will be saved in the client's environment before the up script is called, under the name "foreign_option_{n}".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--tap-sleep n</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Cause OpenVPN to sleep for <strong>n</strong> seconds immediately after the TAP-Win32 adapter state is set to "connected".</p><p>This option is intended to be used to troubleshoot problems with the <strong>--ifconfig</strong> and <strong>--ip-win32</strong> options, and is used to give the TAP-Win32 adapter time to come up before Windows IP Helper API operations are applied to it.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--show-net-up</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Output OpenVPN's view of the system routing table and network adapter list to the syslog or log file after the TUN/TAP adapter has been brought up and any routes have been added.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--dhcp-renew</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Ask Windows to renew the TAP adapter lease on startup. This option is normally unnecessary, as Windows automatically triggers a DHCP renegotiation on the TAP adapter when it comes up, however if you set the TAP-Win32 adapter Media Status property to "Always Connected", you may need this flag.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--dhcp-release</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Ask Windows to release the TAP adapter lease on shutdown. This option has the same caveats as <strong>--dhcp-renew</strong> above.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--register-dns</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Run net stop dnscache, net start dnscache, ipconfig /flushdns and ipconfig /registerdns on connection initiation. This is known to kick Windows into recognizing pushed DNS servers.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--pause-exit</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Put up a "press any key to continue" message on the console prior to OpenVPN program exit.  This option is automatically used by the Windows explorer when OpenVPN is run on a configuration file using the right-click explorer menu.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--service exit-event [0|1]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Should be used when OpenVPN is being automatically executed by another program in such a context that no interaction with the user via display or keyboard is possible.  In general, end-users should never need to explicitly use this option, as it is automatically added by the OpenVPN service wrapper when a given OpenVPN configuration is being run as a service.</p><p><strong>exit-event</strong> is the name of a Windows global event object, and OpenVPN will continuously monitor the state of this event object and exit when it becomes signaled.</p><p>The second parameter indicates the initial state of <strong>exit-event</strong> and normally defaults to 0.</p><p>Multiple OpenVPN processes can be simultaneously executed with the same <strong>exit-event</strong> parameter.  In any case, the controlling process can signal <strong>exit-event,</strong> causing all such OpenVPN processes to exit.</p><p>When executing an OpenVPN process using the <strong>--service</strong> directive, OpenVPN will probably not have a console window to output status/error messages, therefore it is useful to use <strong>--log</strong> or <strong>--log-append</strong> to write these messages to a file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--show-adapters</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(Standalone) Show available TAP-Win32 adapters which can be selected using the <strong>--dev-node</strong> option.  On non-Windows systems, the <a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html"><strong>ifconfig</strong>(8)</a> command provides similar functionality.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>(Standalone) Set <strong>TAP-adapter</strong> to allow access from non-administrative accounts.  If <strong>TAP-adapter</strong> is omitted, all TAP adapters on the system will be configured to allow non-admin access. The non-admin access setting will only persist for the length of time that the TAP-Win32 device object and driver remain loaded, and will need to be re-enabled after a reboot, or if the driver is unloaded and reloaded. This directive can only be used by an administrator.</p>

<h3>String Types and Remapping</h3>
<p>In certain cases, OpenVPN will perform remapping of characters in strings.  Essentially, any characters outside the set of permitted characters for each string type will be converted to underbar ('_').</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Why is string remapping necessary?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> It's an important security feature to prevent the malicious coding of strings from untrusted sources to be passed as parameters to scripts, saved in the environment, used as a common name, translated to a filename, etc.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can string remapping be disabled?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, by using the <strong>--no-name-remapping</strong> option, however this should be considered an advanced option.</p><p>Here is a brief rundown of OpenVPN's current string types and the permitted character class for each string:</p><p><strong>X509 Names:</strong> Alphanumeric, underbar ('_'), dash ('-'), dot ('.'), at ('@'), colon (':'), slash ('/'), and equal ('=').  Alphanumeric is defined as a character which will cause the C library isalnum() function to return true.</p><p><strong>Common Names:</strong> Alphanumeric, underbar ('_'), dash ('-'), dot ('.'), and at ('@').</p><p><strong>--auth-user-pass username:</strong> Same as Common Name, with one exception: starting with OpenVPN 2.0.1, the username is passed to the OPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY plugin in its raw form, without string remapping.</p><p><strong>--auth-user-pass password:</strong> Any "printable" character except CR or LF. Printable is defined to be a character which will cause the C library isprint() function to return true.</p><p><strong>--client-config-dir filename as derived from common name or username:</strong> Alphanumeric, underbar ('_'), dash ('-'), and dot ('.') except for "." or ".." as standalone strings.  As of 2.0.1-rc6, the at ('@') character has been added as well for compatibility with the common name character class.</p><p><strong>Environmental variable names:</strong> Alphanumeric or underbar ('_').</p><p><strong>Environmental variable values:</strong> Any printable character.</p><p>For all cases, characters in a string which are not members of the legal character class for that string type will be remapped to underbar ('_').</p>
<h3>Environmental Variables</h3>
<p>Once set, a variable is persisted indefinitely until it is reset by a new value or a restart,</p><p>As of OpenVPN 2.0-beta12, in server mode, environmental variables set by OpenVPN are scoped according to the client objects they are associated with, so there should not be any issues with scripts having access to stale, previously set variables which refer to different client instances.</p>

Set prior to execution of <strong>--tls-verify</strong> script.  This variable is similar to <strong>tls_id_{n}</strong> except the component X509 subject fields are broken out, and no string remapping occurs on these field values (except for remapping of control characters to "_"). For example, the following variables would be set on the OpenVPN server using the sample client certificate in sample-keys (client.crt).

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>If you are running Linux 2.4.7 or higher, you probably have the TUN/TAP driver already installed.  If so, there are still a few things you need to do:</p><p>Make device: <strong>mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200</strong></p><p>Load driver: <strong>modprobe tun</strong></p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">EXAMPLES</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Prior to running these examples, you should have OpenVPN installed on two machines with network connectivity between them.  If you have not yet installed OpenVPN, consult the INSTALL file included in the OpenVPN distribution.</p><h3>TUN/TAP Setup:</h3>
<p>If you are using Linux 2.4 or higher, make the tun device node and load the tun module:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200</strong></p></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><p><strong>modprobe tun</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>If you installed from RPM, the <strong>mknod</strong> step may be omitted, because the RPM install does that for you.</p><p>Only Linux 2.4 and newer are supported.</p><p>For other platforms, consult the INSTALL file at <em>http://openvpn.net/install.html</em> for more information.</p>
<h3>Firewall Setup:</h3>
<p>If firewalls exist between the two machines, they should be set to forward UDP port 1194 in both directions.  If you do not have control over the firewalls between the two machines, you may still be able to use OpenVPN by adding <strong>--ping 15</strong> to each of the <strong>openvpn</strong> commands used below in the examples (this will cause each peer to send out a UDP ping to its remote peer once every 15 seconds which will cause many stateful firewalls to forward packets in both directions without an explicit firewall rule).</p><p>If you are using a Linux iptables-based firewall, you may need to enter the following command to allow incoming packets on the TUN device:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>See the firewalls section below for more information on configuring firewalls for use with OpenVPN.</p>
<h3>VPN Address Setup:</h3>
<p>For purposes of our example, our two machines will be called <strong>may.kg</strong> and <strong>june.kg.</strong> If you are constructing a VPN over the internet, then replace <strong>may.kg</strong> and <strong>june.kg</strong> with the internet hostname or IP address that each machine will use to contact the other over the internet.</p><p>Now we will choose the tunnel endpoints.  Tunnel endpoints are private IP addresses that only have meaning in the context of the VPN.  Each machine will use the tunnel endpoint of the other machine to access it over the VPN.  In our example, the tunnel endpoint for may.kg will be 10.4.0.1 and for june.kg, 10.4.0.2.</p><p>Once the VPN is established, you have essentially created a secure alternate path between the two hosts which is addressed by using the tunnel endpoints.  You can control which network traffic passes between the hosts (a) over the VPN or (b) independently of the VPN, by choosing whether to use (a) the VPN endpoint address or (b) the public internet address, to access the remote host. For example if you are on may.kg and you wish to connect to june.kg via <strong>ssh</strong> without using the VPN (since <strong>ssh</strong> has its own built-in security) you would use the command <strong>ssh june.kg.</strong> However in the same scenario, you could also use the command <strong>telnet 10.4.0.2</strong> to create a telnet session with june.kg over the VPN, that would use the VPN to secure the session rather than <strong>ssh.</strong></p><p>You can use any address you wish for the tunnel endpoints but make sure that they are private addresses (such as those that begin with 10 or 192.168) and that they are not part of any existing subnet on the networks of either peer, unless you are bridging.  If you use an address that is part of your local subnet for either of the tunnel endpoints, you will get a weird feedback loop.</p>
<h3>Example 1: A simple tunnel without security</h3>
<p>On may:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>openvpn --remote june.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.1 10.4.0.2 --verb 9</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>On june:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>openvpn --remote may.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.2 10.4.0.1 --verb 9</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>Now verify the tunnel is working by pinging across the tunnel.</p><p>On may:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>ping 10.4.0.2</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>On june:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>ping 10.4.0.1</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>The <strong>--verb 9</strong> option will produce verbose output, similar to the <a href="../man8/tcpdump.8.html"><strong>tcpdump</strong>(8)</a> program.  Omit the <strong>--verb 9</strong> option to have OpenVPN run quietly.</p>
<h3>Example 2: A tunnel with static-key security (i.e. using a pre-shared secret)</h3>
<p>First build a static key on may.</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>openvpn --genkey --secret key</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>This command will build a random key file called <strong>key</strong> (in ascii format). Now copy <strong>key</strong> to june over a secure medium such as by using the <strong>scp</strong>(1) program.</p><p>On may:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>openvpn --remote june.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.1 10.4.0.2 --verb 5 --secret key</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>On june:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>openvpn --remote may.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.2 10.4.0.1 --verb 5 --secret key</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>Now verify the tunnel is working by pinging across the tunnel.</p><p>On may:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>ping 10.4.0.2</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>On june:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>ping 10.4.0.1</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example 3: A tunnel with full TLS-based security</h3>
<p>For this test, we will designate <strong>may</strong> as the TLS client and <strong>june</strong> as the TLS server. <em>Note that client or server designation only has meaning for the TLS subsystem. It has no bearing on OpenVPN's peer-to-peer, UDP-based communication model.</em></p><p>First, build a separate certificate/key pair for both may and june (see above where <strong>--cert</strong> is discussed for more info).  Then construct Diffie Hellman parameters (see above where <strong>--dh</strong> is discussed for more info).  You can also use the included test files client.crt, client.key, server.crt, server.key and ca.crt. The .crt files are certificates/public-keys, the .key files are private keys, and ca.crt is a certification authority who has signed both client.crt and server.crt.  For Diffie Hellman parameters you can use the included file dh1024.pem. <em>Note that all client, server, and certificate authority certificates and keys included in the OpenVPN distribution are totally insecure and should be used for testing only.</em></p><p>On may:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>openvpn --remote june.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.1 10.4.0.2 --tls-client --ca ca.crt --cert client.crt --key client.key --reneg-sec 60 --verb 5</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>On june:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>openvpn --remote may.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.2 10.4.0.1 --tls-server --dh dh1024.pem --ca ca.crt --cert server.crt --key server.key --reneg-sec 60 --verb 5</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>Now verify the tunnel is working by pinging across the tunnel.</p><p>On may:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>ping 10.4.0.2</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>On june:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>ping 10.4.0.1</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>Notice the <strong>--reneg-sec 60</strong> option we used above.  That tells OpenVPN to renegotiate the data channel keys every minute. Since we used <strong>--verb 5</strong> above, you will see status information on each new key negotiation.</p><p>For production operations, a key renegotiation interval of 60 seconds is probably too frequent.  Omit the <strong>--reneg-sec 60</strong> option to use OpenVPN's default key renegotiation interval of one hour.</p>
<h3>Routing:</h3>
<p>Assuming you can ping across the tunnel, the next step is to route a real subnet over the secure tunnel.  Suppose that may and june have two network interfaces each, one connected to the internet, and the other to a private network.  Our goal is to securely connect both private networks.  We will assume that may's private subnet is 10.0.0.0/24 and june's is 10.0.1.0/24.</p><p>First, ensure that IP forwarding is enabled on both peers. On Linux, enable routing:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>and enable TUN packet forwarding through the firewall:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>On may:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>route add -net 10.0.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.4.0.2</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>On june:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.4.0.1</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>Now any machine on the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet can access any machine on the 10.0.1.0/24 subnet over the secure tunnel (or vice versa).</p><p>In a production environment, you could put the route command(s) in a script and execute with the <strong>--up</strong> option.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">FIREWALLS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>OpenVPN's usage of a single UDP port makes it fairly firewall-friendly. You should add an entry to your firewall rules to allow incoming OpenVPN packets.  On Linux 2.4+:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>iptables -A INPUT -p udp -s 1.2.3.4 --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>This will allow incoming packets on UDP port 1194 (OpenVPN's default UDP port) from an OpenVPN peer at 1.2.3.4.</p><p>If you are using HMAC-based packet authentication (the default in any of OpenVPN's secure modes), having the firewall filter on source address can be considered optional, since HMAC packet authentication is a much more secure method of verifying the authenticity of a packet source.  In that case:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>would be adequate and would not render the host inflexible with respect to its peer having a dynamic IP address.</p><p>OpenVPN also works well on stateful firewalls.  In some cases, you may not need to add any static rules to the firewall list if you are using a stateful firewall that knows how to track UDP connections. If you specify <strong>--ping n,</strong> OpenVPN will be guaranteed to send a packet to its peer at least once every <strong>n</strong> seconds.  If <strong>n</strong> is less than the stateful firewall connection timeout, you can maintain an OpenVPN connection indefinitely without explicit firewall rules.</p><p>You should also add firewall rules to allow incoming IP traffic on TUN or TAP devices such as:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>to allow input packets from tun devices,</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>to allow input packets from tun devices to be forwarded to other hosts on the local network,</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>iptables -A INPUT -i tap+ -j ACCEPT</strong></p></li>
