<p><strong>pppd</strong> [ <em>options</em> ]</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>PPP is the protocol used for establishing internet links over dial-up modems, DSL connections, and many other types of point-to-point links.  The <em>pppd</em> daemon works together with the kernel PPP driver to establish and maintain a PPP link with another system (called the <em>peer</em>) and to negotiate Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for each end of the link.  Pppd can also authenticate the peer and/or supply authentication information to the peer.  PPP can be used with other network protocols besides IP, but such use is becoming increasingly rare.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">FREQUENTLY USED OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>ttyname</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use the serial port called <em>ttyname</em> to communicate with the peer.  If <em>ttyname</em> does not begin with a slash (/), the string "/dev/" is prepended to <em>ttyname</em> to form the name of the device to open.  If no device name is given, or if the name of the terminal connected to the standard input is given, pppd will use that terminal, and will not fork to put itself in the background.  A value for this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>speed</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>An option that is a decimal number is taken as the desired baud rate for the serial device.  On systems such as 4.4BSD and NetBSD, any speed can be specified.  Other systems (e.g. Linux, SunOS) only support the commonly-used baud rates.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>asyncmap </strong><em>map</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option sets the Async-Control-Character-Map (ACCM) for this end of the link.  The ACCM is a set of 32 bits, one for each of the ASCII control characters with values from 0 to 31, where a 1 bit indicates that the corresponding control character should not be used in PPP packets sent to this system.  The map is encoded as a hexadecimal number (without a leading 0x) where the least significant bit (00000001) represents character 0 and the most significant bit (80000000) represents character 31. Pppd will ask the peer to send these characters as a 2-byte escape sequence. If multiple <em>asyncmap</em> options are given, the values are ORed together.  If no <em>asyncmap</em> option is given, the default is zero, so pppd will ask the peer not to escape any control characters. To escape transmitted characters, use the <em>escape</em> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>auth</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Require the peer to authenticate itself before allowing network packets to be sent or received.  This option is the default if the system has a default route.  If neither this option nor the <em>noauth</em> option is specified, pppd will only allow the peer to use IP addresses to which the system does not already have a route.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>call </strong><em>name</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Read additional options from the file /etc/ppp/peers/<em>name</em>.  This file may contain privileged options, such as <em>noauth</em>, even if pppd is not being run by root.  The <em>name</em> string may not begin with / or include .. as a pathname component.  The format of the options file is described below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>connect </strong><em>script</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Usually there is something which needs to be done to prepare the link before the PPP protocol can be started; for instance, with a dial-up modem, commands need to be sent to the modem to dial the appropriate phone number.  This option specifies an command for pppd to execute (by passing it to a shell) before attempting to start PPP negotiation. The chat (8) program is often useful here, as it provides a way to send arbitrary strings to a modem and respond to received characters. A value for this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>crtscts</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies that pppd should set the serial port to use hardware flow control using the RTS and CTS signals in the RS-232 interface. If neither the <em>crtscts</em>, the <em>nocrtscts</em>, the <em>cdtrcts</em> nor the <em>nocdtrcts</em> option is given, the hardware flow control setting for the serial port is left unchanged. Some serial ports (such as Macintosh serial ports) lack a true RTS output. Such serial ports use this mode to implement unidirectional flow control. The serial port will suspend transmission when requested by the modem (via CTS) but will be unable to request the modem to stop sending to the computer. This mode retains the ability to use DTR as a modem control line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>defaultroute</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Add a default route to the system routing tables, using the peer as the gateway, when IPCP negotiation is successfully completed. This entry is removed when the PPP connection is broken.  This option is privileged if the <em>nodefaultroute</em> option has been specified.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>replacedefaultroute</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option is a flag to the defaultroute option. If defaultroute is set and this flag is also set, pppd replaces an existing default route with the new default route.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>disconnect </strong><em>script</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Execute the command specified by <em>script</em>, by passing it to a shell, after pppd has terminated the link.  This command could, for example, issue commands to the modem to cause it to hang up if hardware modem control signals were not available.  The disconnect script is not run if the modem has already hung up.  A value for this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>escape </strong><em>xx,yy,...</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies that certain characters should be escaped on transmission (regardless of whether the peer requests them to be escaped with its async control character map).  The characters to be escaped are specified as a list of hex numbers separated by commas.  Note that almost any character can be specified for the <em>escape</em> option, unlike the <em>asyncmap</em> option which only allows control characters to be specified.  The characters which may not be escaped are those with hex values 0x20 - 0x3f or 0x5e.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>file </strong><em>name</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Read options from file <em>name</em> (the format is described below). The file must be readable by the user who has invoked pppd.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>init </strong><em>script</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Execute the command specified by <em>script</em>, by passing it to a shell, to initialize the serial line.  This script would typically use the <a href="../man8/chat.8.html"><strong>chat</strong>(8)</a> program to configure the modem to enable auto answer.  A value for this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>lock</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies that pppd should create a UUCP-style lock file for the serial device to ensure exclusive access to the device.  By default, pppd will not create a lock file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>mru </strong><em>n</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] value to <em>n</em>. Pppd will ask the peer to send packets of no more than <em>n</em> bytes. The value of <em>n</em> must be between 128 and 16384; the default is 1500. A value of 296 works well on very slow links (40 bytes for TCP/IP header + 256 bytes of data). Note that for the IPv6 protocol, the MRU must be at least 1280.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>mtu </strong><em>n</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the MTU [Maximum Transmit Unit] value to <em>n</em>.  Unless the peer requests a smaller value via MRU negotiation, pppd will request that the kernel networking code send data packets of no more than <em>n</em> bytes through the PPP network interface.  Note that for the IPv6 protocol, the MTU must be at least 1280.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>passive</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enables the "passive" option in the LCP.  With this option, pppd will attempt to initiate a connection; if no reply is received from the peer, pppd will then just wait passively for a valid LCP packet from the peer, instead of exiting, as it would without this option.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>&lt;local_IP_address&gt;</em><strong>:</strong><em>&lt;remote_IP_address&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the local and/or remote interface IP addresses.  Either one may be omitted.  The IP addresses can be specified with a host name or in decimal dot notation (e.g. 150.234.56.78).  The default local address is the (first) IP address of the system (unless the <em>noipdefault</em> option is given).  The remote address will be obtained from the peer if not specified in any option.  Thus, in simple cases, this option is not required.  If a local and/or remote IP address is specified with this option, pppd will not accept a different value from the peer in the IPCP negotiation, unless the <em>ipcp-accept-local</em> and/or <em>ipcp-accept-remote</em> options are given, respectively.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>+ipv6</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable the IPv6CP and IPv6 protocols.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ipv6 </strong><em>&lt;local_interface_identifier&gt;</em>,<em>&lt;remote_interface_identifier&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the local and/or remote 64-bit interface identifier. Either one may be omitted. The identifier must be specified in standard ASCII notation of IPv6 addresses (e.g. ::dead:beef). If the <em>ipv6cp-use-ipaddr</em> option is given, the local identifier is the local IPv4 address (see above). On systems which supports a unique persistent id, such as EUI-48 derived from the Ethernet MAC address, <em>ipv6cp-use-persistent</em> option can be used to replace the <em>ipv6 &lt;local&gt;,&lt;remote&gt;</em> option. Otherwise the identifier is randomized.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>active-filter </strong><em>filter-expression</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies a packet filter to be applied to data packets to determine which packets are to be regarded as link activity, and therefore reset the idle timer, or cause the link to be brought up in demand-dialling mode.  This option is useful in conjunction with the <strong>idle</strong> option if there are packets being sent or received regularly over the link (for example, routing information packets) which would otherwise prevent the link from ever appearing to be idle. The <em>filter-expression</em> syntax is as described for <strong>tcpdump</strong>(1), except that qualifiers which are inappropriate for a PPP link, such as <strong>ether</strong> and <strong>arp</strong>, are not permitted.  Generally the filter expression should be enclosed in single-quotes to prevent whitespace in the expression from being interpreted by the shell. This option is currently only available under Linux, and requires that the kernel was configured to include PPP filtering support (CONFIG_PPP_FILTER). Note that it is possible to apply different constraints to incoming and outgoing packets using the <strong>inbound</strong> and <strong>outbound</strong> qualifiers.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>allow-ip </strong><em>address(es)</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Allow peers to use the given IP address or subnet without authenticating themselves.  The parameter is parsed as for each element of the list of allowed IP addresses in the secrets files (see the AUTHENTICATION section below).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>allow-number </strong><em>number</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Allow peers to connect from the given telephone number.  A trailing `*' character will match all numbers beginning with the leading part.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bsdcomp </strong><em>nr,nt</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using the BSD-Compress scheme, with a maximum code size of <em>nr</em> bits, and agree to compress packets sent to the peer with a maximum code size of <em>nt</em> bits.  If <em>nt</em> is not specified, it defaults to the value given for <em>nr</em>.  Values in the range 9 to 15 may be used for <em>nr</em> and <em>nt</em>; larger values give better compression but consume more kernel memory for compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a value of 0 for <em>nr</em> or <em>nt</em> disables compression in the corresponding direction.  Use <em>nobsdcomp</em> or <em>bsdcomp 0</em> to disable BSD-Compress compression entirely.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>cdtrcts</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use a non-standard hardware flow control (i.e. DTR/CTS) to control the flow of data on the serial port.  If neither the <em>crtscts</em>, the <em>nocrtscts</em>, the <em>cdtrcts</em> nor the <em>nocdtrcts</em> option is given, the hardware flow control setting for the serial port is left unchanged. Some serial ports (such as Macintosh serial ports) lack a true RTS output. Such serial ports use this mode to implement true bi-directional flow control. The sacrifice is that this flow control mode does not permit using DTR as a modem control line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>chap-interval </strong><em>n</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this option is given, pppd will rechallenge the peer every <em>n</em> seconds.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>chap-max-challenge </strong><em>n</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the maximum number of CHAP challenge transmissions to <em>n</em> (default 10).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>chap-restart </strong><em>n</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the CHAP restart interval (retransmission timeout for challenges) to <em>n</em> seconds (default 3).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>child-timeout </strong><em>n</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When exiting, wait for up to <em>n</em> seconds for any child processes (such as the command specified with the <strong>pty</strong> command) to exit before exiting.  At the end of the timeout, pppd will send a SIGTERM signal to any remaining child processes and exit.  A value of 0 means no timeout, that is, pppd will wait until all child processes have exited.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>connect-delay </strong><em>n</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Wait for up to <em>n</em> milliseconds after the connect script finishes for a valid PPP packet from the peer.  At the end of this time, or when a valid PPP packet is received from the peer, pppd will commence negotiation by sending its first LCP packet.  The default value is 1000 (1 second).  This wait period only applies if the <strong>connect</strong> or <strong>pty</strong> option is used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>debug</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enables connection debugging facilities. If this option is given, pppd will log the contents of all control packets sent or received in a readable form.  The packets are logged through syslog with facility <em>daemon</em> and level <em>debug</em>.  This information can be directed to a file by setting up /etc/syslog.conf appropriately (see <strong>syslog.conf</strong>(5)).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>default-asyncmap</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Disable asyncmap negotiation, forcing all control characters to be escaped for both the transmit and the receive direction.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>default-mru</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Disable MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] negotiation.  With this option, pppd will use the default MRU value of 1500 bytes for both the transmit and receive direction.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>deflate </strong><em>nr,nt</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using the Deflate scheme, with a maximum window size of <em>2**nr</em> bytes, and agree to compress packets sent to the peer with a maximum window size of <em>2**nt</em> bytes.  If <em>nt</em> is not specified, it defaults to the value given for <em>nr</em>.  Values in the range 9 to 15 may be used for <em>nr</em> and <em>nt</em>; larger values give better compression but consume more kernel memory for compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a value of 0 for <em>nr</em> or <em>nt</em> disables compression in the corresponding direction.  Use <em>nodeflate</em> or <em>deflate 0</em> to disable Deflate compression entirely.  (Note: pppd requests Deflate compression in preference to BSD-Compress if the peer can do either.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>demand</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Initiate the link only on demand, i.e. when data traffic is present. With this option, the remote IP address may be specified by the user on the command line or in an options file, or if not, pppd will use an arbitrary address in the 10.x.x.x range.  Pppd will initially configure the interface and enable it for IP traffic without connecting to the peer.  When traffic is available, pppd will connect to the peer and perform negotiation, authentication, etc. When this is completed, pppd will commence passing data packets (i.e., IP packets) across the link.</p><p>The <em>demand</em> option implies the <em>persist</em> option.  If this behaviour is not desired, use the <em>nopersist</em> option after the <em>demand</em> option.  The <em>idle</em> and <em>holdoff</em> options are also useful in conjunction with the <em>demand</em> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>domain </strong><em>d</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Append the domain name <em>d</em> to the local host name for authentication purposes.  For example, if gethostname() returns the name porsche, but the fully qualified domain name is porsche.Quotron.COM, you could specify <em>domain Quotron.COM</em>.  Pppd would then use the name <em>porsche.Quotron.COM</em> for looking up secrets in the secrets file, and as the default name to send to the peer when authenticating itself to the peer.  This option is privileged.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>dryrun</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With the <strong>dryrun</strong> option, pppd will print out all the option values which have been set and then exit, after parsing the command line and options files and checking the option values, but before initiating the link.  The option values are logged at level info, and also printed to standard output unless the device on standard output is the device that pppd would be using to communicate with the peer.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>dump</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With the <strong>dump</strong> option, pppd will print out all the option values which have been set.  This option is like the <strong>dryrun</strong> option except that pppd proceeds as normal rather than exiting.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>enable-session</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enables session accounting via PAM or wtwp/wtmpx, as appropriate. When PAM is enabled, the PAM "account" and "session" module stacks determine behavior, and are enabled for all PPP authentication protocols.  When PAM is disabled, wtmp/wtmpx entries are recorded regardless of whether the peer name identifies a valid user on the local system, making peers visible in the <a href="../man1/last.1.html"><strong>last</strong>(1)</a> log.  This feature is automatically enabled when the pppd <strong>login</strong> option is used. Session accounting is disabled by default.</p>

    <p><strong>endpoint </strong><em>&lt;epdisc&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Sets the endpoint discriminator sent by the local machine to the peer during multilink negotiation to <em>&lt;epdisc&gt;</em>.  The default is to use the MAC address of the first ethernet interface on the system, if any, otherwise the IPv4 address corresponding to the hostname, if any, provided it is not in the multicast or locally-assigned IP address ranges, or the localhost address.  The endpoint discriminator can be the string <strong>null</strong> or of the form <em>type</em>:<em>value</em>, where type is a decimal number or one of the strings <strong>local</strong>, <strong>IP</strong>, <strong>MAC</strong>, <strong>magic</strong>, or <strong>phone</strong>.  The value is an IP address in dotted-decimal notation for the <strong>IP</strong> type, or a string of bytes in hexadecimal, separated by periods or colons for the other types.  For the MAC type, the value may also be the name of an ethernet or similar network interface.  This option is currently only available under Linux.</p>

    <p><strong>kdebug </strong><em>n</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable debugging code in the kernel-level PPP driver.  The argument values depend on the specific kernel driver, but in general a value of 1 will enable general kernel debug messages.  (Note that these messages are usually only useful for debugging the kernel driver itself.)  For the Linux 2.2.x kernel driver, the value is a sum of bits: 1 to enable general debug messages, 2 to request that the contents of received packets be printed, and 4 to request that the contents of transmitted packets be printed.  On most systems, messages printed by the kernel are logged by <strong>syslog</strong>(1) to a file as directed in the /etc/syslog.conf configuration file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ktune</strong></p>

    <p>If this option is given, pppd will presume the peer to be dead if <em>n</em> LCP echo-requests are sent without receiving a valid LCP echo-reply.  If this happens, pppd will terminate the connection.  Use of this option requires a non-zero value for the <em>lcp-echo-interval</em> parameter.  This option can be used to enable pppd to terminate after the physical connection has been broken (e.g., the modem has hung up) in situations where no hardware modem control lines are available.</p>

    <p><strong>linkname </strong><em>name</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Sets the logical name of the link to <em>name</em>.  Pppd will create a file named <strong>ppp-</strong><em>name</em><strong>.pid</strong> in /var/run (or /etc/ppp on some systems) containing its process ID.  This can be useful in determining which instance of pppd is responsible for the link to a given peer system.  This is a privileged option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>local</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Don't use the modem control lines.  With this option, pppd will ignore the state of the CD (Carrier Detect) signal from the modem and will not change the state of the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal.  This is the opposite of the <strong>modem</strong> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>logfd </strong><em>n</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Send log messages to file descriptor <em>n</em>.  Pppd will send log messages to at most one file or file descriptor (as well as sending the log messages to syslog), so this option and the <strong>logfile</strong> option are mutually exclusive.

  <dd>
    <p>Use the modem control lines.  This option is the default.  With this option, pppd will wait for the CD (Carrier Detect) signal from the modem to be asserted when opening the serial device (unless a connect script is specified), and it will drop the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal briefly when the connection is terminated and before executing the connect script.  On Ultrix, this option implies hardware flow control, as for the <em>crtscts</em> option.  This is the opposite of the <strong>local</strong> option.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the name of the local system for authentication purposes to <em>name</em>.  This is a privileged option.  With this option, pppd will use lines in the secrets files which have <em>name</em> as the second field when looking for a secret to use in authenticating the peer.  In addition, unless overridden with the <em>user</em> option, <em>name</em> will be used as the name to send to the peer when authenticating the local system to the peer.

    <p><strong>noremoteip</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Allow pppd to operate without having an IP address for the peer.  This option is only available under Linux.  Normally, pppd will request the peer's IP address, and if the peer does not supply it, pppd will use an arbitrary address in the 10.x.x.x subnet. With this option, if the peer does not supply its IP address, pppd will not ask the peer for it, and will not set the destination address of the ppp interface.  In this situation, the ppp interface can be used for routing by creating device routes, but the peer itself cannot be addressed directly for IP traffic.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>notty</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally, pppd requires a terminal device.  With this option, pppd will allocate itself a pseudo-tty master/slave pair and use the slave as its terminal device.  Pppd will create a child process to act as a `character shunt' to transfer characters between the pseudo-tty master and its standard input and output.  Thus pppd will transmit characters on its standard output and receive characters on its standard input even if they are not terminal devices.  This option increases the latency and CPU overhead of transferring data over the ppp interface as all of the characters sent and received must flow through the character shunt process.  An explicit device name may not be given if this option is used.</p>

    <p>Specifies a packet filter to applied to data packets being sent or received to determine which packets should be allowed to pass. Packets which are rejected by the filter are silently discarded.  This option can be used to prevent specific network daemons (such as routed) using up link bandwidth, or to provide a very basic firewall capability. The <em>filter-expression</em> syntax is as described for <strong>tcpdump</strong>(1), except that qualifiers which are inappropriate for a PPP link, such as <strong>ether</strong> and <strong>arp</strong>, are not permitted.  Generally the filter expression should be enclosed in single-quotes to prevent whitespace in the expression from being interpreted by the shell.  Note that it is possible to apply different constraints to incoming and outgoing packets using the <strong>inbound</strong> and <strong>outbound</strong> qualifiers. This option is currently only available under Linux, and requires that the kernel was configured to include PPP filtering support (CONFIG_PPP_FILTER).</p>

    <p>With this option, pppd will accept all control characters from the peer, including those marked in the receive asyncmap.  Without this option, pppd will discard those characters as specified in RFC1662. This option should only be needed if the peer is buggy.</p>

<p>Options can be taken from files as well as the command line.  Pppd reads options from the files /etc/ppp/options, ~/.ppprc and /etc/ppp/options.<em>ttyname</em> (in that order) before processing the options on the command line.  (In fact, the command-line options are scanned to find the terminal name before the options.<em>ttyname</em> file is read.)  In forming the name of the options.<em>ttyname</em> file, the initial /dev/ is removed from the terminal name, and any remaining / characters are replaced with dots.</p><p>An options file is parsed into a series of words, delimited by whitespace.

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><em>pppd</em> provides system administrators with sufficient access control that PPP access to a server machine can be provided to legitimate users without fear of compromising the security of the server or the network it's on.  This control is provided through restrictions on which IP addresses the peer may use, based on its authenticated identity (if any), and through restrictions on which options a non-privileged user may use.  Several of pppd's options are privileged, in particular those which permit potentially insecure configurations; these options are only accepted in files which are under the control of the system administrator, or if pppd is being run by root.</p><p>The default behaviour of pppd is to allow an unauthenticated peer to use a given IP address only if the system does not already have a route to that IP address.  For example, a system with a permanent connection to the wider internet will normally have a default route, and thus all peers will have to authenticate themselves in order to set up a connection.  On such a system, the <em>auth</em> option is the default.  On the other hand, a system where the PPP link is the only connection to the internet will not normally have a default route, so the peer will be able to use almost any IP address without authenticating itself.</p><p>As indicated above, some security-sensitive options are privileged, which means that they may not be used by an ordinary non-privileged user running a setuid-root pppd, either on the command line, in the user's ~/.ppprc file, or in an options file read using the <em>file</em> option.  Privileged options may be used in /etc/ppp/options file or in an options file read using the <em>call</em> option.  If pppd is being run by the root user, privileged options can be used without restriction.</p><p>When opening the device, pppd uses either the invoking user's user ID or the root UID (that is, 0), depending on whether the device name was specified by the user or the system administrator.  If the device name comes from a privileged source, that is, /etc/ppp/options or an options file read using the <em>call</em> option, pppd uses full root privileges when opening the device.  Thus, by creating an appropriate file under /etc/ppp/peers, the system administrator can allow users to establish a ppp connection via a device which they would not normally have permission to access.  Otherwise pppd uses the invoking user's real UID when opening the device.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">AUTHENTICATION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Authentication is the process whereby one peer convinces the other of its identity.  This involves the first peer sending its name to the other, together with some kind of secret information which could only come from the genuine authorized user of that name.  In such an exchange, we will call the first peer the "client" and the other the "server".  The client has a name by which it identifies itself to the server, and the server also has a name by which it identifies itself to the client.  Generally the genuine client shares some secret (or password) with the server, and authenticates itself by proving that it knows that secret.  Very often, the names used for authentication correspond to the internet hostnames of the peers, but this is not essential.</p><p>At present, pppd supports three authentication protocols: the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).  PAP involves the client sending its name and a cleartext password to the server to authenticate itself.  In contrast, the server initiates the CHAP authentication exchange by sending a challenge to the client (the challenge packet includes the server's name).  The client must respond with a response which includes its name plus a hash value derived from the shared secret and the challenge, in order to prove that it knows the secret.  EAP supports CHAP-style authentication, and also includes the SRP-SHA1 mechanism, which is resistant to dictionary-based attacks and does not require a cleartext password on the server side.</p><p>The PPP protocol, being symmetrical, allows both peers to require the other to authenticate itself.  In that case, two separate and independent authentication exchanges will occur.  The two exchanges could use different authentication protocols, and in principle, different names could be used in the two exchanges.</p><p>The default behaviour of pppd is to agree to authenticate if requested, and to not require authentication from the peer.  However, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself with a particular protocol if it has no secrets which could be used to do so.</p><p>Pppd stores secrets for use in authentication in secrets files (/etc/ppp/pap-secrets for PAP, /etc/ppp/chap-secrets for CHAP, MS-CHAP, MS-CHAPv2, and EAP MD5-Challenge, and /etc/ppp/srp-secrets for EAP SRP-SHA1). All secrets files have the same format.  The secrets files can contain secrets for pppd to use in authenticating itself to other systems, as well as secrets for pppd to use when authenticating other systems to itself.</p><p>Each line in a secrets file contains one secret.  A given secret is specific to a particular combination of client and server - it can only be used by that client to authenticate itself to that server. Thus each line in a secrets file has at least 3 fields: the name of the client, the name of the server, and the secret.  These fields may be followed by a list of the IP addresses that the specified client may use when connecting to the specified server.</p><p>A secrets file is parsed into words as for a options file, so the client name, server name and secrets fields must each be one word, with any embedded spaces or other special characters quoted or escaped.  Note that case is significant in the client and server names and in the secret.</p><p>If the secret starts with an `@', what follows is assumed to be the name of a file from which to read the secret.  A "*" as the client or server name matches any name.  When selecting a secret, pppd takes the best match, i.e.  the match with the fewest wildcards.</p><p>Any following words on the same line are taken to be a list of acceptable IP addresses for that client.  If there are only 3 words on the line, or if the first word is "-", then all IP addresses are disallowed.  To allow any address, use "*".  A word starting with "!" indicates that the specified address is <em>not</em> acceptable.  An address may be followed by "/" and a number <em>n</em>, to indicate a whole subnet, i.e. all addresses which have the same value in the most significant <em>n</em> bits.  In this form, the address may be followed by a plus sign ("+") to indicate that one address from the subnet is authorized, based on the ppp network interface unit number in use. In this case, the host part of the address will be set to the unit number plus one.</p><p>Thus a secrets file contains both secrets for use in authenticating other hosts, plus secrets which we use for authenticating ourselves to others.  When pppd is authenticating the peer (checking the peer's identity), it chooses a secret with the peer's name in the first field and the name of the local system in the second field.  The name of the local system defaults to the hostname, with the domain name appended if the <em>domain</em> option is used.  This default can be overridden with the <em>name</em> option, except when the <em>usehostname</em> option is used.  (For EAP SRP-SHA1, see the <strong>srp-entry</strong>(8) utility for generating proper validator entries to be used in the "secret" field.)</p><p>When pppd is choosing a secret to use in authenticating itself to the peer, it first determines what name it is going to use to identify itself to the peer.  This name can be specified by the user with the <em>user</em> option.  If this option is not used, the name defaults to the name of the local system, determined as described in the previous paragraph.  Then pppd looks for a secret with this name in the first field and the peer's name in the second field.  Pppd will know the name of the peer if CHAP or EAP authentication is being used, because the peer will have sent it in the challenge packet.  However, if PAP is being used, pppd will have to determine the peer's name from the options specified by the user.  The user can specify the peer's name directly with the <em>remotename</em> option.  Otherwise, if the remote IP address was specified by a name (rather than in numeric form), that name will be used as the peer's name.  Failing that, pppd will use the null string as the peer's name.</p><p>When authenticating the peer with PAP, the supplied password is first compared with the secret from the secrets file.  If the password doesn't match the secret, the password is encrypted using crypt() and checked against the secret again.  Thus secrets for authenticating the peer can be stored in encrypted form if desired.  If the <em>papcrypt</em> option is given, the first (unencrypted) comparison is omitted, for better security.</p><p>Furthermore, if the <em>login</em> option was specified, the username and password are also checked against the system password database.  Thus, the system administrator can set up the pap-secrets file to allow PPP access only to certain users, and to restrict the set of IP addresses that each user can use.  Typically, when using the <em>login</em> option, the secret in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets would be "", which will match any password supplied by the peer.  This avoids the need to have the same secret in two places.</p><p>Authentication must be satisfactorily completed before IPCP (or any other Network Control Protocol) can be started.  If the peer is required to authenticate itself, and fails to do so, pppd will terminated the link (by closing LCP).  If IPCP negotiates an unacceptable IP address for the remote host, IPCP will be closed.  IP packets can only be sent or received when IPCP is open.</p><p>In some cases it is desirable to allow some hosts which can't authenticate themselves to connect and use one of a restricted set of IP addresses, even when the local host generally requires authentication.  If the peer refuses to authenticate itself when requested, pppd takes that as equivalent to authenticating with PAP using the empty string for the username and password.  Thus, by adding a line to the pap-secrets file which specifies the empty string for the client and password, it is possible to allow restricted access to hosts which refuse to authenticate themselves.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">ROUTING</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>When IPCP negotiation is completed successfully, pppd will inform the kernel of the local and remote IP addresses for the ppp interface. This is sufficient to create a host route to the remote end of the link, which will enable the peers to exchange IP packets. Communication with other machines generally requires further modification to routing tables and/or ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) tables.  In most cases the <em>defaultroute</em> and/or <em>proxyarp</em> options are sufficient for this, but in some cases further intervention is required.  The /etc/ppp/ip-up script can be used for this.</p><p>Sometimes it is desirable to add a default route through the remote host, as in the case of a machine whose only connection to the Internet is through the ppp interface.  The <em>defaultroute</em> option causes pppd to create such a default route when IPCP comes up, and delete it when the link is terminated.</p><p>In some cases it is desirable to use proxy ARP, for example on a server machine connected to a LAN, in order to allow other hosts to communicate with the remote host.  The <em>proxyarp</em> option causes pppd to look for a network interface on the same subnet as the remote host (an interface supporting broadcast and ARP, which is up and not a point-to-point or loopback interface).  If found, pppd creates a permanent, published ARP entry with the IP address of the remote host and the hardware address of the network interface found.</p><p>When the <em>demand</em> option is used, the interface IP addresses have already been set at the point when IPCP comes up.  If pppd has not been able to negotiate the same addresses that it used to configure the interface (for example when the peer is an ISP that uses dynamic IP address assignment), pppd has to change the interface IP addresses to the negotiated addresses.  This may disrupt existing connections, and the use of demand dialling with peers that do dynamic IP address assignment is not recommended.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">MULTILINK</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Multilink PPP provides the capability to combine two or more PPP links between a pair of machines into a single `bundle', which appears as a single virtual PPP link which has the combined bandwidth of the individual links.  Currently, multilink PPP is only supported under Linux.</p><p>Pppd detects that the link it is controlling is connected to the same peer as another link using the peer's endpoint discriminator and the authenticated identity of the peer (if it authenticates itself).  The endpoint discriminator is a block of data which is hopefully unique for each peer.  Several types of data can be used, including locally-assigned strings of bytes, IP addresses, MAC addresses, randomly strings of bytes, or E-164 phone numbers.  The endpoint discriminator sent to the peer by pppd can be set using the endpoint option.</p><p>In some circumstances the peer may send no endpoint discriminator or a non-unique value.  The bundle option adds an extra string which is added to the peer's endpoint discriminator and authenticated identity when matching up links to be joined together in a bundle.  The bundle option can also be used to allow the establishment of multiple bundles between the local system and the peer.  Pppd uses a TDB database in /var/run/pppd2.tdb to match up links.</p><p>Assuming that multilink is enabled and the peer is willing to negotiate multilink, then when pppd is invoked to bring up the first link to the peer, it will detect that no other link is connected to the peer and create a new bundle, that is, another ppp network interface unit.  When another pppd is invoked to bring up another link to the peer, it will detect the existing bundle and join its link to it.</p><p>If the first link terminates (for example, because of a hangup or a received LCP terminate-request) the bundle is not destroyed unless there are no other links remaining in the bundle.  Rather than exiting, the first pppd keeps running after its link terminates, until all the links in the bundle have terminated.  If the first pppd receives a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal, it will destroy the bundle and send a SIGHUP to the pppd processes for each of the links in the bundle.  If the first pppd receives a SIGHUP signal, it will terminate its link but not the bundle.</p><p>Note: demand mode is not currently supported with multilink.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">EXAMPLES</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The following examples assume that the /etc/ppp/options file contains the <em>auth</em> option (as in the default /etc/ppp/options file in the ppp distribution).</p><p>Probably the most common use of pppd is to dial out to an ISP.  This can be done with a command such as</p><ul>
<li><p>pppd call isp</p></li>
</ul><p>where the /etc/ppp/peers/isp file is set up by the system administrator to contain something like this:</p><ul>
<li><p>ttyS0 19200 crtscts</p><p>connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chat-isp'</p><p>noauth</p></li>
</ul><p>In this example, we are using chat to dial the ISP's modem and go through any logon sequence required.  The /etc/ppp/chat-isp file contains the script used by chat; it could for example contain something like this:</p><ul>
<li><p>ABORT "NO CARRIER"</p><p>ABORT "NO DIALTONE"</p><p>ABORT "ERROR"</p><p>ABORT "NO ANSWER"</p><p>ABORT "BUSY"</p><p>ABORT "Username/Password Incorrect"</p><p>"" "at"</p><p>OK "at&d0&c1"</p><p>OK "atdt2468135"</p><p>"name:" "^Umyuserid"</p><p>"word:" "&#92;qmypassword"</p><p>"ispts" "&#92;q^Uppp"</p><p>"~-^Uppp-~"</p></li>
</ul><p>See the <a href="../man8/chat.8.html"><strong>chat</strong>(8)</a> man page for details of chat scripts.</p><p>Pppd can also be used to provide a dial-in ppp service for users.  If the users already have login accounts, the simplest way to set up the ppp service is to let the users log in to their accounts and run pppd (installed setuid-root) with a command such as</p><ul>
<li><p>pppd proxyarp</p></li>
</ul><p>To allow a user to use the PPP facilities, you need to allocate an IP address for that user's machine and create an entry in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets, /etc/ppp/chap-secrets, or /etc/ppp/srp-secrets (depending on which authentication method the PPP implementation on the user's machine supports), so that the user's machine can authenticate itself.  For example, if Joe has a machine called "joespc" that is to be allowed to dial in to the machine called "server" and use the IP address joespc.my.net, you would add an entry like this to /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets:</p><ul>
<li><p>joespc	server	"joe's secret"	joespc.my.net</p></li>
</ul><p>(See <strong>srp-entry</strong>(8) for a means to generate the server's entry when SRP-SHA1 is in use.) Alternatively, you can create a username called (for example) "ppp", whose login shell is pppd and whose home directory is /etc/ppp. Options to be used when pppd is run this way can be put in /etc/ppp/.ppprc.</p><p>If your serial connection is any more complicated than a piece of wire, you may need to arrange for some control characters to be escaped.  In particular, it is often useful to escape XON (^Q) and XOFF (^S), using <em>asyncmap a0000</em>.  If the path includes a telnet, you probably should escape ^] as well (<em>asyncmap 200a0000</em>).  If the path includes an rlogin, you will need to use the <em>escape ff</em> option on the end which is running the rlogin client, since many rlogin implementations are not transparent; they will remove the sequence [0xff, 0xff, 0x73, 0x73, followed by any 8 bytes] from the stream.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Messages are sent to the syslog daemon using facility LOG_DAEMON. (This can be overridden by recompiling pppd with the macro LOG_PPP defined as the desired facility.)  See the <strong>syslog</strong>(8) documentation for details of where the syslog daemon will write the messages.  On most systems, the syslog daemon uses the /etc/syslog.conf file to specify the destination(s) for syslog messages.  You may need to edit that file to suit.</p><p>The <em>debug</em> option causes the contents of all control packets sent or received to be logged, that is, all LCP, PAP, CHAP, EAP, or IPCP packets. This can be useful if the PPP negotiation does not succeed or if authentication fails. If debugging is enabled at compile time, the <em>debug</em> option also causes other debugging messages to be logged.</p><p>Debugging can also be enabled or disabled by sending a SIGUSR1 signal to the pppd process.

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Pppd invokes scripts at various stages in its processing which can be used to perform site-specific ancillary processing.  These scripts are usually shell scripts, but could be executable code files instead. Pppd does not wait for the scripts to finish (except for the ip-pre-up script).  The scripts are executed as root (with the real and effective user-id set to 0), so that they can do things such as update routing tables or run privileged daemons.  Be careful that the contents of these scripts do not compromise your system's security.  Pppd runs the scripts with standard input, output and error redirected to /dev/null, and with an environment that is empty except for some environment variables that give information about the link.  The environment variables that pppd sets are:</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Some limited degree of control can be exercised over a running pppd process by sending it a signal from the list below.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>SIGINT, SIGTERM</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>These signals cause pppd to terminate the link (by closing LCP), restore the serial device settings, and exit.  If a connector or disconnector process is currently running, pppd will send the same signal to its process group, so as to terminate the connector or disconnector process.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>SIGHUP</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This signal causes pppd to terminate the link, restore the serial device settings, and close the serial device.  If the <em>persist</em> or <em>demand</em> option has been specified, pppd will try to reopen the serial device and start another connection (after the holdoff period). Otherwise pppd will exit.  If this signal is received during the holdoff period, it causes pppd to end the holdoff period immediately. If a connector or disconnector process is running, pppd will send the same signal to its process group.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>SIGUSR1</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This signal toggles the state of the <em>debug</em> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>SIGUSR2</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This signal causes pppd to renegotiate compression.  This can be useful to re-enable compression after it has been disabled as a result of a fatal decompression error.  (Fatal decompression errors generally indicate a bug in one or other implementation.)</p>
