This option can also be set in the configuration file as popen_whitelist.</p><p><strong>-dc-default string</strong></p><p>A comma separated list of XIO drivers and options representing the default network stack. Format is of each driver entry is driver1[:opt1=val1;opt2=val2;...]. The bottom of the stack, the transport driver, is always first. This option can also be set in the configuration file as dc_default.</p><p><strong>-fs-default string</strong></p><p>A comma separated list of XIO drivers and options representing the default disk stack.

<p><strong>-c string</strong></p><p>Path to main configuration file that should be loaded. Otherwise will attempt to load $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/gridftp.conf and /etc/grid-security/gridftp.conf.</p><p><strong>-C string</strong></p><p>Path to directory holding configuration files that should be loaded. Files will be loaded in alphabetical order, and in the event of duplcate parameters the last loaded file will take precedence.

This option can also be set in the configuration file as config_dir.</p><p><strong>-config-base-path string</strong></p><p>Base path to use when config and log path options are not full paths. By default this is the current directory when the process is started.

Forces no-fork, no-chdir, and allows core dumps on bad signals instead of exiting cleanly. Not recommended for production servers.
