        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><em>Lsof</em> revision \*(VN lists on its standard output file information about files opened by processes for the following UNIX dialects:</p>
<pre>
	Apple Darwin 9 and Mac OS X 10.[567]
	FreeBSD 4.9 and 6.4 for x86-based systems
	FreeBSD 8.2, 9.0 and 10.0 for AMD64-based systems
	Linux 2.1.72 and above for x86-based systems
	Solaris 9, 10 and 11
</pre>
<p>(See the <strong>DISTRIBUTION</strong> section of this manual page for information on how to obtain the latest <em>lsof</em> revision.)</p><p>An open file may be a regular file, a directory, a block special file, a character special file, an executing text reference, a library, a stream or a network file (Internet socket, NFS file or UNIX domain socket.) A specific file or all the files in a file system may be selected by path.</p><p>Instead of a formatted display, <em>lsof</em> will produce output that can be parsed by other programs. See the <strong>-F</strong>, option description, and the <strong>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</strong> section for more information.</p><p>In addition to producing a single output list, <em>lsof</em> will run in repeat mode. In repeat mode it will produce output, delay, then repeat the output operation until stopped with an interrupt or quit signal. See the <strong>+|-r</strong><em> [t[m&lt;fmt&gt;]]</em> option description for more information.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>In the absence of any options, <em>lsof</em> lists all open files belonging to all active processes.</p><p>If any list request option is specified, other list requests must be specifically requested - e.g., if <strong>-U</strong> is specified for the listing of UNIX socket files, NFS files won't be listed unless <strong>-N</strong> is also specified; or if a user list is specified with the <strong>-u</strong> option, UNIX domain socket files, belonging to users not in the list, won't be listed unless the <strong>-U</strong> option is also specified.</p><p>Normally list options that are specifically stated are ORed - i.e., specifying the <strong>-i</strong> option without an address and the <strong>-u</strong>foo option produces a listing of all network files OR files belonging to processes owned by user ``foo''. The exceptions are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>1)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>the `^' (negated) login name or user ID (UID), specified with the <strong>-u</strong> option;</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>2)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>the `^' (negated) process ID (PID), specified with the <strong>-p</strong> option;</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>3)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>the `^' (negated) process group ID (PGID), specified with the <strong>-g</strong> option;</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>4)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>the `^' (negated) command, specified with the <strong>-c</strong> option;</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>5)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>the (`^') negated TCP or UDP protocol state names, specified with the <strong>-s</strong><em> [p:s]</em> option.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Since they represent exclusions, they are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect before any other selection criteria are applied.</p><p>The <strong>-a</strong> option may be used to AND the selections. For example, specifying <strong>-a</strong>, <strong>-U</strong>, and <strong>-u</strong>foo produces a listing of only UNIX socket files that belong to processes owned by user ``foo''.</p><p>Caution: the <strong>-a</strong> option causes all list selection options to be ANDed; it can't be used to cause ANDing of selected pairs of selection options by placing it between them, even though its placement there is acceptable. Wherever <strong>-a</strong> is placed, it causes the ANDing of all selection options.</p><p>Items of the same selection set - command names, file descriptors, network addresses, process identifiers, user identifiers, zone names, security contexts - are joined in a single ORed set and applied before the result participates in ANDing. Thus, for example, specifying <strong>-i</strong>@aaa.bbb, <strong>-i</strong>@ccc.ddd, <strong>-a</strong>, and <strong>-u</strong>fff,ggg will select the listing of files that belong to either login ``fff'' OR ``ggg'' AND have network connections to either host aaa.bbb OR ccc.ddd.</p><p>Options may be grouped together following a single prefix -- e.g., the option set ``<strong>-a -b -C</strong>'' may be stated as <strong>-abC</strong>. However, since values are optional following <strong>+|-f</strong>, <strong>-F</strong>, <strong>-g</strong>, <strong>-i</strong>, <strong>+|-L</strong>, <strong>-o</strong>, <strong>+|-r</strong>, <strong>-s</strong>, <strong>-S</strong>, <strong>-T</strong>, <strong>-x</strong> and <strong>-z</strong>. when you have no values for them be careful that the following character isn't ambiguous. For example, <strong>-Fn</strong> might represent the <strong>-F</strong> and <strong>-n</strong> options, or it might represent the <strong>n</strong> field identifier character following the <strong>-F</strong> option. When ambiguity is possible, start a new option with a `-' character - e.g., ``<strong>-F -n</strong>''. If the next option is a file name, follow the possibly ambiguous option with ``--'' - e.g., ``<strong>-F -- </strong><em>name</em>''.</p><p>Either the `+' or the `-' prefix may be applied to a group of options. Options that don't take on separate meanings for each prefix - e.g., <strong>-i</strong> - may be grouped under either prefix. Thus, for example, ``+M -i'' may be stated as ``+Mi'' and the group means the same as the separate options. Be careful of prefix grouping when one or more options in the group does take on separate meanings under different prefixes - e.g., <strong>+|-M</strong>; ``-iM'' is not the same request as ``-i +M''. When in doubt, use separate options with appropriate prefixes.</p>

    <p>selects the listing of files for processes executing the command that begins with the characters of <em>c</em>. Multiple commands may be specified, using multiple <strong>-c</strong> options. They are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection.</p><ul>
<li><p>If <em>c</em> begins with a `^', then the following characters specify a command name whose processes are to be ignored (excluded.)</p></li><li><p>If <em>c</em> begins and ends with a slash ('/'), the characters between the slashes are interpreted as a regular expression. Shell meta-characters in the regular expression must be quoted to prevent their interpretation by the shell. The closing slash may be followed by these modifiers:</p></li><li>
<pre>
	b	the regular expression is a basic one.

	i	ignore the case of letters.

	x	the regular expression is an extended one

		(default).
</pre>
</li><li><p>See the <em>lsof</em> FAQ (The <strong>FAQ</strong> section gives its location.) for more information on basic and extended regular expressions.</p></li><li><p>The simple command specification is tested first. If that test fails, the command regular expression is applied. If the simple command test succeeds, the command regular expression test isn't made. This may result in ``no command found for regex:'' messages when lsof's <strong>-V</strong> option is specified.</p></li>

This is because it must descend the entire directory tree, rooted at <em>D</em>, calling <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a> for each file and directory, building a list of all the files it finds, and searching that list for a match with every open file.

<li><p><strong>-D</strong> must be followed by a function letter; the function letter may optionally be followed by a path name. <em>Lsof</em> recognizes these function letters:</p></li><li>
<pre>
	<strong>?</strong> - report device cache file paths
	<strong>b</strong> - build the device cache file
	<strong>i</strong> - ignore the device cache file
	<strong>r</strong> - read the device cache file
	<strong>u</strong> - read and update the device cache file
</pre>
</li><li><p>The <strong>b</strong>, <strong>r</strong>, and <strong>u</strong> functions, accompanied by a path name, are sometimes restricted. When these functions are restricted, they will not appear in the description of the <strong>-D</strong> option that accompanies <strong>-h</strong> or <strong>-?</strong> option output. See the <strong>DEVICE CACHE FILE</strong> section and the sections that follow it for more information on these functions and when they're restricted.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>?</strong> function reports the read-only and write paths that lsof can use for the device cache file, the names of any environment variables whose values <em>lsof</em> will examine when forming the device cache file path, and the format for the personal device cache file path. (Escape the `?' character as your shell requires.)</p></li><li><p>When available, the <strong>b</strong>, <strong>r</strong>, and <strong>u</strong> functions may be followed by the device cache file's path. The standard default is <em>.lsof_hostname</em> in the home directory of the real user ID that executes <em>lsof</em>, but this could have been changed when <em>lsof</em> was configured and compiled. (The output of the <strong>-h</strong> and <strong>-?</strong> options show the current default prefix - e.g., ``.lsof''.) The suffix, <em>hostname</em>, is the first component of the host's name returned by <a href="../man2/gethostname.2.html"><strong>gethostname</strong>(2)</a><em>.</em></p></li><li><p>When available, the <strong>b</strong> function directs <em>lsof</em> to build a new device cache file at the default or specified path.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>i</strong> function directs <em>lsof</em> to ignore the default device cache file and obtain its information about devices via direct calls to the kernel.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>r</strong> function directs <em>lsof</em> to read the device cache at the default or specified path, but prevents it from creating a new device cache file when none exists or the existing one is improperly structured. The <strong>r</strong> function, when specified without a path name, prevents <em>lsof</em> from updating an incorrect or outdated device cache file, or creating a new one in its place. The <strong>r</strong> function is always available when it is specified without a path name argument; it may be restricted by the permissions of the <em>lsof</em> process.</p></li><li><p>When available, the <strong>u</strong> function directs <em>lsof</em> to read the device cache file at the default or specified path, if possible, and to rebuild it, if necessary. This is the default device cache file function when no <strong>-D</strong> option has been specified.</p></li>

    <p>exempts the file system whose path name is <em>s</em> from being subjected to kernel function calls that might block. The <strong>+e</strong> option exempts <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html"><strong>lstat</strong>(2)</a> and most <a href="../man2/readlink.2.html"><strong>readlink</strong>(2)</a> kernel function calls. The <strong>-e</strong> option exempts only <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a></em> and <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html"><strong>lstat</strong>(2)</a> kernel function calls. Multiple file systems may be specified with separate <strong>+|-e</strong> specifications and each may have <a href="../man2/readlink.2.html"><strong>readlink</strong>(2)</a> calls exempted or not.</p><ul>
<li><p>This option is currently implemented only for Linux.</p></li><li><p><strong>CAUTION:</strong> this option can easily be mis-applied to other than the file system of interest, because it uses path name rather than the more reliable device and inode numbers. (Device and inode numbers are acquired via the potentially blocking <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a> kernel call and are thus not available, but see the <strong>+|-m</strong><em> m</em> option as a possible alternative way to supply device numbers.) <strong>Use this option with great care and fully specify the path name of the</strong> file system to be exempted.</p></li><li><p>When open files on exempted file systems are reported, it may not be possible to obtain all their information. Therefore, some information columns will be blank, the characters ``UNKN'' preface the values in the TYPE column, and the applicable exemption option is added in parentheses to the end of the NAME column. (Some device number information might be made available via the <strong>+|-m</strong><em> m</em> option.)</p></li>

    <p><strong>f</strong> by itself clarifies how path name arguments are to be interpreted. When followed by <strong>c</strong>, <strong>f</strong>, <strong>g</strong>, <strong>G</strong>, or <strong>n</strong> in any combination it specifies that the listing of kernel file structure information is to be enabled (`+') or inhibited (`-').</p><ul>
<li><p>Normally a path name argument is taken to be a file system name if it matches a mounted-on directory name reported by <a href="../man8/mount.8.html"><strong>mount</strong>(8)</a>, or if it represents a block device, named in the <em>mount</em> output and associated with a mounted directory name. When <strong>+f</strong> is specified, all path name arguments will be taken to be file system names, and <em>lsof</em> will complain if any are not.

<li><p>The default reporting mode is set by the <em>lsof</em> builder with the HASPMAPENABLED #define in the dialect's machine.h header file; <em>lsof</em> is distributed with the HASPMAPENABLED #define deactivated, so portmapper reporting is disabled by default and must be requested with <strong>\+M</strong>. Specifying <em>lsof's</em> <strong>-h</strong> or <strong>-?</strong> option will report the default mode. Disabling portmapper registration when it is already disabled or enabling it when already enabled is acceptable. When portmapper registration reporting is enabled, <em>lsof</em> displays the portmapper registration (if any) for local TCP, UDP or UDPLITE ports in square brackets immediately following the port numbers or service names - e.g., ``:1234[name]'' or ``:name[100083]''. The registration information may be a name or number, depending on what the registering program supplied to the portmapper when it registered the port.</p></li><li><p>When portmapper registration reporting is enabled, <em>lsof</em> may run a little more slowly or even become blocked when access to the portmapper becomes congested or stopped. Reverse the reporting mode to determine if portmapper registration reporting is slowing or blocking <em>lsof</em>.</p></li><li><p>For purposes of portmapper registration reporting <em>lsof</em> considers a TCP, UDP or UDPLITE port local if: it is found in the local part of its containing kernel structure; or if it is located in the foreign part of its containing kernel structure and the local and foreign Internet addresses are the same; or if it is located in the foreign part of its containing kernel structure and the foreign Internet address is INADDR_LOOPBACK (127.0.0.1). This rule may make <em>lsof</em> ignore some foreign ports on machines with multiple interfaces when the foreign Internet address is on a different interface from the local one.</p></li><li><p>See the <em>lsof</em> FAQ (The <strong>FAQ</strong> section gives its location.) for further discussion of portmapper registration reporting issues.</p></li><li><p>Portmapper registration reporting is supported only on dialects that have RPC header files.

<li><p>This option does NOT direct <em>lsof</em> to display offset at all times; specify <strong>-o</strong> (without a trailing number) to do that. <strong>-o</strong><em> o</em> only specifies the number of digits after ``0t'' in either mixed size and offset or offset-only output. Thus, for example, to direct <em>lsof</em> to display offset at all times with a decimal digit count of 10, use:</p></li><li>

Note also that when &lt;fmt&gt; contains spaces or other characters that affect the shell's interpretation of arguments, &lt;fmt&gt; must be quoted appropriately.</p></li><li><p>Repeat mode reduces <em>lsof</em> startup overhead, so it is more efficient to use this mode than to call <em>lsof</em> repetitively from a shell script, for example.</p></li><li><p>To use repeat mode most efficiently, accompany <strong>+|-r</strong> with specification of other <em>lsof</em> selection options, so the amount of kernel memory access <em>lsof</em> does will be kept to a minimum.

I have never seen this happen or had a report of its happening, but I think there is a remote possibility it could happen.</p></li><li><p>By default use of readx() is disabled. On AIX 5L and above <em>lsof</em> may need setuid-root permission to perform the actions this option requests.</p></li><li><p>The <em>lsof</em> builder may specify that the <strong>-X</strong> option be restricted to processes whose real UID is root. If that has been done, the <strong>-X</strong> option will not appear in the <strong>-h</strong> or <strong>-?</strong> help output unless the real UID of the <em>lsof</em> process is root. The default <em>lsof</em> distribution allows any UID to specify <strong>-X,</strong> so by default it will appear in the help output.</p></li><li><p>When AIX readx() use is disabled, <em>lsof</em> may not be able to report information for all text and loader file references, but it may also avoid exacerbating an AIX kernel directory search kernel error, known as the Stale Segment ID bug.</p></li><li><p>The readx() function, used by <em>lsof</em> or any other program to access some sections of kernel virtual memory, can trigger the Stale Segment ID bug. It can cause the kernel's dir_search() function to believe erroneously that part of an in-memory copy of a file system directory has been zeroed. Another application process, distinct from <em>lsof</em>, asking the kernel to search the directory - e.g., by using <a href="../man2/open.2.html"><strong>open</strong>(2)</a> - can cause dir_search() to loop forever, thus hanging the application process.</p></li><li><p>Consult the <em>lsof</em> FAQ (The <strong>FAQ</strong> section gives its location.) and the <em>00README</em> file of the <em>lsof</em> distribution for a more complete description of the Stale Segment ID bug, its APAR, and methods for defining readx() use when compiling <em>lsof</em>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux:</p><p>This Linux option requests that <em>lsof</em> skip the reporting of information on all open TCP, UDP and UDPLITE IPv4 and IPv6 files.</p></li><li><p>This Linux option is most useful when the system has an extremely large number of open TCP, UDP and UDPLITE files, the processing of whose information in the <em>/proc/net/tcp*</em> and <em>/proc/net/udp*</em> files would take <em>lsof</em> a long time, and whose reporting is not of interest.</p></li><li><p>Use this option with care and only when you are sure that the information you want <em>lsof</em> to display isn't associated with open TCP, UDP or UDPLITE socket files. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solaris 10 and above:</p><p>This Solaris 10 and above option requests the reporting of cached paths for files that have been deleted - i.e., removed with <em>rm</em>(1) or <a href="../man2/unlink.2.html"><strong>unlink</strong>(2)</a>.</p></li><li><p>The cached path is followed by the string ``&nbsp;(deleted)'' to indicate that the path by which the file was opened has been deleted.</p></li><li><p>Because intervening changes made to the path - i.e., renames with <em>mv</em>(1) or <a href="../man2/rename.2.html"><strong>rename</strong>(2)</a> - are not recorded in the cached path, what <em>lsof</em> reports is only the path by which the file was opened, not its possibly different final path.</p></li>

The <strong>+|-f</strong> option may be used to force <em>lsof</em> to consider a <em>name</em> a file system identifier (<strong>+f</strong>) or a simple file (<strong>-f</strong>).</p></li><li><p>If <em>name</em> is a path to a directory that is not the mounted-on directory name of a file system, it is treated just as a regular file is treated - i.e., its listing is restricted to processes that have it open as a file or as a process-specific directory, such as the root or current working directory. To request that <em>lsof</em> look for open files inside a directory name, use the <strong>+d</strong><em> s</em> and <strong>+D</strong><em> D</em> options.</p></li><li><p>If a <em>name</em> is the base name of a family of multiplexed files - e. g, AIX's <em>/dev/pt[cs]</em> - <em>lsof</em> will list all the associated multiplexed files on the device that are open - e.g., <em>/dev/pt[cs]/1</em>, <em>/dev/pt[cs]/2</em>, etc.</p></li><li><p>If a <em>name</em> is a UNIX domain socket name, <em>lsof</em> will usually search for it by the characters of the name alone - exactly as it is specified and is recorded in the kernel socket structure. (See the next paragraph for an exception to that rule for Linux.) Specifying a relative path - e.g., <em>./file</em> - in place of the file's absolute path - e.g., <em>/tmp/file</em> - won't work because <em>lsof</em> must match the characters you specify with what it finds in the kernel UNIX domain socket structures.</p></li><li><p>If a <em>name</em> is a Linux UNIX domain socket name, in one case <em>lsof</em> is able to search for it by its device and inode number, allowing <em>name</em> to be a relative path. The case requires that the absolute path -- i.e., one beginning with a slash ('/') be used by the process that created the socket, and hence be stored in the <em>/proc/net/unix</em> file; and it requires that <em>lsof</em> be able to obtain the device and node numbers of both the absolute path in <em>/proc/net/unix</em> and <em>name</em> via successful <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a> system calls. When those conditions are met, <em>lsof</em> will be able to search for the UNIX domain socket when some path to it is is specified in <em>name</em>. Thus, for example, if the path is <em>/dev/log</em>, and an <em>lsof</em> search is initiated when the working directory is <em>/dev</em>, then <em>name</em> could be <em>./log</em>.</p></li><li><p>If a <em>name</em> is none of the above, <em>lsof</em> will list any open files whose device and inode match that of the specified path <em>name</em>.</p></li><li><p>If you have also specified the <strong>-b</strong> option, the only <em>names</em> you may safely specify are file systems for which your mount table supplies alternate device numbers. See the <strong>AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS</strong> and <strong>ALTERNATE DEVICE NUMBERS</strong> sections for more information.</p></li><li><p>Multiple file names are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection.</p></li>

In that case, <em>lsof</em> may have to guess at the identity of AFS files, and might not be able to obtain volume information from the kernel that is needed for calculating AFS volume node numbers. When <em>lsof</em> can't compute volume node numbers, it reports blank in the NODE column.</p><p>The <strong>-A</strong><em> A</em> option is available in some dialect implementations of <em>lsof</em> for specifying the name list file where dynamic module kernel addresses may be found.

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><em>Lsof</em> has three features that may cause security concerns. First, its default compilation mode allows anyone to list all open files with it. Second, by default it creates a user-readable and user-writable device cache file in the home directory of the real user ID that executes <em>lsof</em>. (The list-all-open-files and device cache features may be disabled when <em>lsof</em> is compiled.) Third, its <strong>-k</strong> and <strong>-m</strong> options name alternate kernel name list or memory files.</p><p>Restricting the listing of all open files is controlled by the compile-time HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY options. When HASSECURITY is defined, <em>lsof</em> will allow only the root user to list all open files. The non-root user may list only open files of processes with the same user IDentification number as the real user ID number of the <em>lsof</em> process (the one that its user logged on with).</p><p>However, if HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY are both defined, anyone may list open socket files, provided they are selected with the <strong>-i</strong> option.</p><p>When HASSECURITY is not defined, anyone may list all open files.</p><p>Help output, presented in response to the <strong>-h</strong> or <strong>-?</strong> option, gives the status of the HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY definitions.</p><p>See the <strong>Security</strong> section of the <em>00README</em> file of the <em>lsof</em> distribution for information on building <em>lsof</em> with the HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY options enabled.</p><p>Creation and use of a user-readable and user-writable device cache file is controlled by the compile-time HASDCACHE option. See the <strong>DEVICE CACHE FILE</strong> section and the sections that follow it for details on how its path is formed. For security considerations it is important to note that in the default <em>lsof</em> distribution, if the real user ID under which <em>lsof</em> is executed is root, the device cache file will be written in root's home directory - e.g., <em>/</em> or <em>/root</em>. When HASDCACHE is not defined, <em>lsof</em> does not write or attempt to read a device cache file.</p><p>When HASDCACHE is defined, the <em>lsof</em> help output, presented in response to the <strong>-h</strong>, <strong>-D?</strong>, or <strong>-?</strong> options, will provide device cache file handling information. When HASDCACHE is not defined, the <strong>-h</strong> or <strong>-?</strong> output will have no <strong>-D</strong> option description.</p><p>Before you decide to disable the device cache file feature - enabling it improves the performance of <em>lsof</em> by reducing the startup overhead of examining all the nodes in <em>/dev</em> (or <em>/devices</em>) - read the discussion of it in the <em>00DCACHE</em> file of the <em>lsof</em> distribution and the <em>lsof</em> FAQ (The <strong>FAQ</strong> section gives its location.)</p><p>WHEN IN DOUBT, YOU CAN TEMPORARILY DISABLE THE USE OF THE DEVICE CACHE FILE WITH THE <strong>-Di</strong> OPTION.</p><p>When <em>lsof</em> user declares alternate kernel name list or memory files with the <strong>-k</strong> and <strong>-m</strong> options, <em>lsof</em> checks the user's authority to read them with <a href="../man2/access.2.html"><strong>access</strong>(2)</a>. This is intended to prevent whatever special power <em>lsof's</em> modes might confer on it from letting it read files not normally accessible via the authority of the real user ID.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">LOCKS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><em>Lsof</em> can't adequately report the wide variety of UNIX dialect file locks in a single character. What it reports in a single character is a compromise between the information it finds in the kernel and the limitations of the reporting format.</p><p>Moreover, when a process holds several byte level locks on a file, <em>lsof</em> only reports the status of the first lock it encounters. If it is a byte level lock, then the lock character will be reported in lower case - i.e., `r', `w', or `x' - rather than the upper case equivalent reported for a full file lock.</p><p>Generally <em>lsof</em> can only report on locks held by local processes on local files. When a local process sets a lock on a remotely mounted (e.g., NFS) file, the remote server host usually records the lock state. One exception is Solaris - at some patch levels of 2.3, and in all versions above 2.4, the Solaris kernel records information on remote locks in local structures.</p><p><em>Lsof</em> has trouble reporting locks for some UNIX dialects. Consult the <strong>BUGS</strong> section of this manual page or the <em>lsof</em> FAQ (The <strong>FAQ</strong> section gives its location.) for more information.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>When the <strong>-F</strong> option is specified, <em>lsof</em> produces output that is suitable for processing by another program - e.g, an <em>awk</em> or <em>Perl</em> script, or a C program.</p><p>Each unit of information is output in a field that is identified with a leading character and terminated by a NL (012) (or a NUL (000) if the 0 (zero) field identifier character is specified.) The data of the field follows immediately after the field identification character and extends to the field terminator.</p><p>It is possible to think of field output as process and file sets. A process set begins with a field whose identifier is `p' (for process IDentifier (PID)). It extends to the beginning of the next PID field or the beginning of the first file set of the process, whichever comes first. Included in the process set are fields that identify the command, the process group IDentification (PGID) number, the task number and the user ID (UID) number or login name.</p><p>A file set begins with a field whose identifier is `f' (for file descriptor). It is followed by lines that describe the file's access mode, lock state, type, device, size, offset, inode, protocol, name and stream module names. It extends to the beginning of the next file or process set, whichever comes first.</p><p>When the NUL (000) field terminator has been selected with the 0 (zero) field identifier character, <em>lsof</em> ends each process and file set with a NL (012) character.</p><p><em>Lsof</em> always produces one field, the PID (`p') field. All other fields may be declared optionally in the field identifier character list that follows the <strong>-F</strong> option. When a field selection character identifies an item <em>lsof</em> does not normally list - e.g., PPID, selected with <strong>-R</strong> - specification of the field character - e.g., ``<strong>-FR</strong>'' - also selects the listing of the item.</p><p>It is entirely possible to select a set of fields that cannot easily be parsed - e.g., if the field descriptor field is not selected, it may be difficult to identify file sets. To help you avoid this difficulty, <em>lsof</em> supports the <strong>-F</strong> option; it selects the output of all fields with NL terminators (the <strong>-F0</strong> option pair selects the output of all fields with NUL terminators). For compatibility reasons neither <strong>-F</strong> nor <strong>-F0</strong> select the raw device field.</p><p>These are the fields that <em>lsof</em> will produce. The single character listed first is the field identifier.</p>

Additional information on field content can be found in the <strong>OUTPUT</strong> section.</p><p>As an example, ``<strong>-F pcfn</strong>'' will select the process ID (`p'), command name (`c'), file descriptor (`f') and file name (`n') fields with an NL field terminator character; ``<strong>-F pcfn0</strong>'' selects the same output with a NUL (000) field terminator character.</p><p><em>Lsof</em> doesn't produce all fields for every process or file set, only those that are available. Some fields are mutually exclusive: file device characters and file major/minor device numbers; file inode number and protocol name; file name and stream identification; file size and offset. One or the other member of these mutually exclusive sets will appear in field output, but not both.</p><p>Normally <em>lsof</em> ends each field with a NL (012) character. The 0 (zero) field identifier character may be specified to change the field terminator character to a NUL (000). A NUL terminator may be easier to process with <em>xargs (1),</em> for example, or with programs whose quoting mechanisms may not easily cope with the range of characters in the field output. When the NUL field terminator is in use, <em>lsof</em> ends each process and file set with a NL (012).</p><p>Three aids to producing programs that can process <em>lsof</em> field output are included in the <em>lsof</em> distribution. The first is a C header file, <em>lsof_fields.h</em>, that contains symbols for the field identification characters, indexes for storing them in a table, and explanation strings that may be compiled into programs. <em>Lsof</em> uses this header file.</p><p>The second aid is a set of sample scripts that process field output, written in <em>awk</em>, <em>Perl</em> 4, and <em>Perl</em> 5. They're located in the <em>scripts</em> subdirectory of the <em>lsof</em> distribution.</p><p>The third aid is the C library used for the <em>lsof</em> test suite. The test suite is written in C and uses field output to validate the correct operation of <em>lsof</em>. The library can be found in the <em>tests/LTlib.c</em> file of the <em>lsof</em> distribution. The library uses the first aid, the <em>lsof_fields.h</em> header file.</p>

<p><em>Lsof</em> can be blocked by some kernel functions that it uses - <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html"><strong>lstat</strong>(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/readlink.2.html"><strong>readlink</strong>(2)</a>, and <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a>. These functions are stalled in the kernel, for example, when the hosts where mounted NFS file systems reside become inaccessible.</p><p><em>Lsof</em> attempts to break these blocks with timers and child processes, but the techniques are not wholly reliable. When <em>lsof</em> does manage to break a block, it will report the break with an error message. The messages may be suppressed with the <strong>-t</strong> and <strong>-w</strong> options.</p><p>The default timeout value may be displayed with the <strong>-h</strong> or <strong>-?</strong> option, and it may be changed with the <strong>-S</strong><em> [t]</em> option. The minimum for <em>t</em> is two seconds, but you should avoid small values, since slow system responsiveness can cause short timeouts to expire unexpectedly and perhaps stop <em>lsof</em> before it can produce any output.</p><p>When <em>lsof</em> has to break a block during its access of mounted file system information, it normally continues, although with less information available to display about open files.</p><p><em>Lsof</em> can also be directed to avoid the protection of timers and child processes when using the kernel functions that might block by specifying the <strong>-O</strong> option. While this will allow <em>lsof</em> to start up with less overhead, it exposes <em>lsof</em> completely to the kernel situations that might block it. Use this option cautiously.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>You can use the <strong>-b</strong> option to tell <em>lsof</em> to avoid using kernel functions that would block. Some cautions apply.</p><p>First, using this option usually requires that your system supply alternate device numbers in place of the device numbers that <em>lsof</em> would normally obtain with the <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html"><strong>lstat</strong>(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a> kernel functions. See the <strong>ALTERNATE DEVICE NUMBERS</strong> section for more information on alternate device numbers.</p><p>Second, you can't specify <em>names</em> for <em>lsof</em> to locate unless they're file system names. This is because <em>lsof</em> needs to know the device and inode numbers of files listed with <em>names</em> in the <em>lsof</em> options, and the <strong>-b</strong> option prevents <em>lsof</em> from obtaining them. Moreover, since <em>lsof</em> only has device numbers for the file systems that have alternates, its ability to locate files on file systems depends completely on the availability and accuracy of the alternates. If no alternates are available, or if they're incorrect, <em>lsof</em> won't be able to locate files on the named file systems.</p><p>Third, if the names of your file system directories that <em>lsof</em> obtains from your system's mount table are symbolic links, <em>lsof</em> won't be able to resolve the links. This is because the <strong>-b</strong> option causes <em>lsof</em> to avoid the kernel <a href="../man2/readlink.2.html"><strong>readlink</strong>(2)</a> function it uses to resolve symbolic links.</p><p>Finally, using the <strong>-b</strong> option causes <em>lsof</em> to issue warning messages when it needs to use the kernel functions that the <strong>-b</strong> option directs it to avoid. You can suppress these messages by specifying the <strong>-w</strong> option, but if you do, you won't see the alternate device numbers reported in the warning messages.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">ALTERNATE DEVICE NUMBERS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>On some dialects, when <em>lsof</em> has to break a block because it can't get information about a mounted file system via the <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html"><strong>lstat</strong>(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a> kernel functions, or because you specified the <strong>-b</strong> option, <em>lsof</em> can obtain some of the information it needs - the device number and possibly the file system type - from the system mount table. When that is possible, <em>lsof</em> will report the device number it obtained. (You can suppress the report by specifying the <strong>-w</strong> option.)</p><p>You can assist this process if your mount table is supported with an <em>/etc/mtab</em> or <em>/etc/mnttab</em> file that contains an options field by adding a ``dev=xxxx'' field for mount points that do not have one in their options strings. Note: you must be able to edit the file - i.e., some mount tables like recent Solaris /etc/mnttab or Linux /proc/mounts are read-only and can't be modified.</p><p>You may also be able to supply device numbers using the <strong>+m</strong> and <strong>+m</strong><em> m</em> options, provided they are supported by your dialect. Check the output of <em>lsof's</em> <strong>-h</strong> or <strong>-?</strong> options to see if the <strong>+m</strong> and <strong>+m</strong><em> m</em> options are available.</p><p>The ``xxxx'' portion of the field is the hexadecimal value of the file system's device number. (Consult the <em>st_dev</em> field of the output of the <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html"><strong>lstat</strong>(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a> functions for the appropriate values for your file systems.) Here's an example from a Sun Solaris 2.6 <em>/etc/mnttab</em> for a file system remotely mounted via NFS:</p>
<pre>
	nfs  ignore,noquota,dev=2a40001
</pre>
<p>There's an advantage to having ``dev=xxxx'' entries in your mount table file, especially for file systems that are mounted from remote NFS servers. When a remote server crashes and you want to identify its users by running <em>lsof</em> on one of its clients, <em>lsof</em> probably won't be able to get output from the <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html"><strong>lstat</strong>(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a> functions for the file system. If it can obtain the file system's device number from the mount table, it will be able to display the files open on the crashed NFS server.</p><p>Some dialects that do not use an ASCII <em>/etc/mtab</em> or <em>/etc/mnttab</em> file for the mount table may still provide an alternative device number in their internal mount tables. This includes AIX, Apple Darwin, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Tru64 UNIX. <em>Lsof</em> knows how to obtain the alternative device number for these dialects and uses it when its attempt to <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html"><strong>lstat</strong>(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a> the file system is blocked.</p><p>If you're not sure your dialect supplies alternate device numbers for file systems from its mount table, use this <em>lsof</em> incantation to see if it reports any alternate device numbers:</p><ul>
<li><p>lsof -b</p></li>
</ul><p>Look for standard error file warning messages that begin ``assuming "dev=xxxx" from ...''.</p>

<p><em>Lsof</em> is able to examine the kernel's name cache or use other kernel facilities (e.g., the ADVFS 4.x tag_to_path() function under Tru64 UNIX) on some dialects for most file system types, excluding AFS, and extract recently used path name components from it. (AFS file system path lookups don't use the kernel's name cache; some Solaris VxFS file system operations apparently don't use it, either.)</p><p><em>Lsof</em> reports the complete paths it finds in the NAME column.

That's because other running processes can cause the kernel to remove entries from its name cache and replace them with others.</p><p><em>Lsof's</em> use of the kernel name cache to identify the paths of files can lead it to report incorrect components under some circumstances. This can happen when the kernel name cache uses device and node number as a key (e.g., SCO OpenServer) and a key on a rapidly changing file system is reused. If the UNIX dialect's kernel doesn't purge the name cache entry for a file when it is unlinked, <em>lsof</em> may find a reference to the wrong entry in the cache.

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Examining all members of the <em>/dev</em> (or <em>/devices</em>) node tree with <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a> functions can be time consuming. What's more, the information that <em>lsof</em> needs - device number, inode number, and path - rarely changes.</p><p>Consequently, <em>lsof</em> normally maintains an ASCII text file of cached <em>/dev</em> (or <em>/devices</em>) information (exception: the /proc-based Linux <em>lsof</em> where it's not needed.) The local system administrator who builds <em>lsof</em> can control the way the device cache file path is formed, selecting from these options:</p>
<pre>
	Path from the <strong>-D</strong> option;
	Path from an environment variable;
	System-wide path;
	Personal path (the default);
	Personal path, modified by an environment variable.
</pre>
<p>Consult the output of the <strong>-h</strong>, <strong>-D? ,</strong> or <strong>-?</strong> help options for the current state of device cache support. The help output lists the default read-mode device cache file path that is in effect for the current invocation of <em>lsof</em>. The <strong>-D?</strong> option output lists the read-only and write device cache file paths, the names of any applicable environment variables, and the personal device cache path format.</p><p><em>Lsof</em> can detect that the current device cache file has been accidentally or maliciously modified by integrity checks, including the computation and verification of a sixteen bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) sum on the file's contents. When <em>lsof</em> senses something wrong with the file, it issues a warning and attempts to remove the current cache file and create a new copy, but only to a path that the process can legitimately write.</p><p>The path from which a <em>lsof</em> process may attempt to read a device cache file may not be the same as the path to which it can legitimately write. Thus when <em>lsof</em> senses that it needs to update the device cache file, it may choose a different path for writing it from the path from which it read an incorrect or outdated version.</p><p>If available, the <strong>-Dr</strong> option will inhibit the writing of a new device cache file. (It's always available when specified without a path name argument.)</p><p>When a new device is added to the system, the device cache file may need to be recreated. Since <em>lsof</em> compares the mtime of the device cache file with the mtime and ctime of the <em>/dev</em> (or <em>/devices</em>) directory, it usually detects that a new device has been added; in that case <em>lsof</em> issues a warning message and attempts to rebuild the device cache file.</p><p>Whenever <em>lsof</em> writes a device cache file, it sets its ownership to the real UID of the executing process, and its permission modes to 0600, this restricting its reading and writing to the file's owner.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">BUGS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Since <em>lsof</em> reads kernel memory in its search for open files, rapid changes in kernel memory may produce unpredictable results.</p><p>When a file has multiple record locks, the lock status character (following the file descriptor) is derived from a test of the first lock structure, not from any combination of the individual record locks that might be described by multiple lock structures.</p><p><em>Lsof</em> can't search for files with restrictive access permissions by <em>name</em> unless it is installed with root set-UID permission. Otherwise it is limited to searching for files to which its user or its set-GID group (if any) has access permission.</p><p>The display of the destination address of a raw socket (e.g., for <em>ping</em>) depends on the UNIX operating system. Some dialects store the destination address in the raw socket's protocol control block, some do not.</p><p><em>Lsof</em> can't always represent Solaris device numbers in the same way that <em>ls</em>(1) does. For example, the major and minor device numbers that the <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html"><strong>lstat</strong>(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a> functions report for the directory on which CD-ROM files are mounted (typically <em>/cdrom</em>) are not the same as the ones that it reports for the device on which CD-ROM files are mounted (typically <em>/dev/sr0</em>). (<em>Lsof</em> reports the directory numbers.)</p><p>The support for <em>/proc</em> file systems is available only for BSD and Tru64 UNIX dialects, Linux, and dialects derived from SYSV R4 - e.g., FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, UnixWare.</p><p>Some <em>/proc</em> file items - device number, inode number, and file size - are unavailable in some dialects. Searching for files in a <em>/proc</em> file system may require that the full path name be specified.</p><p>No text (<strong>txt</strong>) file descriptors are displayed for Linux processes. All entries for files other than the current working directory, the root directory, and numerical file descriptors are labeled <strong>mem</strong> descriptors.</p><p><em>Lsof</em> can't search for Tru64 UNIX named pipes by name, because their kernel implementation of <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html"><strong>lstat</strong>(2)</a> returns an improper device number for a named pipe.</p><p><em>Lsof</em> can't report fully or correctly on HP-UX 9.01, 10.20, and 11.00 locks because of insufficient access to kernel data or errors in the kernel data. See the <em>lsof</em> FAQ (The <strong>FAQ</strong> section gives its location.) for details.</p><p>The AIX SMT file type is a fabrication. It's made up for file structures whose type (15) isn't defined in the AIX <em>/usr/include/sys/file.h</em> header file. One way to create such file structures is to run X clients with the DISPLAY variable set to ``:0.0''.</p><p>The <strong>+|-f</strong><em>[cfgGn]</em> option is not supported under /proc-based Linux <em>lsof</em>, because it doesn't read kernel structures from kernel memory.</p>

<p>The latest distribution of <em>lsof</em> is available via anonymous ftp from the host <em>lsof.itap.purdue.edu</em>. You'll find the <em>lsof</em> distribution in the <em>pub/tools/unix/lsof</em> directory.</p><p>You can also use this URL:</p><ul>
<li><p>ftp://lsof.itap.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof</p></li>
</ul><p><em>Lsof</em> is also mirrored elsewhere. When you access <em>lsof.itap.purdue.edu</em> and change to its <em>pub/tools/unix/lsof</em> directory, you'll be given a list of some mirror sites. The <em>pub/tools/unix/lsof</em> directory also contains a more complete list in its <em>mirrors</em> file. Use mirrors with caution - not all mirrors always have the latest <em>lsof</em> revision.</p><p>Some pre-compiled <em>Lsof</em> executables are available on <em>lsof.itap.purdue.edu</em>, but their use is discouraged - it's better that you build your own from the sources. If you feel you must use a pre-compiled executable, please read the cautions that appear in the README files of the <em>pub/tools/unix/lsof/binaries</em> subdirectories and in the 00* files of the distribution.</p><p>More information on the <em>lsof</em> distribution can be found in its <em>README.lsof_&lt;version&gt;</em> file.
