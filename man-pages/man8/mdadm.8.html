      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>RAID devices are virtual devices created from two or more real block devices.  This allows multiple devices (typically disk drives or partitions thereof) to be combined into a single device to hold (for example) a single filesystem. Some RAID levels include redundancy and so can survive some degree of device failure.</p><p>Linux Software RAID devices are implemented through the md (Multiple Devices) device driver.</p><p>Currently, Linux supports <strong>LINEAR</strong> md devices, <strong>RAID0</strong> (striping), <strong>RAID1</strong> (mirroring), <strong>RAID4</strong>, <strong>RAID5</strong>, <strong>RAID6</strong>, <strong>RAID10</strong>, <strong>MULTIPATH</strong>, <strong>FAULTY</strong>, and <strong>CONTAINER</strong>.</p><p><strong>MULTIPATH</strong> is not a Software RAID mechanism, but does involve multiple devices: each device is a path to one common physical storage device. New installations should not use md/multipath as it is not well supported and has no ongoing development.  Use the Device Mapper based multipath-tools instead.</p><p><strong>FAULTY</strong> is also not true RAID, and it only involves one device.  It provides a layer over a true device that can be used to inject faults.</p><p><strong>CONTAINER</strong> is different again.  A <strong>CONTAINER</strong> is a collection of devices that are managed as a set.  This is similar to the set of devices connected to a hardware RAID controller.  The set of devices may contain a number of different RAID arrays each utilising some (or all) of the blocks from a number of the devices in the set.  For example, two devices in a 5-device set might form a RAID1 using the whole devices.  The remaining three might have a RAID5 over the first half of each device, and a RAID0 over the second half.</p><p>With a <strong>CONTAINER</strong>, there is one set of metadata that describes all of the arrays in the container.  So when <em>mdadm</em> creates a <strong>CONTAINER</strong> device, the device just represents the metadata.  Other normal arrays (RAID1 etc) can be created inside the container.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">MODES</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>mdadm has several major modes of operation:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Assemble</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Assemble the components of a previously created array into an active array.  Components can be explicitly given or can be searched for. <em>mdadm</em> checks that the components do form a bona fide array, and can, on request, fiddle superblock information so as to assemble a faulty array.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Build</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Build an array that doesn't have per-device metadata (superblocks).  For these sorts of arrays, <em>mdadm</em> cannot differentiate between initial creation and subsequent assembly of an array.  It also cannot perform any checks that appropriate components have been requested.  Because of this, the <strong>Build</strong> mode should only be used together with a complete understanding of what you are doing.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Create</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Create a new array with per-device metadata (superblocks). Appropriate metadata is written to each device, and then the array comprising those devices is activated.  A 'resync' process is started to make sure that the array is consistent (e.g. both sides of a mirror contain the same data) but the content of the device is left otherwise untouched. The array can be used as soon as it has been created.  There is no need to wait for the initial resync to finish.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Follow or Monitor</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Monitor one or more md devices and act on any state changes.  This is only meaningful for RAID1, 4, 5, 6, 10 or multipath arrays, as only these have interesting state.  RAID0 or Linear never have missing, spare, or failed drives, so there is nothing to monitor.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Grow</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Grow (or shrink) an array, or otherwise reshape it in some way. Currently supported growth options including changing the active size of component devices and changing the number of active devices in Linear and RAID levels 0/1/4/5/6, changing the RAID level between 0, 1, 5, and 6, and between 0 and 10, changing the chunk size and layout for RAID 0,4,5,6,10 as well as adding or removing a write-intent bitmap.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Incremental Assembly</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Add a single device to an appropriate array.  If the addition of the device makes the array runnable, the array will be started. This provides a convenient interface to a <em>hot-plug</em> system.  As each device is detected, <em>mdadm</em> has a chance to include it in some array as appropriate. Optionally, when the <em>--fail</em> flag is passed in we will remove the device from any active array instead of adding it.</p><p>If a <strong>CONTAINER</strong> is passed to <em>mdadm</em> in this mode, then any arrays within that container will be assembled and started.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Manage</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is for doing things to specific components of an array such as adding new spares and removing faulty devices.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Misc</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is an 'everything else' mode that supports operations on active arrays, operations on component devices such as erasing old superblocks, and information gathering operations.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Auto-detect</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This mode does not act on a specific device or array, but rather it requests the Linux Kernel to activate any auto-detected arrays.</p>
  </dd>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">Options for selecting a mode are:</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-A</strong>, <strong>--assemble</strong></p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>-I</strong>, <strong>--incremental</strong></p>

  <dd>
    <p>Add/remove a single device to/from an appropriate array, and possibly start the array.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--auto-detect</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Request that the kernel starts any auto-detected arrays.  This can only work if <em>md</em> is compiled into the kernel &ndash; not if it is a module. Arrays can be auto-detected by the kernel if all the components are in primary MS-DOS partitions with partition type <strong>FD</strong>, and all use v0.90 metadata. In-kernel autodetect is not recommended for new installations.  Using <em>mdadm</em> to detect and assemble arrays &ndash; possibly in an <em>initrd</em> &ndash; is substantially more flexible and should be preferred.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>If a device is given before any options, or if the first option is and of <strong>--add</strong>, <strong>--re-add</strong>, <strong>--add-spare</strong>, <strong>--fail</strong>, <strong>--remove</strong>, or <strong>--replace</strong>, then the MANAGE mode is assumed. Anything other than these will cause the <strong>Misc</strong> mode to be assumed.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">Options that are not mode-specific are:</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Display general help message or, after one of the above options, a mode-specific help message.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--help-options</strong></p>

    <p>Print version information for mdadm.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-v</strong>, <strong>--verbose</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Be more verbose about what is happening.  This can be used twice to be extra-verbose. The extra verbosity currently only affects <strong>--detail --scan</strong> and <strong>--examine --scan</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-q</strong>, <strong>--quiet</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Avoid printing purely informative messages.  With this, <em>mdadm</em> will be silent unless there is something really important to report.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-f</strong>, <strong>--force</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Be more forceful about certain operations.  See the various modes for the exact meaning of this option in different contexts.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-c</strong>, <strong>--config=</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify the config file or directory.  Default is to use <strong>/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf</strong> and <strong>/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf.d</strong>, or if those are missing then <strong>/etc/mdadm.conf</strong> and <strong>/etc/mdadm.conf.d</strong>. If the config file given is <strong>partitions</strong> then nothing will be read, but <em>mdadm</em> will act as though the config file contained exactly</p><p><strong>    DEVICE partitions containers</strong></p><p>and will read <strong>/proc/partitions</strong> to find a list of devices to scan, and <strong>/proc/mdstat</strong> to find a list of containers to examine. If the word <strong>none</strong> is given for the config file, then <em>mdadm</em> will act as though the config file were empty.</p><p>If the name given is of a directory, then <em>mdadm</em> will collect all the files contained in the directory with a name ending in <strong>.conf</strong>, sort them lexically, and process all of those files as config files.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-s</strong>, <strong>--scan</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Scan config file or <strong>/proc/mdstat</strong> for missing information. In general, this option gives <em>mdadm</em> permission to get any missing information (like component devices, array devices, array identities, and alert destination) from the configuration file (see previous option); one exception is MISC mode when using <strong>--detail</strong> or <strong>--stop,</strong> in which case <strong>--scan</strong> says to get a list of array devices from <strong>/proc/mdstat</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-e</strong>, <strong>--metadata=</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Declare the style of RAID metadata (superblock) to be used.  The default is 1.2 for <strong>--create</strong>, and to guess for other operations. The default can be overridden by setting the <strong>metadata</strong> value for the <strong>CREATE</strong> keyword in <strong>mdadm.conf</strong>.</p><p>Options are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    0, 0.90, default
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    0, 0.90
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use the original 0.90 format superblock.  This format limits arrays to 28 component devices and limits component devices of levels 1 and greater to 2 terabytes.  It is also possible for there to be confusion about whether the superblock applies to a whole device or just the last partition, if that partition starts on a 64K boundary.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    1, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    1, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 default
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use the new version-1 format superblock.  This has fewer restrictions. It can easily be moved between hosts with different endian-ness, and a recovery operation can be checkpointed and restarted.  The different sub-versions store the superblock at different locations on the device, either at the end (for 1.0), at the start (for 1.1) or 4K from the start (for 1.2).  "1" is equivalent to "1.2" (the commonly preferred 1.x format).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    ddf
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use the "Industry Standard" DDF (Disk Data Format) format defined by SNIA. When creating a DDF array a <strong>CONTAINER</strong> will be created, and normal arrays can be created in that container.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    imsm
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use the Intel(R) Matrix Storage Manager metadata format.  This creates a <strong>CONTAINER</strong> which is managed in a similar manner to DDF, and is supported by an option-rom on some platforms:</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>http://www.intel.com/design/chipsets/matrixstorage_sb.htm</strong></p>
  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--homehost=</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This will override any <strong>HOMEHOST</strong> setting in the config file and provides the identity of the host which should be considered the home for any arrays.</p><p>When creating an array, the <strong>homehost</strong> will be recorded in the metadata.  For version-1 superblocks, it will be prefixed to the array name.  For version-0.90 superblocks, part of the SHA1 hash of the hostname will be stored in the later half of the UUID.</p><p>When reporting information about an array, any array which is tagged for the given homehost will be reported as such.</p><p>When using Auto-Assemble, only arrays tagged for the given homehost will be allowed to use 'local' names (i.e. not ending in '_' followed by a digit string).  See below under <strong>Auto Assembly</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--prefer=</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When <em>mdadm</em> needs to print the name for a device it normally finds the name in <strong>/dev</strong> which refers to the device and is shortest.  When a path component is given with <strong>--prefer</strong> <em>mdadm</em> will prefer a longer name if it contains that component.  For example <strong>--prefer=by-uuid</strong> will prefer a name in a subdirectory of <strong>/dev</strong> called <strong>by-uuid</strong>.</p><p>This functionality is currently only provided by <strong>--detail</strong> and <strong>--monitor</strong>.</p>
  </dd>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">For create, build, or grow:</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-n</strong>, <strong>--raid-devices=</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify the number of active devices in the array.  This, plus the number of spare devices (see below) must equal the number of <em>component-devices</em> (including "<strong>missing</strong>" devices) that are listed on the command line for <strong>--create</strong>. Setting a value of 1 is probably a mistake and so requires that <strong>--force</strong> be specified first.  A value of 1 will then be allowed for linear, multipath, RAID0 and RAID1.  It is never allowed for RAID4, RAID5 or RAID6.</p><p>This number can only be changed using <strong>--grow</strong> for RAID1, RAID4, RAID5 and RAID6 arrays, and only on kernels which provide the necessary support.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-x</strong>, <strong>--spare-devices=</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify the number of spare (eXtra) devices in the initial array. Spares can also be added and removed later.  The number of component devices listed on the command line must equal the number of RAID devices plus the number of spare devices.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-z</strong>, <strong>--size=</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Amount (in Kibibytes) of space to use from each drive in RAID levels 1/4/5/6. This must be a multiple of the chunk size, and must leave about 128Kb of space at the end of the drive for the RAID superblock. If this is not specified (as it normally is not) the smallest drive (or partition) sets the size, though if there is a variance among the drives of greater than 1%, a warning is issued.</p><p>A suffix of 'M' or 'G' can be given to indicate Megabytes or Gigabytes respectively.</p><p>Sometimes a replacement drive can be a little smaller than the original drives though this should be minimised by IDEMA standards. Such a replacement drive will be rejected by <em>md</em>. To guard against this it can be useful to set the initial size slightly smaller than the smaller device with the aim that it will still be larger than any replacement.</p><p>This value can be set with <strong>--grow</strong> for RAID level 1/4/5/6 though <strong>CONTAINER</strong> based arrays such as those with IMSM metadata may not be able to support this. If the array was created with a size smaller than the currently active drives, the extra space can be accessed using <strong>--grow</strong>. The size can be given as <strong>max</strong> which means to choose the largest size that fits on all current drives.</p><p>Before reducing the size of the array (with <strong>--grow --size=</strong>) you should make sure that space isn't needed.  If the device holds a filesystem, you would need to resize the filesystem to use less space.</p><p>After reducing the array size you should check that the data stored in the device is still available.  If the device holds a filesystem, then an 'fsck' of the filesystem is a minimum requirement.  If there are problems the array can be made bigger again with no loss with another <strong>--grow --size=</strong> command.</p><p>This value cannot be used when creating a <strong>CONTAINER</strong> such as with DDF and IMSM metadata, though it perfectly valid when creating an array inside a container.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-Z</strong>, <strong>--array-size=</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is only meaningful with <strong>--grow</strong> and its effect is not persistent: when the array is stopped and restarted the default array size will be restored.</p><p>Setting the array-size causes the array to appear smaller to programs that access the data.  This is particularly needed before reshaping an array so that it will be smaller.  As the reshape is not reversible, but setting the size with <strong>--array-size</strong> is, it is required that the array size is reduced as appropriate before the number of devices in the array is reduced.</p><p>Before reducing the size of the array you should make sure that space isn't needed.  If the device holds a filesystem, you would need to resize the filesystem to use less space.</p><p>After reducing the array size you should check that the data stored in the device is still available.  If the device holds a filesystem, then an 'fsck' of the filesystem is a minimum requirement.  If there are problems the array can be made bigger again with no loss with another <strong>--grow --array-size=</strong> command.</p><p>A suffix of 'M' or 'G' can be given to indicate Megabytes or Gigabytes respectively. A value of <strong>max</strong> restores the apparent size of the array to be whatever the real amount of available space is.</p>

Obviously some of these are synonymous.</p><p>When a <strong>CONTAINER</strong> metadata type is requested, only the <strong>container</strong> level is permitted, and it does not need to be explicitly given.</p><p>When used with <strong>--build</strong>, only linear, stripe, raid0, 0, raid1, multipath, mp, and faulty are valid.</p><p>Can be used with <strong>--grow</strong> to change the RAID level in some cases.

  <dd>
    <p>This option configures the fine details of data layout for RAID5, RAID6, and RAID10 arrays, and controls the failure modes for <em>faulty</em>.</p><p>The layout of the RAID5 parity block can be one of <strong>left-asymmetric</strong>, <strong>left-symmetric</strong>, <strong>right-asymmetric</strong>, <strong>right-symmetric</strong>, <strong>la</strong>, <strong>ra</strong>, <strong>ls</strong>, <strong>rs</strong>. The default is <strong>left-symmetric</strong>.</p><p>It is also possible to cause RAID5 to use a RAID4-like layout by choosing <strong>parity-first</strong>, or <strong>parity-last</strong>.</p><p>Finally for RAID5 there are DDF-compatible layouts, <strong>ddf-zero-restart</strong>, <strong>ddf-N-restart</strong>, and <strong>ddf-N-continue</strong>.</p><p>These same layouts are available for RAID6.  There are also 4 layouts that will provide an intermediate stage for converting between RAID5 and RAID6.  These provide a layout which is identical to the corresponding RAID5 layout on the first N-1 devices, and has the 'Q' syndrome (the second 'parity' block used by RAID6) on the last device. These layouts are: <strong>left-symmetric-6</strong>, <strong>right-symmetric-6</strong>, <strong>left-asymmetric-6</strong>, <strong>right-asymmetric-6</strong>, and <strong>parity-first-6</strong>.</p><p>When setting the failure mode for level <em>faulty,</em> the options are: <strong>write-transient</strong>, <strong>wt</strong>, <strong>read-transient</strong>, <strong>rt</strong>, <strong>write-persistent</strong>, <strong>wp</strong>, <strong>read-persistent</strong>, <strong>rp</strong>, <strong>write-all</strong>, <strong>read-fixable</strong>, <strong>rf</strong>, <strong>clear</strong>, <strong>flush</strong>, <strong>none</strong>.</p><p>Each failure mode can be followed by a number, which is used as a period between fault generation.  Without a number, the fault is generated once on the first relevant request.  With a number, the fault will be generated after that many requests, and will continue to be generated every time the period elapses.</p><p>Multiple failure modes can be current simultaneously by using the <strong>--grow</strong> option to set subsequent failure modes.</p><p>"clear" or "none" will remove any pending or periodic failure modes, and "flush" will clear any persistent faults.</p><p>Finally, the layout options for RAID10 are one of 'n', 'o' or 'f' followed by a small number.  The default is 'n2'.  The supported options are:</p><p><em>'n'</em> signals 'near' copies.  Multiple copies of one data block are at similar offsets in different devices.</p><p><em>'o'</em> signals 'offset' copies.  Rather than the chunks being duplicated within a stripe, whole stripes are duplicated but are rotated by one device so duplicate blocks are on different devices.  Thus subsequent copies of a block are in the next drive, and are one chunk further down.</p><p><em>'f'</em> signals 'far' copies (multiple copies have very different offsets). See md(4) for more detail about 'near', 'offset', and 'far'.</p><p>The number is the number of copies of each datablock.  2 is normal, 3 can be useful.  This number can be at most equal to the number of devices in the array.  It does not need to divide evenly into that number (e.g. it is perfectly legal to have an 'n2' layout for an array with an odd number of devices).</p><p>When an array is converted between RAID5 and RAID6 an intermediate RAID6 layout is used in which the second parity block (Q) is always on the last device.  To convert a RAID5 to RAID6 and leave it in this new layout (which does not require re-striping) use <strong>--layout=preserve</strong>. This will try to avoid any restriping.</p><p>The converse of this is <strong>--layout=normalise</strong> which will change a non-standard RAID6 layout into a more standard arrangement.</p>

    <p>Tell <em>mdadm</em> that the array pre-existed and is known to be clean.

It can also be used when creating a RAID1 or RAID10 if you want to avoid the initial resync, however this practice &ndash; while normally safe &ndash; is not recommended.  Use this only if you really know what you are doing.</p><ul>
<li><p>When the devices that will be part of a new array were filled with zeros before creation the operator knows the array is actually clean.

    <p>This is needed when <strong>--grow</strong> is used to increase the number of raid-devices in a RAID5 or RAID6 if there are no spare devices available, or to shrink, change RAID level or layout.

  <dd>
    <p>Arrays with 1.x metadata can leave a gap between the start of the device and the start of array data.  This gap can be used for various metadata.  The start of data is known as the <em>data-offset</em>. Normally an appropriate data offset is computed automatically. However it can be useful to set it explicitly such as when re-creating an array which was originally created using a different version of <em>mdadm</em> which computed a different offset.</p><p>Setting the offset explicitly over-rides the default.  The value given is in Kilobytes unless an 'M' or 'G' suffix is given.</p><p>Since Linux 3.4, <strong>--data-offset</strong> can also be used with <strong>--grow</strong> for some RAID levels (initially on RAID10).  This allows the data-offset to be changed as part of the reshape process.  When the data offset is changed, no backup file is required as the difference in offsets is used to provide the same functionality.</p><p>When the new offset is earlier than the old offset, the number of devices in the array cannot shrink.  When it is after the old offset, the number of devices in the array cannot increase.</p><p>When creating an array, <strong>--data-offset</strong> can be specified as <strong>variable</strong>. In the case each member device is expected to have a offset appended to the name, separated by a colon.  This makes it possible to recreate exactly an array which has varying data offsets (as can happen when different versions of <em>mdadm</em> are used to add different devices).</p>

The name is a simple textual string that can be used to identify array components when assembling.

"md" causes a non-partitionable array to be used (though since Linux 2.6.28, these array devices are in fact partitionable).  "mdp", "part" or "p" causes a partitionable array (2.6 and later) to be used.  "yes" requires the named md device to have a 'standard' format, and the type and minor number will be determined from this.  With mdadm 3.0, device creation is normally left up to <em>udev</em> so this option is unlikely to be needed. See DEVICE NAMES below.</p><p>The argument can also come immediately after "-a".  e.g. "-ap".</p><p>If <strong>--auto</strong> is not given on the command line or in the config file, then the default will be <strong>--auto=yes</strong>.</p><p>If <strong>--scan</strong> is also given, then any <em>auto=</em> entries in the config file will override the <strong>--auto</strong> instruction given on the command line.</p><p>For partitionable arrays, <em>mdadm</em> will create the device file for the whole array and for the first 4 partitions.  A different number of partitions can be specified at the end of this option (e.g. <strong>--auto=p7</strong>). If the device name ends with a digit, the partition names add a 'p', and a number, e.g. <em>/dev/md/home1p3</em>. If there is no trailing digit, then the partition names just have a number added, e.g. <em>/dev/md/scratch3</em>.</p><p>If the md device name is in a 'standard' format as described in DEVICE NAMES, then it will be created, if necessary, with the appropriate device number based on that name.  If the device name is not in one of these formats, then a unused device number will be allocated.  The device number will be considered unused if there is no active array for that number, and there is no entry in /dev for that number and with a non-standard name.  Names that are not in 'standard' format are only allowed in "/dev/md/".</p><p>This is meaningful with <strong>--create</strong> or <strong>--build</strong>.</p>

    <p>This option can be used in Grow mode in two cases.</p><p>If the target array is a Linear array, then <strong>--add</strong> can be used to add one or more devices to the array.  They are simply catenated on to the end of the array.  Once added, the devices cannot be removed.</p><p>If the <strong>--raid-disks</strong> option is being used to increase the number of devices in an array, then <strong>--add</strong> can be used to add some extra devices to be included in the array. In most cases this is not needed as the extra devices can be added as spares first, and then the number of raid-disks can be changed. However for RAID0, it is not possible to add spares.  So to increase the number of devices in a RAID0, it is necessary to set the new number of devices, and to add the new devices, in the same command.</p>

This kernel got the alignment of part of the superblock wrong.  You can use the <strong>--examine --sparc2.2</strong> option to <em>mdadm</em> to see what effect this would have.</p><p>The <strong>super-minor</strong> option will update the <strong>preferred minor</strong> field on each superblock to match the minor number of the array being assembled. This can be useful if <strong>--examine</strong> reports a different "Preferred Minor" to <strong>--detail</strong>. In some cases this update will be performed automatically by the kernel driver.  In particular the update happens automatically at the first write to an array with redundancy (RAID level 1 or greater) on a 2.6 (or later) kernel.</p><p>The <strong>uuid</strong> option will change the uuid of the array.  If a UUID is given with the <strong>--uuid</strong> option that UUID will be used as a new UUID and will <strong>NOT</strong> be used to help identify the devices in the array. If no <strong>--uuid</strong> is given, a random UUID is chosen.</p><p>The <strong>name</strong> option will change the <em>name</em> of the array as stored in the superblock.  This is only supported for version-1 superblocks.</p><p>The <strong>homehost</strong> option will change the <em>homehost</em> as recorded in the superblock.  For version-0 superblocks, this is the same as updating the UUID. For version-1 superblocks, this involves updating the name.</p><p>The <strong>resync</strong> option will cause the array to be marked <em>dirty</em> meaning that any redundancy in the array (e.g. parity for RAID5, copies for RAID1) may be incorrect.  This will cause the RAID system to perform a "resync" pass to make sure that all redundant information is correct.</p><p>The <strong>byteorder</strong> option allows arrays to be moved between machines with different byte-order. When assembling such an array for the first time after a move, giving <strong>--update=byteorder</strong> will cause <em>mdadm</em> to expect superblocks to have their byteorder reversed, and will correct that order before assembling the array.  This is only valid with original (Version 0.90) superblocks.</p><p>The <strong>summaries</strong> option will correct the summaries in the superblock.  That is the counts of total, working, active, failed, and spare devices.</p><p>The <strong>devicesize</strong> option will rarely be of use.  It applies to version 1.1 and 1.2 metadata only (where the metadata is at the start of the device) and is only useful when the component device has changed size (typically become larger).  The version 1 metadata records the amount of the device that can be used to store data, so if a device in a version 1.1 or 1.2 array becomes larger, the metadata will still be visible, but the extra space will not.  In this case it might be useful to assemble the array with <strong>--update=devicesize</strong>. This will cause <em>mdadm</em> to determine the maximum usable amount of space on each device and update the relevant field in the metadata.</p><p>The <strong>metadata</strong> option only works on v0.90 metadata arrays and will convert them to v1.0 metadata.  The array must not be dirty (i.e. it must not need a sync) and it must not have a write-intent bitmap.</p><p>The old metadata will remain on the devices, but will appear older than the new metadata and so will usually be ignored. The old metadata (or indeed the new metadata) can be removed by giving the appropriate <strong>--metadata=</strong> option to <strong>--zero-superblock</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>no-bitmap</strong> option can be used when an array has an internal bitmap which is corrupt in some way so that assembling the array normally fails.  It will cause any internal bitmap to be ignored.</p><p>The <strong>bbl</strong> option will reserve space in each device for a bad block list.  This will be 4K in size and positioned near the end of any free space between the superblock and the data.</p><p>The <strong>no-bbl</strong> option will cause any reservation of space for a bad block list to be removed.  If the bad block list contains entries, this will fail, as removing the list could cause data corruption.</p>

    <p>Option is intended to be used in start-up scripts during initrd boot phase.

If the array is degraded, it will immediately start to rebuild data onto that spare.</p><p>Note that this and the following options are only meaningful on array with redundancy.  They don't apply to RAID0 or Linear.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--re-add</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>re-add a device that was previously removed from an array. If the metadata on the device reports that it is a member of the array, and the slot that it used is still vacant, then the device will be added back to the array in the same position.  This will normally cause the data for that device to be recovered.  However based on the event count on the device, the recovery may only require sections that are flagged a write-intent bitmap to be recovered or may not require any recovery at all.</p><p>When used on an array that has no metadata (i.e. it was built with <strong>--build)</strong> it will be assumed that bitmap-based recovery is enough to make the device fully consistent with the array.</p><p>When used with v1.x metadata, <strong>--re-add</strong> can be accompanied by <strong>--update=devicesize</strong>, <strong>--update=bbl</strong>, or <strong>--update=no-bbl</strong>. See the description of these option when used in Assemble mode for an explanation of their use.</p><p>If the device name given is <strong>missing</strong> then <em>mdadm</em> will try to find any device that looks like it should be part of the array but isn't and will try to re-add all such devices.</p><p>If the device name given is <strong>faulty</strong> then <em>mdadm</em> will find all devices in the array that are marked <strong>faulty</strong>, remove them and attempt to immediately re-add them.  This can be useful if you are certain that the reason for failure has been resolved.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--add-spare</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Add a device as a spare.  This is similar to <strong>--add</strong> except that it does not attempt <strong>--re-add</strong> first.  The device will be added as a spare even if it looks like it could be an recent member of the array.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-r</strong>, <strong>--remove</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>remove listed devices.  They must not be active.  i.e. they should be failed or spare devices.</p><p>As well as the name of a device file (e.g. <strong>/dev/sda1</strong>) the words <strong>failed</strong>, <strong>detached</strong> and names like <strong>set-A</strong> can be given to <strong>--remove</strong>. The first causes all failed device to be removed.  The second causes any device which is no longer connected to the system (i.e an 'open' returns <strong>ENXIO</strong>) to be removed. The third will remove a set as describe below under <strong>--fail</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-f</strong>, <strong>--fail</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Mark listed devices as faulty. As well as the name of a device file, the word <strong>detached</strong> or a set name like <strong>set-A</strong> can be given.  The former will cause any device that has been detached from the system to be marked as failed.  It can then be removed.</p><p>For RAID10 arrays where the number of copies evenly divides the number of devices, the devices can be conceptually divided into sets where each set contains a single complete copy of the data on the array. Sometimes a RAID10 array will be configured so that these sets are on separate controllers.  In this case all the devices in one set can be failed by giving a name like <strong>set-A</strong> or <strong>set-B</strong> to <strong>--fail</strong>. The appropriate set names are reported by <strong>--detail</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--set-faulty</strong></p>

  <dd>
    <p>same as <strong>--fail</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--replace</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Mark listed devices as requiring replacement.  As soon as a spare is available, it will be rebuilt and will replace the marked device. This is similar to marking a device as faulty, but the device remains in service during the recovery process to increase resilience against multiple failures.  When the replacement process finishes, the replaced device will be marked as faulty.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--with</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This can follow a list of <strong>--replace</strong> devices.  The devices listed after <strong>--with</strong> will be preferentially used to replace the devices listed after <strong>--replace</strong>. These device must already be spare devices in the array.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--write-mostly</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Subsequent devices that are added or re-added will have the 'write-mostly' flag set.  This is only valid for RAID1 and means that the 'md' driver will avoid reading from these devices if possible.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--readwrite</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Subsequent devices that are added or re-added will have the 'write-mostly' flag cleared.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Each of these options requires that the first device listed is the array to be acted upon, and the remainder are component devices to be added, removed, marked as faulty, etc.  Several different operations can be specified for different devices, e.g. mdadm /dev/md0 --add /dev/sda1 --fail /dev/sdb1 --remove /dev/sdb1 Each operation applies to all devices listed until the next operation.</p><p>If an array is using a write-intent bitmap, then devices which have been removed can be re-added in a way that avoids a full reconstruction but instead just updates the blocks that have changed since the device was removed.  For arrays with persistent metadata (superblocks) this is done automatically.  For arrays created with <strong>--build</strong> mdadm needs to be told that this device we removed recently with <strong>--re-add</strong>.</p><p>Devices can only be removed from an array if they are not in active use, i.e. that must be spares or failed devices.  To remove an active device, it must first be marked as <strong>faulty.</strong></p>

<p>Usage: <strong>mdadm --assemble</strong> <em>md-device options-and-component-devices...</em> Usage: <strong>mdadm --assemble --scan</strong> <em>md-devices-and-options...</em> Usage: <strong>mdadm --assemble --scan</strong> <em>options...</em></p><p>This usage assembles one or more RAID arrays from pre-existing components. For each array, mdadm needs to know the md device, the identity of the array, and a number of component-devices.  These can be found in a number of ways.</p><p>In the first usage example (without the <strong>--scan</strong>) the first device given is the md device. In the second usage example, all devices listed are treated as md devices and assembly is attempted. In the third (where no devices are listed) all md devices that are listed in the configuration file are assembled.  If no arrays are described by the configuration file, then any arrays that can be found on unused devices will be assembled.</p><p>If precisely one device is listed, but <strong>--scan</strong> is not given, then <em>mdadm</em> acts as though <strong>--scan</strong> was given and identity information is extracted from the configuration file.</p><p>The identity can be given with the <strong>--uuid</strong> option, the <strong>--name</strong> option, or the <strong>--super-minor</strong> option, will be taken from the md-device record in the config file, or will be taken from the super block of the first component-device listed on the command line.</p><p>Devices can be given on the <strong>--assemble</strong> command line or in the config file.  Only devices which have an md superblock which contains the right identity will be considered for any array.</p><p>The config file is only used if explicitly named with <strong>--config</strong> or requested with (a possibly implicit) <strong>--scan</strong>. In the later case, <strong>/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf</strong> or <strong>/etc/mdadm.conf</strong> is used.</p><p>If <strong>--scan</strong> is not given, then the config file will only be used to find the identity of md arrays.</p><p>Normally the array will be started after it is assembled.  However if <strong>--scan</strong> is not given and not all expected drives were listed, then the array is not started (to guard against usage errors).  To insist that the array be started in this case (as may work for RAID1, 4, 5, 6, or 10), give the <strong>--run</strong> flag.</p><p>If <em>udev</em> is active, <em>mdadm</em> does not create any entries in <strong>/dev</strong> but leaves that to <em>udev</em>. It does record information in <strong>/run/mdadm/map</strong> which will allow <em>udev</em> to choose the correct name.</p><p>If <em>mdadm</em> detects that udev is not configured, it will create the devices in <strong>/dev</strong> itself.</p><p>In Linux kernels prior to version 2.6.28 there were two distinctly different types of md devices that could be created: one that could be partitioned using standard partitioning tools and one that could not. Since 2.6.28 that distinction is no longer relevant as both type of devices can be partitioned. <em>mdadm</em> will normally create the type that originally could not be partitioned as it has a well defined major number (9).</p><p>Prior to 2.6.28, it is important that mdadm chooses the correct type of array device to use.  This can be controlled with the <strong>--auto</strong> option.  In particular, a value of "mdp" or "part" or "p" tells mdadm to use a partitionable device rather than the default.</p><p>In the no-udev case, the value given to <strong>--auto</strong> can be suffixed by a number.  This tells <em>mdadm</em> to create that number of partition devices rather than the default of 4.</p><p>The value given to <strong>--auto</strong> can also be given in the configuration file as a word starting <strong>auto=</strong> on the ARRAY line for the relevant array.</p><h3>Auto Assembly</h3>
<p>When <strong>--assemble</strong> is used with <strong>--scan</strong> and no devices are listed, <em>mdadm</em> will first attempt to assemble all the arrays listed in the config file.</p><p>If no arrays are listed in the config (other than those marked <strong>&lt;ignore&gt;</strong>) it will look through the available devices for possible arrays and will try to assemble anything that it finds.  Arrays which are tagged as belonging to the given homehost will be assembled and started normally.  Arrays which do not obviously belong to this host are given names that are expected not to conflict with anything local, and are started "read-auto" so that nothing is written to any device until the array is written to. i.e.  automatic resync etc is delayed.</p><p>If <em>mdadm</em> finds a consistent set of devices that look like they should comprise an array, and if the superblock is tagged as belonging to the given home host, it will automatically choose a device name and try to assemble the array.  If the array uses version-0.90 metadata, then the <strong>minor</strong> number as recorded in the superblock is used to create a name in <strong>/dev/md/</strong> so for example <strong>/dev/md/3</strong>. If the array uses version-1 metadata, then the <strong>name</strong> from the superblock is used to similarly create a name in <strong>/dev/md/</strong> (the name will have any 'host' prefix stripped first).</p><p>This behaviour can be modified by the <em>AUTO</em> line in the <em>mdadm.conf</em> configuration file.  This line can indicate that specific metadata type should, or should not, be automatically assembled.  If an array is found which is not listed in <em>mdadm.conf</em> and has a metadata format that is denied by the <em>AUTO</em> line, then it will not be assembled. The <em>AUTO</em> line can also request that all arrays identified as being for this homehost should be assembled regardless of their metadata type. See <a href="../man5/mdadm.conf.5.html"><strong>mdadm.conf</strong>(5)</a> for further details.</p><p>Note: Auto assembly cannot be used for assembling and activating some arrays which are undergoing reshape.  In particular as the <strong>backup-file</strong> cannot be given, any reshape which requires a backup-file to continue cannot be started by auto assembly.  An array which is growing to more devices and has passed the critical section can be assembled using auto-assembly.</p>

This feature can be overridden with the <strong>--force</strong> option.</p><p>When creating an array with version-1 metadata a name for the array is required. If this is not given with the <strong>--name</strong> option, <em>mdadm</em> will choose a name based on the last component of the name of the device being created.  So if <strong>/dev/md3</strong> is being created, then the name <strong>3</strong> will be chosen. If <strong>/dev/md/home</strong> is being created, then the name <strong>home</strong> will be used.</p><p>When creating a partition based array, using <em>mdadm</em> with version-1.x metadata, the partition type should be set to <strong>0xDA</strong> (non fs-data).  This type selection allows for greater precision since using any other [RAID auto-detect (0xFD) or a GNU/Linux partition (0x83)], might create problems in the event of array recovery through a live cdrom.</p><p>A new array will normally get a randomly assigned 128bit UUID which is very likely to be unique.  If you have a specific need, you can choose a UUID for the array by giving the <strong>--uuid=</strong> option.  Be warned that creating two arrays with the same UUID is a recipe for disaster.  Also, using <strong>--uuid=</strong> when creating a v0.90 array will silently override any <strong>--homehost=</strong> setting.</p><p>If the array type supports a write-intent bitmap, and if the devices in the array exceed 100G is size, an internal write-intent bitmap will automatically be added unless some other option is explicitly requested with the <strong>--bitmap</strong> option.  In any case space for a bitmap will be reserved so that one can be added layer with <strong>--grow --bitmap=internal</strong>.</p><p>If the metadata type supports it (currently only 1.x metadata), space will be allocated to store a bad block list.  This allows a modest number of bad blocks to be recorded, allowing the drive to remain in service while only partially functional.</p><p>When creating an array within a <strong>CONTAINER</strong> <em>mdadm</em> can be given either the list of devices to use, or simply the name of the container.  The former case gives control over which devices in the container will be used for the array.  The latter case allows <em>mdadm</em> to automatically choose which devices to use based on how much spare space is available.</p><p>The General Management options that are valid with <strong>--create</strong> are:</p>

For <strong>MoveSpare</strong> the second device is the array that the spare was moved from.</p><p>For <em>mdadm</em> to move spares from one array to another, the different arrays need to be labeled with the same <strong>spare-group</strong> or the spares must be allowed to migrate through matching POLICY domains in the configuration file.  The <strong>spare-group</strong> name can be any string; it is only necessary that different spare groups use different names.</p><p>When <em>mdadm</em> detects that an array in a spare group has fewer active devices than necessary for the complete array, and has no spare devices, it will look for another array in the same spare group that has a full complement of working drive and a spare.  It will then attempt to remove the spare from the second drive and add it to the first. If the removal succeeds but the adding fails, then it is added back to the original array.</p><p>If the spare group for a degraded array is not defined, <em>mdadm</em> will look at the rules of spare migration specified by POLICY lines in <strong>mdadm.conf</strong> and then follow similar steps as above if a matching spare is found.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">GROW MODE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The GROW mode is used for changing the size or shape of an active array. For this to work, the kernel must support the necessary change. Various types of growth are being added during 2.6 development.</p><p>Currently the supported changes include</p><ul>
<li><p>change the "size" attribute for RAID1, RAID4, RAID5 and RAID6.</p></li><li><p>increase or decrease the "raid-devices" attribute of RAID0, RAID1, RAID4, RAID5, and RAID6.</p></li><li><p>change the chunk-size and layout of RAID0, RAID4, RAID5, RAID6 and RAID10.</p></li><li><p>convert between RAID1 and RAID5, between RAID5 and RAID6, between RAID0, RAID4, and RAID5, and between RAID0 and RAID10 (in the near-2 mode).</p></li><li><p>add a write-intent bitmap to any array which supports these bitmaps, or remove a write-intent bitmap from such an array.</p></li>
</ul><p>Using GROW on containers is currently supported only for Intel's IMSM container format.  The number of devices in a container can be increased - which affects all arrays in the container - or an array in a container can be converted between levels where those levels are supported by the container, and the conversion is on of those listed above.  Resizing arrays in an IMSM container with <strong>--grow --size</strong> is not yet supported.</p><p>Grow functionality (e.g. expand a number of raid devices) for Intel's IMSM container format has an experimental status. It is guarded by the <strong>MDADM_EXPERIMENTAL</strong> environment variable which must be set to '1' for a GROW command to succeed. This is for the following reasons:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    1.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Intel's native IMSM check-pointing is not fully tested yet. This can causes IMSM incompatibility during the grow process: an array which is growing cannot roam between Microsoft Windows(R) and Linux systems.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    2.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Interrupting a grow operation is not recommended, because it has not been fully tested for Intel's IMSM container format yet.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Note: Intel's native checkpointing doesn't use <strong>--backup-file</strong> option and it is transparent for assembly feature.</p><h3>SIZE CHANGES</h3>
<p>Normally when an array is built the "size" is taken from the smallest of the drives.  If all the small drives in an arrays are, one at a time, removed and replaced with larger drives, then you could have an array of large drives with only a small amount used.  In this situation, changing the "size" with "GROW" mode will allow the extra space to start being used.  If the size is increased in this way, a "resync" process will start to make sure the new parts of the array are synchronised.</p><p>Note that when an array changes size, any filesystem that may be stored in the array will not automatically grow or shrink to use or vacate the space.  The filesystem will need to be explicitly told to use the extra space after growing, or to reduce its size <strong>prior</strong> to shrinking the array.</p><p>Also the size of an array cannot be changed while it has an active bitmap.  If an array has a bitmap, it must be removed before the size can be changed. Once the change is complete a new bitmap can be created.</p>
<h3>RAID-DEVICES CHANGES</h3>
<p>A RAID1 array can work with any number of devices from 1 upwards (though 1 is not very useful).  There may be times which you want to increase or decrease the number of active devices.  Note that this is different to hot-add or hot-remove which changes the number of inactive devices.</p><p>When reducing the number of devices in a RAID1 array, the slots which are to be removed from the array must already be vacant.  That is, the devices which were in those slots must be failed and removed.</p><p>When the number of devices is increased, any hot spares that are present will be activated immediately.</p><p>Changing the number of active devices in a RAID5 or RAID6 is much more effort.  Every block in the array will need to be read and written back to a new location.  From 2.6.17, the Linux Kernel is able to increase the number of devices in a RAID5 safely, including restarting an interrupted "reshape".  From 2.6.31, the Linux Kernel is able to increase or decrease the number of devices in a RAID5 or RAID6.</p><p>From 2.6.35, the Linux Kernel is able to convert a RAID0 in to a RAID4 or RAID5. <em>mdadm</em> uses this functionality and the ability to add devices to a RAID4 to allow devices to be added to a RAID0.  When requested to do this, <em>mdadm</em> will convert the RAID0 to a RAID4, add the necessary disks and make the reshape happen, and then convert the RAID4 back to RAID0.</p><p>When decreasing the number of devices, the size of the array will also decrease.  If there was data in the array, it could get destroyed and this is not reversible, so you should firstly shrink the filesystem on the array to fit within the new size.  To help prevent accidents, <em>mdadm</em> requires that the size of the array be decreased first with <strong>mdadm --grow --array-size</strong>. This is a reversible change which simply makes the end of the array inaccessible.  The integrity of any data can then be checked before the non-reversible reduction in the number of devices is request.</p><p>When relocating the first few stripes on a RAID5 or RAID6, it is not possible to keep the data on disk completely consistent and crash-proof.  To provide the required safety, mdadm disables writes to the array while this "critical section" is reshaped, and takes a backup of the data that is in that section.  For grows, this backup may be stored in any spare devices that the array has, however it can also be stored in a separate file specified with the <strong>--backup-file</strong> option, and is required to be specified for shrinks, RAID level changes and layout changes.  If this option is used, and the system does crash during the critical period, the same file must be passed to <strong>--assemble</strong> to restore the backup and reassemble the array.  When shrinking rather than growing the array, the reshape is done from the end towards the beginning, so the "critical section" is at the end of the reshape.</p>
<h3>LEVEL CHANGES</h3>
<p>Changing the RAID level of any array happens instantaneously.  However in the RAID5 to RAID6 case this requires a non-standard layout of the RAID6 data, and in the RAID6 to RAID5 case that non-standard layout is required before the change can be accomplished.  So while the level change is instant, the accompanying layout change can take quite a long time.  A <strong>--backup-file</strong> is required.  If the array is not simultaneously being grown or shrunk, so that the array size will remain the same - for example, reshaping a 3-drive RAID5 into a 4-drive RAID6 - the backup file will be used not just for a "cricital section" but throughout the reshape operation, as described below under LAYOUT CHANGES.</p>
<h3>CHUNK-SIZE AND LAYOUT CHANGES</h3>
<p>Changing the chunk-size of layout without also changing the number of devices as the same time will involve re-writing all blocks in-place. To ensure against data loss in the case of a crash, a <strong>--backup-file</strong> must be provided for these changes.  Small sections of the array will be copied to the backup file while they are being rearranged.  This means that all the data is copied twice, once to the backup and once to the new layout on the array, so this type of reshape will go very slowly.</p><p>If the reshape is interrupted for any reason, this backup file must be made available to <strong>mdadm --assemble</strong> so the array can be reassembled.  Consequently the file cannot be stored on the device being reshaped.</p>
<h3>BITMAP CHANGES</h3>
<p>A write-intent bitmap can be added to, or removed from, an active array.  Either internal bitmaps, or bitmaps stored in a separate file, can be added.  Note that if you add a bitmap stored in a file which is in a filesystem that is on the RAID array being affected, the system will deadlock.  The bitmap must be on a separate filesystem.</p>

If a specific metadata version is requested with <strong>--metadata</strong> or <strong>-e</strong> then only that style of metadata is accepted, otherwise <em>mdadm</em> finds any known version of metadata.  If no <em>md</em> metadata is found, the device may be still added to an array as a spare if POLICY allows.</p></li>
</ul><p><em>mdadm</em> keeps a list of arrays that it has partially assembled in <strong>/run/mdadm/map</strong>. If no array exists which matches the metadata on the new device, <em>mdadm</em> must choose a device name and unit number.  It does this based on any name given in <strong>mdadm.conf</strong> or any name information stored in the metadata.  If this name suggests a unit number, that number will be used, otherwise a free unit number will be chosen.  Normally <em>mdadm</em> will prefer to create a partitionable array, however if the <strong>CREATE</strong> line in <strong>mdadm.conf</strong> suggests that a non-partitionable array is preferred, that will be honoured.</p><p>If the array is not found in the config file and its metadata does not identify it as belonging to the "homehost", then <em>mdadm</em> will choose a name for the array which is certain not to conflict with any array which does belong to this host.  It does this be adding an underscore and a small number to the name preferred by the metadata.</p><p>Once an appropriate array is found or created and the device is added, <em>mdadm</em> must decide if the array is ready to be started.  It will normally compare the number of available (non-spare) devices to the number of devices that the metadata suggests need to be active.  If there are at least that many, the array will be started.  This means that if any devices are missing the array will not be restarted.</p><p>As an alternative, <strong>--run</strong> may be passed to <em>mdadm</em> in which case the array will be run as soon as there are enough devices present for the data to be accessible.  For a RAID1, that means one device will start the array.  For a clean RAID5, the array will be started as soon as all but one drive is present.</p><p>Note that neither of these approaches is really ideal.  If it can be known that all device discovery has completed, then</p><p><strong>   mdadm -IRs</strong></p><p>can be run which will try to start all arrays that are being incrementally assembled.  They are started in "read-auto" mode in which they are read-only until the first write request.  This means that no metadata updates are made and no attempt at resync or recovery happens.  Further devices that are found before the first write can still be added safely.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">ENVIRONMENT</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>This section describes environment variables that affect how mdadm operates.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MDADM_NO_MDMON</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Setting this value to 1 will prevent mdadm from automatically launching mdmon.  This variable is intended primarily for debugging mdadm/mdmon.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MDADM_NO_UDEV</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally, <em>mdadm</em> does not create any device nodes in /dev, but leaves that task to <em>udev</em>. If <em>udev</em> appears not to be configured, or if this environment variable is set to '1', the <em>mdadm</em> will create and devices that are needed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MDADM_NO_SYSTEMCTL</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If <em>mdadm</em> detects that <em>systemd</em> is in use it will normally request <em>systemd</em> to start various background tasks (particularly <em>mdmon</em>) rather than forking and running them in the background.  This can be suppressed by setting <strong>MDADM_NO_SYSTEMCTL=1</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>IMSM_NO_PLATFORM</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A key value of IMSM metadata is that it allows interoperability with boot ROMs on Intel platforms, and with other major operating systems. Consequently, <em>mdadm</em> will only allow an IMSM array to be created or modified if detects that it is running on an Intel platform which supports IMSM, and supports the particular configuration of IMSM that is being requested (some functionality requires newer OROM support).</p><p>These checks can be suppressed by setting IMSM_NO_PLATFORM=1 in the environment.  This can be useful for testing or for disaster recovery.  You should be aware that interoperability may be compromised by setting this value.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MDADM_GROW_ALLOW_OLD</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If an array is stopped while it is performing a reshape and that reshape was making use of a backup file, then when the array is re-assembled <em>mdadm</em> will sometimes complain that the backup file is too old.  If this happens and you are certain it is the right backup file, you can over-ride this check by setting <strong>MDADM_GROW_ALLOW_OLD=1</strong> in the environment.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MDADM_CONF_AUTO</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Any string given in this variable is added to the start of the <strong>AUTO</strong> line in the config file, or treated as the whole <strong>AUTO</strong> line if none is given.  It can be used to disable certain metadata types when <em>mdadm</em> is called from a boot script.  For example</p><p><strong>    export MDADM_CONF_AUTO='-ddf -imsm'</strong></p><p>will make sure that <em>mdadm</em> does not automatically assemble any DDF or IMSM arrays that are found.  This can be useful on systems configured to manage such arrays with <strong>dmraid</strong>.</p>

<h3>/proc/mdstat</h3>
<p>If you're using the <strong>/proc</strong> filesystem, <strong>/proc/mdstat</strong> lists all active md devices with information about them. <em>mdadm</em> uses this to find arrays when <strong>--scan</strong> is given in Misc mode, and to monitor array reconstruction on Monitor mode.</p>
<h3>/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf (or /etc/mdadm.conf)</h3>
<p>The config file lists which devices may be scanned to see if they contain MD super block, and gives identifying information (e.g. UUID) about known MD arrays.  See <a href="../man5/mdadm.conf.5.html"><strong>mdadm.conf</strong>(5)</a> for more details.</p>
<h3>/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf.d (or /etc/mdadm.conf.d)</h3>
<p>A directory containing configuration files which are read in lexical order.</p>
<h3>/run/mdadm/map</h3>
<p>When <strong>--incremental</strong> mode is used, this file gets a list of arrays currently being created.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DEVICE NAMES</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><em>mdadm</em> understand two sorts of names for array devices.</p><p>The first is the so-called 'standard' format name, which matches the names used by the kernel and which appear in <em>/proc/mdstat</em>.</p><p>The second sort can be freely chosen, but must reside in <em>/dev/md/</em>. When giving a device name to <em>mdadm</em> to create or assemble an array, either full path name such as <em>/dev/md0</em> or <em>/dev/md/home</em> can be given, or just the suffix of the second sort of name, such as <em>home</em> can be given.</p><p>When <em>mdadm</em> chooses device names during auto-assembly or incremental assembly, it will sometimes add a small sequence number to the end of the name to avoid conflicted between multiple arrays that have the same name.  If <em>mdadm</em> can reasonably determine that the array really is meant for this host, either by a hostname in the metadata, or by the presence of the array in <strong>mdadm.conf</strong>, then it will leave off the suffix if possible. Also if the homehost is specified as <strong>&lt;ignore&gt;</strong> <em>mdadm</em> will only use a suffix if a different array of the same name already exists or is listed in the config file.</p><p>The standard names for non-partitioned arrays (the only sort of md array available in 2.4 and earlier) are of the form</p><ul>
<li><p>/dev/md<strong>NN</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>where NN is a number. The standard names for partitionable arrays (as available from 2.6 onwards) are of the form:</p><ul>
<li><p>/dev/md_d<strong>NN</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>Partition numbers should be indicated by adding "pMM" to these, thus "/dev/md/d1p2".</p><p>From kernel version 2.6.28 the "non-partitioned array" can actually be partitioned.  So the "md_d<strong>NN</strong>" names are no longer needed, and partitions such as "/dev/md<strong>NN</strong>p<strong>XX</strong>" are possible.</p><p>From kernel version 2.6.29 standard names can be non-numeric following the form:</p><ul>
<li><p>/dev/md_<strong>XXX</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>where <strong>XXX</strong> is any string.  These names are supported by <em>mdadm</em> since version 3.3 provided they are enabled in <em>mdadm.conf</em>.</p>
