        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Net news is a world-wide information exchange service covering numerous topics in science and every day life.  Topics are organized in <em>news&nbsp;groups</em>, and these groups are open for everybody to post <em>articles</em> on a subject related to the topic of the group.</p><p><em>Nn</em> is a `point-and-shoot' net news interface program, or a <em>news reader</em> for short (not to be confused with the <em>human</em> news reader).  When you use <em>nn</em>, you can decide which of the many news groups you are interested in, and you can unsubscribe to those which don't interest you.  <em>nn</em> will let you read the new (and old) articles in each of the groups you subscribe to using a menu based article selection prior to reading the articles in the news group.</p><p>When a news group is entered, <em>nn</em> will locate all the presently unread articles in the group, and extract their sender, subject, and other relevant information.  This information is then rearranged, sorted, and marked in various ways to give it a pleasant format when it is presented on the screen.</p><p>This will be done very quickly, because <em>nn</em> uses the NOV database via the NNTP <strong>XOVER</strong> command. The news server to use can be overridden by setting the environment variable <em>$NNTPSERVER</em> to the name of the system (such as <strong>news.newserver.com</strong>), or by setting the variable <em>nntp-server</em> (on the command line only, since it is looked at before the init file), as "nntp-server=news.some.domain"). If you use multiple servers, you probably want to set the <em>nn-directory</em> and <em>newsrc</em> variables on the command line to an alternate names as well, since some of the data files are server dependent. If you are using a slow tcp link (such as <em>ppp</em> over a modem) and <strong>NNTP</strong>, see the <strong>NOTES</strong> section at the end of this manual.</p><p>When the article menu appears on the screen, <em>nn</em> will be in a mode called <strong>selection mode</strong>.  In this mode, the articles which seems to be interesting can be selected by single keystrokes (using the keys a-z and 0-9).  When all the interesting articles among the ones presently displayed have been selected, the space bar is hit, which causes <em>nn</em> to enter reading mode.</p><p>In <strong>reading mode</strong>, each of the selected articles will be presented. You use the <strong>space bar</strong> to go on to the next page of the current article, or to the next article.  Of course, there are all sorts of commands to scroll text up and down, skip to the next article, responding to an article, decrypt an article, and so on.</p><p>When all the selected articles in the current group have been read, the last hit on the space bar will cause <em>nn</em> will continue to the next group with unread articles, and enter selection mode on that group.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">FREQUENTLY USED OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><em>nn</em> accepts a lot of command line options, but here only the frequently used options are described.  Options can also be set permanently by including appropriate <em>variable</em> settings in the <em>init</em> file described later.  All options are described in the section on Command Line Options towards the end of this manual.</p><p>The frequently used command line options are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>-<strong>a0</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Catch up on unread articles and groups.  See the section "Catch up" below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-<strong>g</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Prompt for the name of a news group or folder to be entered (with completion).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-<strong>r</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Used with -<strong>g</strong> to repeatedly prompt for groups to enter.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-<strong>l</strong><em>N</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Print only the first <em>N</em> lines of the first page of each article before prompting to continue.  This is useful on slow terminals and modem lines to be able to see the first few lines of longer articles.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-<strong>s</strong><em>WORD</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Collect only articles which contain the string <em>WORD</em> in their subject (case is ignored).  This is normally combined with the -x and -m options to find all articles on a specific subject.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-<strong>s/</strong><em>regexp</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Collect only articles whose subject matches the regular expression <em>regexp</em>. This is normally combined with the -x and -m options to find all articles on a specific subject.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-<strong>n</strong><em>WORD</em> or -<strong>n/</strong><em>regexp</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Same as -<strong>s</strong> except that it matches on the sender's name instead of the article's subject. This is normally combined with the -x and -m options to find all articles from a specific author.  It cannot be mixed with the -<strong>s</strong> option!</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-<strong>i</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally searches with -<strong>n</strong> and -<strong>s</strong> are case independent. Using this option, the case becomes significant.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-<strong>m</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Merge all articles into one `meta group' instead of showing them one group at a time.  This is normally used together with the -x and -s options to get all the articles on a specific subject presented on a single menu (when you don't care about which group they belong to).  When -m is used, no articles will be marked as read.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-<strong>x</strong>[<em>N</em>]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Present (or scan) all (or the last <em>N</em>) unread as well as read articles.  When this option is used, <em>nn</em> will <em>never</em> mark unread articles as read (i.e. .newsrc is not updated).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-<strong>X</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Read/scan unsubscribed groups also.  Most useful when looking for a specific subject in <strong>all</strong> groups, e.g.</p>
<pre>
	nn -mxX -sSubject all
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>news.group</em>  or  <em>file</em>  or  <em>+folder</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If none of these arguments are given, all subscribed news groups will be used.  Otherwise, only the specified news groups and/or files will be collected and presented.  In specifying a news groups, the following `meta notation' can be used:</p><p>If the news group ends with a `.' (or `.all'), all subgroups of the news group will be collected, e.g.</p>
<pre>
	comp.sources.
</pre>
<p>If a news group starts with a `.' (or `all.'), all the matching subgroups will be collected, e.g.</p>
<pre>
	.sources.unix
</pre>
<p>The argument `all' identifies all (subscribed) news groups.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">COMMAND INPUT</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>In general, <em>nn</em> commands consist of one or two key-strokes, and <em>nn</em> reacts instantly to the commands you give it; you don't have to enter <strong>return</strong> after each command (except where explicitly stated).</p><p>Some commands have more serious effects than others, and therefore <em>nn</em> requests you to confirm the command.  You confirm by hitting the the <strong>y</strong> key, and reject by hitting the <strong>n</strong> key.  Some `trivial' requests may also be confirmed simply by hitting <strong>space.</strong> For example, to confirm the creation of a save file, just hit <strong>space,</strong> but if one or more directories also have to be created, you must enter <strong>y.</strong></p><p>Many commands will require that you enter a line of text, e.g. a file name or a shell command.  If you enter <strong>space</strong> as the first character on a line, the line will be filled with a default value (if one is defined).  For example, the default value for a file name is the last file name you have entered, and the default shell command is your previous shell command.  You can edit this default value as well as a directly typed text, using the following editing commands.  The <strong>erase</strong>, <strong>kill</strong>, and <strong>interrupt</strong> keys are the keys defined by the current tty settings.  On systems without job control, the <strong>suspend</strong> key will be <strong>control-Z</strong> while it is the current suspend character on system with job control.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>erase</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Delete the last character on the line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>delete-word</strong>   (normally ^W)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Delete the last word or component of the input.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>kill</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Delete all characters on the line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>interrupt</strong>  and  <strong>control-G</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Cancel the command which needs the input.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>suspend</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Suspend <em>nn</em> if supported by the system.  Otherwise, spawn an interactive shell.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>return</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Terminate the line, and continue with the command.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">BASIC COMMANDS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>There are numerous commands in <em>nn</em>, and most of them can be invoked by a single keystroke.  The descriptions in this manual are based on the standard bindings of the commands to the keys, but it is possible to customize these using the <strong>map</strong> command described later.  For each of the keystroke commands described in this manual, the corresponding command name will also be shown in curly braces, e.g. {<strong>command</strong>}.</p><p>The following commands work in both selection mode and in reading mode.  The notation ^X means `control X':</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>?</strong>	{<strong>help</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Help.  Gives a one page overview of the commands available in the current mode.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>^L</strong>	{<strong>redraw</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Redraw screen.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>^R</strong>	{<strong>redraw</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Redraw screen (Same as ^L).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>^P</strong>	{<strong>message</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Repeat the last message shown on the message line.  The command can be repeated to successively show previous messages (the maximum number of saved messages is controlled via the <strong>message-history</strong> variable.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>!</strong>	{<strong>shell</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Shell escape.  The user is prompted for a command which is executed by your favorite shell (see the <strong>shell</strong> variable).  Shell escapes are described in detail later on.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Q</strong>	{<strong>quit</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Quit <em>nn</em>.  When you use this command, you neither lose unread articles in the current group nor the selections you might have made (unless the articles are expired in the meantime of course).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>V</strong>	{<strong>version</strong>}</p>
  </dt>

    <p>Print release and version information.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>:</strong><em>command</em>  {<strong>command</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Execute the <em>command</em> by name.  This form can be used to invoke any of <em>nn</em>'s commands, also those which cannot be bound to a key (such as <strong>:coredump</strong>), or those which are not bound to a key by default (such as <strong>post</strong> and <strong>unshar</strong>).</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">SELECTION MODE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>In selection mode, the screen is divided into four parts: the header line showing the name of the news group and the number of articles, the menu lines which show the collected articles - one article per line, the prompt line where you enter commands, and the message line where <em>nn</em> prints various messages to you.</p><p>Each menu line begins with an <em>article id</em> which is a unique letter (or digit if your screen can show more than 26 menu lines).  To select an articles for reading, you simply enter the corresponding <em>id</em>, and the menu line will be high-lighted to indicate that the article is selected.  When you have selected all the interesting articles on the present menu, you simply hit <strong>space</strong>.</p><p>If there are more articles collected for the current group than could be presented on one screenful of text, you will be presented with the next portion of articles to select from.  When you have had the opportunity to select among all the articles in the group, hitting <strong>space</strong> will enter reading mode.</p><p>If no articles have been selected in the current group, hitting <strong>space</strong> will enter selection mode on the next news group, or exit <em>nn</em> if the current group was the last news group with unread articles. It is thus possible to go through ALL unread articles (without reading any of them) just by hitting <strong>space</strong> a few times.</p><p>The articles will be presented on the menu using one of the following layouts:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>0:</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>x Name.........  Subject.............. +123</em></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>1:</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>x Name.........   123  Subject..............</em></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>2:</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>x 123  Subject...................................</em></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>3:</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>x Subject...........................................</em></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>4:</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>x    Subject........................................</em></p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Here <em>x</em> is the letter or digit that must be entered to select the article, <em>Name</em> is the real name of the sender (or the mail address if the real name cannot be found), <em>Subject</em> is the contents of the "Subject:" line in the article, and <em>123</em> is the number of lines in the article.</p><p>Layout 0 and 1 are just two ways to present the same information, while layout 2 and 3 are intended for groups whose articles have very long subject lines, e.g. comp.sources.</p><p>Layout 4 is a hybrid between layout 1 and 3.  It will normally use layout 1, but it will use layout 3 (with a little indentation) for menu lines where the subject is longer than the space available with layout 1.</p><p>Layout 1 is the default layout, and an alternative menu line layout is selected using the -<strong>L</strong> option or by setting the <strong>layout</strong> variable.  Once <em>nn</em> is started the layout can be changed at any time using the <strong>"</strong> key {<strong>layout</strong>}.</p><p>The <em>Name</em> is limited to 16 characters, and to make maximum use of this space, <em>nn</em> will perform a series of simplifications on the name, e.g. changing first names into initials, removing domain names from mail addresses (if the real name is not found) etc.  It does a good job, but some people on the net put weird things into the From: field (or actually into their password file) which result in <em>nn</em> producing quite cryptic, and sometimes funny "names".</p><p>One a usual 80 column terminal, the <em>Subject</em> is limited to about 60 characters (75 in layout 3) and is thus only an approximation to the actual subject line which may be much longer.  To get as much out of this space, <em>Re:</em> prefixes (in various forms) are recognized and replaced by a single `&gt;' character (see the <strong>re-layout</strong> variable).</p><p>Since articles are sorted according to the subject, two or more adjacent articles may share the same subject (ignoring any `&gt;'s).  In this case, only the first article will show the subject of the article; the rest will only show the `&gt;' character in the subject field (or a `-' if there is no `&gt;' at the beginning of the line).  A typical menu will thus only show each subject once, saving a lot of time in scanning the news articles.</p><p>If <em>consolidated menus</em> (see section below) are enabled, adjacent articles sharing the same subject will be shown with a <em>single</em> line on the menu corresponding to the <em>first</em> of the articles. The number of articles with the same subject will be shown as a braketed number in front of the subject, e.g. with layout 1:</p>
<pre>
	<em>x Name.........   123  [4] Subject..............</em>
</pre>
<p>For further information see the section on consolidated menus below.</p><p><strong>Related variables</strong>: collapse-subject, columns, confirm-entry, confirm-entry-limit, entry-report-limit, fsort, kill, layout, limit, lines, long-menu, re-layout, repeat, slow-mode, sort, sort-mode, split, subject-match-limit, subject-match-offset, subject-match-parts, subject-match-minimum.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">ARTICLE ATTRIBUTES</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>While <em>nn</em> is running and between invocations, <em>nn</em> associates an <em>attribute</em> with each article on your system.  These attributes are used to differentiate between read and unread articles, selected articles, articles marked for later treatment, etc.  Depending on how <em>nn</em> is configured, these attributes can be saved between invocations of <em>nn</em>, or some of them may only be used while <em>nn</em> is running.</p><p>The attribute is shown on the menu using either a single character following the <em>article id</em> or by high-lighting the menu line, depending on the attribute and the capabilities of the terminal.  You can also change the attributes to your own taste (see the <strong>attributes</strong> variable).</p><p>The attribute of an article can be changed explicitly using the selection mode commands described below, or it will change automatically for example when you have read or saved a selected article. If a command may change any article attributes, it will be noted in the description of the command.  The following descriptions of the attributes will only mention the most important commands that may set (or preserve) the attribute.</p><p>The following attributes may be associated with an article:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>read</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Menu attribute "." - indicates that the article has been read or saved. When you leave the group, these articles will be marked permanently read, and are not presented the next time you enter the group.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>seen</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Menu attribute "," - indicates that the article is unread, but that it has been <em>presented</em> on a menu.  Depending on how <em>nn</em> is configured, these articles will automatically be marked <em>read</em> when you leave the group, they may remain <em>seen</em>, or they may just be <em>unread</em> the next time you enter the group (see the <strong>auto-junk-seen</strong>, <strong>confirm-junk-seen</strong>, and <strong>retain-seen-status</strong> variables).</p><p>Only the commands <strong>continue</strong> (<strong>space</strong>) and <strong>read-skip</strong> (<strong>X</strong>) will mark <em>unread</em> articles on the current (or all) menu pages as <em>seen</em> when they are used.  Other commands that scroll through the menu pages or enter reading mode will let unread articles remain unread.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>unread</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Menu attribute " " - indicates an unread article.  These articles were unread when you entered the group, and they may remain unread when you leave the group, unless they have been marked <em>seen</em> by the command that you used to leave the group or enter reading mode.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>selected</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Menu line high-lighted (or menu attribute "*") - indicates that you have selected the article.  If you leave the group, the selected articles will remain selected the next time you enter the group.  When you have read a selected article, the attribute will automatically change to <em>read</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>auto-selected</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>These articles have the same appearance as <em>selected</em> articles on the menu, and the only difference is that these articles have been selected automatically via the auto-selection facility rather than manually by you.  Very few commands differentiate between these attributes and if they do, it is explicitly stated in this manual. The main difference is that these articles are only marked as <em>unread</em> when you leave the group (supposing they will also be auto-selected the next the group is entered).  This simplifies the house-keeping between invocations of <em>nn</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>leave</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Menu attribute "+" - indicates that the article is marked for later treatment by the <strong>leave-article</strong> (<strong>l</strong>) command.  These articles may be selected (on demand) when you have read all selected articles in a group.  However, if you do not select them then immediately, they are stored as the <strong>leave-next</strong> attribute described below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>leave-next</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Menu attribute "=" - indicates that the article is marked for later treatment by the <strong>leave-next</strong> (<strong>L</strong>) command.  This is a permanent attribute, which will remain on the article until you either read the article, change the attribute, or it is expired.  So assinging this attribute to an article will effectively keep it unread until <em>you</em> do something.  If the variable <strong>select-leave-next</strong> is set, <em>nn</em> will ask whether these articles should be <strong>selected</strong> on entry to a group (but naturally, doing so will change the <strong>leave-next</strong> attribute to <strong>select</strong>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>cancelled</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Menu attribute "#" - indicates that the article has been cancelled. This is mainly useful when tidying a folder; it is set by the <strong>cancel</strong> (<strong>C</strong>) command, and can be cleared by any command that change attributes, e.g. you can select and deselect the article.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>killed</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Menu attribute "!" - indicates that the article has been killed (e.g. by the <strong>K</strong> {<strong>kill-select</strong>} command).  Killed articles are immediately removed from the menu, so you should not normally see articles with this attribute.  If you do, report it as a bug!</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The attributes are saved in two files: .newsrc (<em>read</em> articles) and .nn/select (other attributes).  Plain <em>unread</em> articles are saved by not occurring in either of these files.  Both files are described in more detail later on.</p><p><strong>Related variables</strong>: attributes, auto-junk-seen, confirm-junk-seen, retain-seen-status, select-leave-next.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">SELECTION MODE COMMANDS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The primary purpose of the selection mode is of course to select the articles to be read, but numerous other commands may also be performed in this mode: saving of articles in files, replying and following up on articles, mailing/forwarding articles, shell escapes etc.</p><p>As described above, the <em>selected</em> articles are marked either by showing the corresponding menu line in standout mode (reverse video), or if the terminal does not have this capability by placing an asterisk (*) after the selection letter or digit.</p><p>Most commands which are used to select articles will work as toggle commands.  If the article is not already selected, the <em>selected</em>attribute on the article(s), independent on the previous attribute.  Otherwise, the article(s) will be <em>deselected</em> and marked <em>unread</em>.  Consequently, any article can be marked <em>unread</em> simply be selecting and deselecting it.</p><p>During selection, the cursor will normally be placed on the article following the last article whose attribute was changed (initially the first article).  The article pointed out by the cursor is called the <em>current article</em>, and the following commands work relative to the current article and cursor position.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>abc...z 01..9</strong>  {<em>article N</em>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The article with the given identification letter or digit is selected or deselected.  The following article becomes the current article.  If the variable <strong>auto-select-subject</strong> is set, all articles with the same subject as the given article are selected.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>.</strong>	{<strong>select</strong>}</p>
  </dt>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>*</strong>	{<strong>select-subject</strong>}</p>

<p>The following commands may change the attributes on all articles on the current menu page, or on all articles on all menu pages.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>~</strong>	{<strong>unselect-all</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Deselect all <em>auto-selected</em> articles in the group (this works across all menu pages).  If the command is executed twice, the <em>selected</em> articles will also be deselected.</p>

    <p><strong>=</strong>	{<strong>find</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Prompts for a regular expression, and selects all articles on the menu (all pages) which matches the regular expression.  Depending on the variable <strong>select-on-sender</strong> matching is performed against the subject (default) or the sender of the articles.  An empty answer (<strong>= return</strong>) will reuse the previous expression. Example:  The command <strong>= . return</strong> will select <em>all</em> articles in the group.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>J</strong>	{<strong>junk-articles</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a very versatile command which can be used to perform all sorts of attribute changes, either on individual articles, all articles on the current menu page, all articles with a specific attribute, or all available articles.  To access all the functions of this command, the <strong>J</strong> key may have to be hit up to four times, to loop through different one-line menus.  The full functionality of the <strong>junk-articles</strong> command is described in a separate section below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>L</strong>	{<strong>leave-next</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a specialized version of the generic <strong>J</strong> {<strong>junk-articles</strong>} command to set the <em>leave-next</em> attribute on a subset of the articles on the menu.  It is also described further below.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The following commands move between the pages belonging to the same news group when there are more articles than will fit on a single page.  These commands will not change any article attributes.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>

</dl>
<p>The following commands are used to enter reading mode for the selected articles, and to move between news groups (in selection mode).  They may change article attributes if noted below.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>space</strong>	{<strong>continue</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Continue to next menu page, or if on last menu page, read the selected articles.  If no articles have been selected, continue to the next news group.  The <em>unread</em> articles on the current menu page will automatically be marked <em>seen</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>return</strong>	{<strong>continue-no-mark</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Identical to the <strong>continue</strong> command, except that the <em>unread</em> articles on the current menu page will remain <em>unread</em>. (The <strong>newline</strong> key has the same effect).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Z</strong>	{<strong>read-return</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enter reading mode <em>immediately</em> with the currently selected articles.  When all articles have been read, return to selection mode in the <em>current</em> group.  It will mark <em>selected</em> articles <em>read</em> as they are read, but <em>unread</em> articles are not normally changed (can be controlled with the variable <strong>marked-by-read-return</strong>.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>X</strong>	{<strong>read-skip</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Mark all <em>unmarked</em> articles <em>seen</em> on all menu pages (or the pages defined by the <strong>marked-by-read-skip</strong> variable), and enter reading mode <em>immediately</em> with the currently selected articles. As the selected articles are read, they are marked <em>read</em>.  When all selected articles have been read, <em>nn</em> will enter selection mode in the <em>next</em> news group.  <strong>When no articles are selected,</strong> it goes directly to the next group.  This can be used to skip all the articles in a large news group without having to go through all the menu pages.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>If you don't want to read the current group now, but want to keep it for later, you can use the following commands which will only mark <em>seen</em> and <em>read</em> articles as read.  Currently selected articles will still be selected the next time you enter the group. None of these commands will change any attributes themselves (by default).</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>N</strong>	{<strong>next-group</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Go forward to the next group in the presentation sequence.  If the variable <strong>marked-by-next-group</strong> is set articles on the menu can optionally be marked <em>seen</em></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>P</strong>	{<strong>previous</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Go back to the previous group.  This command will enter selection mode on the last active group (two P commands in sequence will bring you to the current group).  If there are still some <em>unread</em> articles in the group, only those articles will be shown.  Otherwise, all the articles which were unread when <em>nn</em> was invoked will be shown marked with the <em>read</em> attribute (which can be changed as usual).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>As described in the "Article Attributes" section, the <em>read</em> and <em>seen</em> articles will normally be marked read when you leave the group, and these articles are not shown the next time you enter the group.</p><p>In all releases prior to release 6.4, it was impossible to have individual articles in a group marked <em>unread</em> when you left a group, and the default behaviour of release 6.4 onwards will closely match the traditional behaviour.  This means that the <em>seen</em> and <em>read</em> articles are treated alike for most practical purposes with the default variable settings.</p><p>If you don't like <em>nn</em> to silently mark the <em>seen</em> articles read, you can <em>set</em> the variable <strong>confirm-junk-seen</strong> to get <em>nn</em> to prompt you for confirmation before doing this, or you can <em>unset</em> the variable <strong>auto-junk-seen</strong> to simply keep the seen articles for the next time you enter the group.  You then have to use the <strong>J</strong> {<strong>junk-articles</strong>} to mark articles read.</p><p>Using <strong>return</strong> {<strong>continue-no-mark</strong>} will also allow you to keep articles <em>unread</em> rather than marking them <em>seen</em> when scrolling through the menu pages and entering reading mode.  If this is your preferred reading style, you can remap <strong>space</strong> to this command.</p><p><strong>Related variables</strong>: auto-junk-seen, auto-preview-mode, auto-select-subject, case-fold-search, confirm-auto-quit, confirm-entry, confirm-junk-seen, marked-by-next-group, marked-by-read-return, marked-by-read-skip, retain-seen-status, select-on-sender.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">CONSOLIDATED MENUS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Normally, <em>nn</em> will use one menu line for each article, so if there are many articles with identical subjects, each menu page will only contain a few different subjects.  To have each subject occur only once on the menu, <em>nn</em> can operate with consolidated menus by setting the variable <strong>consolidated-menu</strong>.</p><p>When consolidated menus are used, <em>nn</em> operates with two kinds of subjects: open and closed.</p><p>An <em>open subject</em> is a subject which is shown in the traditional way with one menu line for each article with the given subject.  In other words, when consolidated menus are not used, all subjects are open (by default).</p><p>A <em>closed subject</em> is a multi-article subject which is presented by a single menu line.  This line will be the normal menu line for the first (oldest) article with the subject, but with the subject field annotated with a bracketed number showing the number of articles with that subject, e.g.</p>
<pre>
	a Kim F. Storm     12  [4] Future plans for nn
	b.Kim F. Storm     43  [3] More plans for nn
</pre>
<p>In this example, there are four unread articles with subject `a' of which the first is posted by me and has 12 lines.  The rest of the articles are hidden, and will only be shown on request.  The `.' marker on subject `b' shows that all three articles within that subject have been read (or seen).</p><p>To select (or deselect) ALL the articles within a closed subject, simply select the article shown on the menu; this will automatically select (or deselect) the rest (see auto-select-closed).  When all the unread articles within a closed subject are selected, the menu line will be high-lighted.</p><p>If you want to view the individual articles in a subject (maybe to select individual articles), you can open the subject with the commands:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>(x</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Open subject <em>x</em> on menu.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>((</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Open current subject.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>When you have completed viewing the opened subject, you can close it again using the commands:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>)x</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Close subject <em>x</em> on menu (<em>x</em> is any article with the subject).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>))</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Close current subject.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>In the basic layout of the menu line for a closed subject as shown above, ALL articles in the closed subject are supposed to be either:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>unread</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The menu line is <em>not</em> high-lighted.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>selected</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Menu line is fully high-lighted (if all UNREAD are selected).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>read/seen</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There is a `.' (read attribute) following the article id.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>If neither of these cases apply, i.e. there is a mixture of unread, selected, and seen/read articles, the bracketed number will have one of the following formats:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>[U:T]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There are U unread articles of T total (U&lt;T).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>[S/T]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There are S selected articles of T total (S&lt;U=T).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>[S/U:T]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There are S selected of U unread of T total (S&lt;U&lt;T).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>If there are any selected articles (S&gt;0), the information between the brackets will be high-lighted (to show that something is selected, but not all the unread articles).</p><p><strong>Notice</strong>:  Consolidated menus only work with the `subject' and `lexical' sorting methods.</p><p>Variables related to consolidated menus are: auto-select-closed, consolidated-menu, counter-delim-left, counter-delim-right, counter-padding, save-closed-mode.</p>

Using the commands described below will enter reading mode for one article only, and then return to the menu mode immediately after (depending on the setting of the <strong>preview-continuation</strong> variable).</p><p>If there are more than 5 free lines at the bottom of the menu screen, <em>nn</em> will use that space to show the article (a minimal preview window can be permanently allocated with the <strong>window</strong> variable).  Otherwise, the screen will be cleared to show the article.</p><p>After previewing an article, it will be marked read (if the <strong>preview-mark-read</strong> variable is set), and the following article will become the current article.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">SAVING ARTICLES</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The following commands are used to save articles in files, unpack archives, decode binaries, etc.  It is possible to use the commands in both reading mode to save the current article and in selection mode to save one or more articles on the menu.</p><p>The saved articles will be <em>appended</em> to the specified file(s) followed by an empty line each.  Both files and directories will be created as needed.  When an article has been saved in a file, a message reporting the number of lines saved will be shown if the <strong>save-report</strong> variable is set (default on).</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>S</strong>	{<strong>save-full</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Save articles including the full article header.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>O</strong>	{<strong>save-short</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Save articles with a short header containing only the name of the sender, the subject, and the posting date of the article.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>E</strong>	{<strong>save-header</strong>}</p>
  </dt>

    <p>Save only the header of the articles.</p>
  </dd>

    <p>Write article <em>without</em> a header.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>:print</strong>	{<strong>print</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Print article.  Instead of a file name, this command will prompt for the print command to which the current article will be piped.  The default print command is specified at compile time, but it can be changed by setting the <strong>printer</strong> variable.  The output will be identical to that of the <strong>O</strong> command.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>:patch</strong>	{<strong>patch</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Send articles through <a href="../man1/patch.1.html"><strong>patch</strong>(1)</a> (or the program defined in the <strong>patch-command</strong> variable).  Instead of a file name, you will be prompted for the name of a directory in which you want the patch command to be executed.  <em>nn</em> will then pipe the body of the article through the patch command.</p>
<pre>
  The output from the patch process will be shown on the screen and
</pre>
<p>also appended to a file named <em>Patch.Result</em> in the patch directory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>:unshar</strong>	{<strong>unshar</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Unshar articles.  You will be prompted for the name of a directory in which you want <em>nn</em> to unshar the articles.  <em>nn</em> will then pipe the proper parts of the article body into a Bourne Shell whose working directory will be set to the specified directory.</p>
<pre>
  During the unpacking, the normal output from the unshar process will
</pre>
<p>appear on the screen, and the menu or article text will be redrawn when the process is finished.</p>
<pre>
  The output is also appended to a file named <em>Unshar.Result</em> in
</pre>
<p>the unshar directory.</p>
<pre>
  The file specified in <strong>unshar-header-file</strong> (default
</pre>
<p>"Unshar.Headers") in the unshar directory will contain the header and initial text (before the shar data) from the article.  You can use the `G' {<strong>goto-group</strong>} command to look at the Unshar.Headers file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>:decode</strong>	{<strong>decode</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Decode <em>uuencoded</em> articles into binary files.  You will be prompted for the name of a directory in which you want <em>nn</em> to place the decoded binary files (the file names are taken from the uuencoded data).</p>
<pre>
  <em>nn</em> will combine several articles into single files as needed,
</pre>
<p>and you can even decode unrelated packages (into the same directory) with one <strong>decode</strong> command.</p>
<pre>
  To be able to decode a binary file which spans several articles,
</pre>
<p><em>nn</em> may have to <em>ignore</em> lines which fail the normal sanity checks on uuencoded data instead of treating them as <em>transmission errors</em>. Consequently, it is strongly recommended to check the resulting decoded file using the checksum which is normally contained in the original article.  (Actually, you are also supposed to do this after decoding with a stand-alone uudecode program).</p>
<pre>
  The header and initial information in the decoded articles are saved
</pre>
<p>in the file specified in <strong>decode-header-file</strong> (default "Decode.Headers") in the same directory as the decoded files.</p>
<pre>
  If <strong>decode-skip-prefix</strong> is non-null, <strong>:decode</strong> will attempt
</pre>
<p>to ignore up to that many characters on each line to find the encoded data. This is particularly useful in some binaries groups where files are both uuencoded and packed with shar; <em>nn</em> will ignore the prefix added to each line by shar, and thus be able to unshar, concatenate, and decode multi-part postings automatically.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>In reading mode, the following keys can also be used to invoke the save commands:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>s</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Same as <strong>S</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>P</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Same as <strong>:print</strong>.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The save commands will prompt for a file name which is expanded according to the rules described in the section on file name expansion below.  For each group, it is possible to specify a default save file in the init file, either in connection with the group presentation sequence or in a separate <strong>save-files</strong> section (see below). If a default save file is specified for the group, <em>nn</em> will show this on the prompt line when it prompts for the file name.  You can edit this name as usual, but if you kill the entire name immediately, <em>nn</em> will replace the default name with the last file name you entered.  If you kill this as well, <em>nn</em> will leave you with a blank line.</p><p>If the <strong>quick-save</strong> variable is set, <em>nn</em> will only prompt for a save file name when the current article is inside a folder; otherwise, the default save file defined in the init file will be used unconditionally.</p><p>If the file (and directories in the path) does not exist, <em>nn</em> will ask whether the file (and the directories) should be created.</p><p>If the file name contains an asterisk, e.g.</p>
<pre>
	part*.shar
</pre>
<p><em>nn</em> will save each of the articles in uniquely named files constructed by replacing the asterisk by numbers from the sequence 1, 2, 3, etc.  The format of the string that replaces the * can be changed with the <strong>save-counter</strong> variable, and the first number to use can be changed via <strong>save-counter-offset</strong>.</p><p>In <em>selection</em> mode, <em>nn</em> will prompt you for the identifier of one or more articles you want to save.  When you don't want to save more articles, just hit <strong>space</strong>.  The saved articles will be marked <em>read</em>.</p><p>If you enter an asterisk `*' when you are prompted for an article to save, <em>nn</em> will automatically save all the <em>selected</em> articles on the <em>current</em> menu page and mark them <em>read</em>.</p><p>Likewise, if you enter a plus `+', <em>nn</em> will save all the selected articles on <em>all</em> menu pages and mark them <em>read</em>.</p><p>This is very useful to unpack an entire package using the <strong>:unshar</strong> and <strong>:decode</strong> commands.  It can also be used in combination with the <em>save selected articles</em> feature to save a selection of articles in separate, successively numbered files.  But do not confuse these two concepts!  The <strong>S*</strong> and <strong>S+</strong> commands can be used to save the selected articles in a single file as well as in separate files, and the <em>save in separate files</em> feature can be used also when saving individual articles, either in the selection mode, or in the article reading mode.</p><p>When articles are saved in a file with a full or partial header, any header lines in the <em>body</em> of the article will be escaped by a tilde (e.g. ~From: ...) to enable <em>nn</em> to split the folder into separate articles. The escape string can be redefined via the <strong>embedded-header-escape</strong> variable.</p><p>Articles can optionally be saved in MAIL or MMDF compatible format by setting the <strong>mail-format</strong> and <strong>mmdf-format</strong> variables. These variables only specify the format used when creating a new folder, while appending to an existing folder will be done in the format of the folder (unless <strong>folder-format-check</strong> is false).</p><p><strong>Related variables</strong>: confirm-append, confirm-create, decode-header-file, decode-skip-prefix, default-save-file, folder-save-file, edit-patch-command, edit-print-command, edit-unshar-command, folder, folder-format-check, mail-format, mmdf-format, patch-command, printer, quick-save, save-counter, save-counter-offset, save-report, suggest-default-save, unshar-command, unshar-header-file.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>The <strong>+</strong> is replaced by the contents of the <strong>folder</strong> variable (default value "~/News/") resulting in the name of a file in the <em>folder</em> <em>directory</em>. Examples:</p>
<pre>
	+emacs, +nn, +sources/shar/nn
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>+</strong></p>
  </dt>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>~/</strong><em>file</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <strong>~</strong> is replaced by the contents of the environment variable HOME, i.e. the path name of your home directory. Examples:</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Instead of writing to a file, the articles are piped to the given shell (/bin/sh) command-line.  Each save or write command will create a separate pipe, but all articles saved or written in one command (in selection mode) are given as input to the same shell command.  Example:</p>
<pre>
	| pr | lp
</pre>
<p>This will print the articles on the printer after they have been piped through pr.</p>
<pre>
    It is possible to create separate pipes for each saved article by

<p>Using these symbols, a simple naming scheme for `default folder name' is <strong>+$G</strong> which will use the group name as folder name.  Another possibility is <strong>+$F/$N</strong>.</p><p>As mentioned above, you can also instruct <em>nn</em> to save a series of files in separate, unique files.  All that is required is that the file name contains an asterisk, e.g.</p>
<pre>
	+src/hype/part*.shar
</pre>
<p>This will cause each of the articles to be saved in separate, unique files named part1.shar, part2.shar, and so on, always choosing a part number that results in a unique file name (i.e. if part1.shar did already exist, the first article would be saved in part2.shar, the next in part3.shar, and so on).</p><p><strong>Related variables</strong>: default-save-file, folder, folder-save-file, save-counter, save-counter-offset.</p>

    <p>Reply through mail to the author of the article.  This is the preferred way to respond to an article unless you think your reply is of general interest.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>F</strong>	{<strong>follow</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Follow-up with an article in the same newsgroup (unless an alternative group is specified in the article header). The distribution of the follow-up is normally the same as the original article, but this can be modified via the <strong>follow-distribution</strong> variable.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>M</strong>	{<strong>mail</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Mail a letter or <em>forward</em> an article to a single recipient. In selection mode, you will be prompted for an article to include in your letter, and in reading mode you will be asked if the current article should be included in the letter. You will then be prompted for the recipient of the letter (default recipient is yourself) and the subject of the letter (if an article is included, you may hit <strong>space</strong> to get the default subject which is the subject of the included article).</p>
<pre>
  The header of the article is only included in the posted letter if
</pre>
<p>it is forwarded (i.e. not edited), or if the variable <strong>include-full-header</strong> is set.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>:post</strong>	{<strong>post</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Post a new article to any newsgroup.  This command will prompt you for a <em>comma-separated</em> list of newsgroups to post to (you cannot enter a space because <strong>space</strong> is used for group name completion as described below).</p>
<pre>
  If you enter <strong>?</strong> {<strong>help-key</strong>} as the first key, <em>nn</em>
</pre>
<p>will show you a list of all available news groups and their purpose. While paging through this list, you can enter <strong>q</strong> to quit looking at the list.  You can also enter <strong>/</strong> followed by a regular expression (typically a single word) which will cause <em>nn</em> to show a (much shorter) list containing only the lines matching the regular expression.</p>
<pre>
   Normally, you will be prompted for the distribution of the article
</pre>
<p>with the default take from <strong>default-distribution</strong>, but this can be changed via the <strong>post-distribution</strong> variable.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Generally, <em>nn</em> will construct a file with a suitable header, optionally include a copy of the article in the file with each non-empty line prefixed by a `&gt;' character (except in mail mode), and invoke an editor of your choice (using the EDITOR environment variable) on this file, positioning you on the first line of the body of the article (if it knows the editor).</p><p>When you have completed editing the message, it will compare it to the unedited file, and if they are identical (i.e. you did not make any changes to the file), or it is empty, the operation is cancelled. Otherwise you will be prompted for an action to take on the constructed article (enter first letter followed by <strong>return</strong>, or just <strong>return</strong> to take the default action):</p>
<pre>
    a)bort c)c e)dit h)old i)spell m)ail p)ost r)eedit s)end v)iew w)rite 7)bit
    Action: (post article)
</pre>
<p>You now have the opportunity to perform one of the following actions:</p><p><strong>a</strong>	throw the response away (will ask for confirmation),</p><p><strong>c</strong>	mail a copy of a <em>follow-up</em> to the poster of the article,</p><p><strong>e</strong>	edit the file again,</p><p><strong>h</strong>	hold response for later completion,</p><p><strong>i</strong>	run an (interactive) <strong>spell-checker</strong> on the text,</p><p><strong>m</strong>	mail a (blind) copy to a specified recipient,</p><p><strong>n</strong>	same as <strong>a</strong>bort (<em>no</em> don't post),</p><p><strong>p</strong>	post article (same as <strong>s</strong>end),</p><p><strong>r</strong>	throw away the edited text and edit the original text,</p><p><strong>s</strong>	send the article or letter,</p><p><strong>v</strong>	view the article (through the <strong>pager</strong>),</p><p><strong>w</strong>	append it to a file (before you send it),</p><p><strong>y</strong>	confirm <em>default answer</em> (e.g. <em>yes</em> post it), or</p><p><strong>7</strong>	strip the high-order bit from all characters in the message</p><p>If you have selected a 7-bit character set (this is determined by the values of the <strong>charset</strong> and <strong>data-bits</strong> variables), <em>nn</em> will not allow you to post an article or send a letter whose body contains characters with the high-order bit set. It will warn you after you have first edited the message and disable the c)c, m)ail, p)ost, s)end and y)es actions. You can then either e)dit the message to delete those characters, use 7)bit to strip the high-order bits, a)bort the message, or h)old it and select an 8-bit character set from <em>nn</em>.</p><p>To complete an unfinished response saved by the h)old command, simply enter any response action, e.g. <strong>R</strong> {<strong>reply</strong>}.  This will notice the unfinished response and ask you whether you want to complete it now.  Only one unfinished response can exist at a time. Notice that the $A environment variable may no longer be valid as a path to the original article when the response is completed.</p><p>If your message contains 8-bit characters, the <strong>charset</strong> variable is not set to "unknown" and the message does not already have a <strong>MIME-Version</strong> or <strong>Content-</strong><em>XXX</em> header, <em>nn</em> will add the following headers to your message before sending it:</p>
<pre>
	MIME-Version: 1.0
	Content-Type: text/plain; charset=<em>charset</em>
	Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
</pre>
<p>It must be noted that sending 8-bit characters over the current news and mail networks is risky at best; although large parts of the network will pass through such characters unchanged, high-order bits may occasionally be stripped. Although the MIME standard provides solutions for this by encoding the characters, this is not yet supported by <em>nn</em>. Adding the above headers is an interim solution that is compatible with current practice and is much better than just sending the message without any hints about the character set used.</p><p><strong>Related variables</strong>: append-signature-mail, append-signature-post, charset, data-bits, default-distribution, follow-distribution, post-distribution, edit-response-check, editor, include-art-id, include-full-header, included-mark, mail-header, mail-record, mail-script, mailer, mailer-pipe-input, news-header, news-record, news-script, orig-to-include-mask, pager, query-signature, record, response-check-pause, response-default-answer, save-counter, save-counter-offset, save-report, spell-checker.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">JUMPING TO OTHER GROUPS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>By default <em>nn</em> will present the news groups in a predefined sequence (see the section on Presentation Sequence later on). To override this sequence and have a look at any other group the <strong>G</strong> {<strong>goto-group</strong>} command available in both selection and reading mode enables you to move freely between all the newsgroups.</p><p>Furthermore, the <strong>G</strong> command enables you to open folders and other files, to read old articles you have read before, and to grep for a specific subject in a group.</p><p>It is important to notice that normally the goto command is recursive, i.e. a new <em>menu level</em> is created when the specified group or folder is presented, and when it has been read, <em>nn</em> will continue the activity in the group that was presented before the goto command was executed.  However, if there are unread articles in the target group you can avoid entering a new menu level by using the <strong>j</strong> reply described below.  The current menu level (i.e. number of nested goto commands) will be shown in the prompt line as "&lt;N&gt;" (in reverse video).</p><p>The goto command is very powerful, but unfortunately also a little bit tricky at first sight, because the facilities it provides depend on the context in which the command is used.</p><p>When executed, the goto command will prompt you for the name of the newsgroup, folder, or file to open.  It will use the first letter you enter to distinguish these three possibilities:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>return</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>An empty answer is equivalent to the current newsgroup.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>letter</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The answer is taken to be the name of a newsgroup. If a news group with the given name does not exist, <em>nn</em> will treat the answer as a regular expression and locate the first group in the presentation sequence (or among all groups) whose name matches the expression.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>+</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The answer is taken to be the name of a folder.  If only `+' is entered, it is equivalent to the default save file for the current group.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/ or ./ or ~/</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The answer is taken to be the name of a file, either relative to the current directory, relative to your home directory, or an absolute path name for the file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>%</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>In reading mode, this reply corresponds to reading the current article (and splitting it as a digest).  In selection mode, it will prompt for an article on the menu to read.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>@</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This choice is equivalent to the archive file for the current group.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>=</strong> and <em>number</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>These answers are equivalent to the same answers described below applied to the current group (e.g. <strong>G return =</strong> and <strong>G =</strong> are equivalent).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Specifying a folder, a file, or an article (with <strong>%</strong>) will cause <em>nn</em> to treat the file like a digest and split it into separate articles (not physically!)  which are then presented on a menu in the usual way, allowing you to read or save individual subarticles from the folder.</p><p>When you enter a group name, <em>nn</em> will ask you how many articles in the group you want to see on the menu.  You can give the following answers:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>a number N</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>In this case you will get the newest N articles in the group, or if you specified the current group (by hitting <strong>return</strong> to the group name prompt or entering the number directly), you will get that many <em>extra</em> articles included on the same menu (without creating a new menu level).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>j</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This answer can only be given if there are unread articles in the group.  It will instruct nn to jump directly to the specified group in the presentation sequence <em>without</em> creating a new menu level.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>u</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This instructs <em>nn</em> to present the <em>unread</em> articles in the group (if there are any).  If you have already read the group (in the current invocation of <em>nn</em>), the <strong>u</strong> answer will instruct <em>nn</em> to present the articles that were unread when you entered <em>nn</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>a</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This instruct <em>nn</em> to present <strong>all</strong> articles in the group.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>s</strong><em>word</em> or <strong>=</strong><em>word</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This instructs <em>nn</em> to search <em>all</em> articles in the groups, but only present the articles containing the word <em>word</em> in the subject.  Notice that case is ignored when searching for the word in the subject lines.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>n</strong><em>word</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Same as the <strong>s</strong> form except that it searched for articles where the sender <em>name</em> matches <em>word</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>e</strong><em>word</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Same as the <strong>s</strong> form except that it Psearched for articles where <em>either</em> the subject or the sender name matches <em>word</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>word</em> = <strong>/</strong><em>regexp</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When the first character of the <em>word</em> specified with the <strong>s</strong>, <strong>n</strong>, and <strong>e</strong> forms is a slash `/', the rest of the input is interpreted as a regular expression to search for.  Notice that regular expression matching is case insensitive when <strong>case-fold-search</strong> is set (default).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>return</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The meaning of an empty answer depends on the context: if there are unread articles in the specified group the unread articles will be presented, otherwise <em>all</em> articles in the group will be included in the menu.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>If you specified the current group, and the menu already contains all the available articles, <em>nn</em> will directly prompt for a word to search for in the subject of all articles (the prompt will be an equal sign.)</p><p>When the goto command creates a new menu level, <em>nn</em> will not perform auto kill or selection in the group.  You can use the <strong>+</strong> command in menu mode to perform the auto-selections.</p><p>There are three commands in the goto family:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>G</strong>	{<strong>goto-group</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is the general goto command described above.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>B</strong>	{<strong>back-group</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Backup one or more groups.  You can hit this key one or more times to go back in the groups already presented (including those without new articles); when you have found the group you are looking for, hit <strong>space</strong> to enter it.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>A</strong>	{<strong>advance-group</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Advance one or more groups.  This command is similar to the <strong>B</strong> command, but operates in the opposite direction.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>N</strong>	{<strong>next-group</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When used within an <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong> command, it skips forward to the next group in the sequence with unread articles or which has previously been visited.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>P</strong>	{<strong>previous</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When used within an <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong> command, it skips backwards to the preceding group in the sequence with unread articles or which has previously been visited.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Once you have entered an <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong>command, you can freely mix the <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>P</strong>, and <strong>N</strong> commands to find the group you want, and you can also use the <strong>G</strong> command to be prompted for a group name.</p><p>To show the use of the goto command some typical examples on its use are given below:</p>
<pre>
<em>Present the unread articles in the dk.general group</em>

 	<strong>G</strong> dk.general <strong>return</strong> <strong>u</strong>

<em>Jump directly to the gnu.emacs group and continue from there</em>

 	<strong>G</strong> gnu.emacs <strong>return</strong> <strong>j</strong>

<em>Include the last 10 READ articles in the current group menu</em>

 	<strong>G</strong> 10 <strong>return</strong>

<em>Find all articles in rec.music.misc on the subject Floyd</em>

 	<strong>G</strong> rec.music.misc <strong>return</strong>
 	<strong>=</strong> floyd <strong>return</strong>


<em>Open the folder +nn</em>

 	<strong>G</strong> +nn <strong>return</strong>

<em>Split current article as a digest (in reading mode)</em>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">AUTOMATIC KILL AND SELECTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>When there is a subject or an author which you are either very interested in, or find completely uninteresting, you can easily instruct <em>nn</em> to <em>auto-select</em> or <em>auto-kill</em> articles with specific subjects or from specific authors.  These instructions are stored in a <em>kill file</em>, and the most common types of entries can be created using the following command:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>K</strong>	{<strong>kill-select</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Create an entry in your personal kill file.  The contents of the entry is specified during a short dialog that is described in details below. This command is available in both selection and reading mode.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Entries in the kill file may apply to a single newsgroup or to all newsgroups.  Furthermore, entries may be permanent or they may be expired a given number of days after their entry.</p><p>To increase performance, <em>nn</em> uses a compiled version of the kill file which is read in when <em>nn</em> is invoked.  The compiled kill file will automatically be updated if the normal kill file has been modified.</p><p>The following dialog is used to build the kill file entry:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>AUTO (k)ill or (s)elect (CR =&gt; Kill subject 30 days)</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If you simply want <em>nn</em> to kill all articles with the subject of the current article (in reading mode) or a specific article (which <em>nn</em> will prompt for in selection mode), just hit <strong>return</strong>. This will cause <em>nn</em> to create an entry in the kill file to kill the current (or specified) subject in the current group for a period of 30 days (which should be enough for the discussion to die out).</p><p>You can control the default kill period, or change it into a "select" period via the <strong>default-kill-select</strong> variable.</p><p>If this "default behaviour" is not what you want, just answer either <em>k</em> or <em>s</em> to kill or select articles, respectively, which will bring you on to the rest of the questions.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>AUTO SELECT on (s)ubject or (n)ame  (s)</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(The <em>SELECT</em> will be substituted with <em>KILL</em> depending on the previous answer).  Here you specify whether you want the kill or select to depend on the subject of the article (<strong>s</strong> or <strong>space</strong>), or on the name of the author (<strong>n</strong>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>SELECT NAME:</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(Again <em>SELECT</em> may be substituted with <em>KILL</em> and <em>SUBJECT</em> may replace <em>NAME</em>).  You must now enter a name (or subject) to select (or kill).  In reading mode, you may just hit <strong>return</strong> (or <strong>%</strong>) to use the name (or subject) of the current article.  In selection mode, you can use the name (or subject) from an article on the menu by answering with <strong>%</strong> followed by the corresponding article identifier.</p><p>When the name or subject is taken from an article (the current or one from the menu), <em>nn</em> will only select or kill articles where the name or subject matches the original name or subject exactly including case.</p><p>If the first character typed at the prompt is a slash `/', the rest of the line is used as a <em>regular expression</em> which is used to match the name or subject (case <em>in</em>sensitive).</p><p>Otherwise, <em>nn</em> will select or kill articles which <em>contain</em> the specified string anywhere in the name or subject (ignoring case).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>SELECT in (g)roup `dk.general' or in (a)ll groups  (g)</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You must now specify whether the selection or kill should apply to the current group only (<strong>g</strong> or <strong>space</strong>) or to all groups (<strong>a</strong>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>Lifetime of entry in days (p)ermanent  (30)</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You can now specify the lifetime of the entry, either by entering a number specifying the number of days the entry should be active, or <strong>p</strong> to specify the entry as a permanent entry.  An empty reply is equivalent to 30 days.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>CONFIRM SELECT ....</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Finally, you will be asked to confirm the entry, and you should especially note the presence or absence of the word <strong>exact</strong> which specify whether an exact match applies for the entry.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">THE FORMAT OF THE KILL FILE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The kill file consists of one line for each entry.  Empty lines and lines starting with a # character are ignored.  <em>nn</em> automatically places a # character in the first position of expired entries when it compiles the kill file.  You can then edit the kill file manually from time to time to clean out these entries.</p><p>Each line has the following format</p>
<pre>
	[<em>expire time</em> :] [<em>group name</em>] : <em>flags</em> : <em>string</em> [: <em>string</em>]...
</pre>
<p>Permanent entries have no <em>expire time</em> (in which case the colon is omitted as well!).  Otherwise, the <em>expire time</em> defines the time (as a time_t value) when the entry should be expired.</p><p>The <em>group name</em> field can have three forms:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>news.group.name</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If it is the name of a single news group (e.g. comp.unix), the entry applies to that group only.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>/</strong><em>regular expression</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If it starts with a slash `/' followed by a <em>regular expression</em> (e.g. /^news&#92;..*), the entry applies to all groups whose name are matched by the regular expression.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>empty</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>An empty group field will apply the entry to <em>all</em> groups.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The <em>flags</em> field consists of a list of characters which identifies the type of entry, and the interpretation of each <em>string</em> field.  When used, the flag characters must be used in the order in which they are described below:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>~</strong>	(optional)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When this flag is present on any of the entries for a specific group, it causes all entires which <em>are not auto-selected</em> to be killed. This is a simple way to say: I'm interested in this and that, but nothing else.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>+</strong>	or <strong>!</strong> (optional)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify an auto-select <strong>+</strong> or an auto-kill <strong>!</strong> entry, respectively.  If neither are used, the article is neither selected nor killed which is useful in combination with the `<strong>~</strong>' flag.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>&gt;</strong> (optional)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When used with a subject (flag <strong>s</strong>), the kill entry only matches follow-ups to that subject (i.e. where the Subject: line starts with Re:).  For example, to kill all "Re:"'s in rec.humor use the following kill entry: rec.humor:!&gt;s/:.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>&lt;</strong> (optional)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When used with a subject (flag <strong>s</strong>), the kill entry only matches base articles with that subject (i.e. where the Subject: line does not start with Re:).  For example, to kill all articles asking for help (but not follow-ups) in the tex group, add this to your kill file:</p>
<pre>
	comp.text.tex:!s&lt;/:^HELP
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>n</strong> or <strong>s</strong> or <strong>a</strong> (mandatory)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify whether the corresponding string applies to the name <strong>n</strong> or to the subject <strong>s</strong> of an article.  If flag <strong>a</strong> is used, the corresponding string is ignored (but must be present), and the entry applies to articles with a non-empty References: line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>/</strong> (optional)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies that the corresponding <em>string</em> is a <strong>regular expression</strong> which the sender or subject is matched against.  If not specified, a simple string match is performed using the given <em>string</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>=</strong> (optional)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies that the match against the name or subject is <em>case</em> sensitive.  Furthermore, when regular expression matching is <em>not</em> used, the name or subject must be of the same length of the <em>string</em> to match. Otherwise, the match will be case insensitive, and a <em>string</em> may occur anywhere in the name or subject to match.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>|</strong> or <strong>&</strong> (mandatory if multiple strings)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If more than one string is specified, the set of <em>flags</em> corresponding to each <em>string</em> must be separated by either an <em>or operator</em> `<strong>|</strong>' or an <em>and operator</em> `<strong>&</strong>'.  The and operator has a higher precedence than the or operator, e.g.  a complex match expression <em>a|b&c|d</em> will succeed if either of <em>a</em>, <em>b&c</em>, or <em>d</em> matches.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The <em>string</em> field in the entry is the name, subject or regular expression that will be matched against the name or subject of each article in the group (or all groups).  Colons and backslashes must be escaped with a backslash in the string.</p><p>Example 1:  Auto-select articles from `Tom Collins' (exact) on subject `News' in all groups:</p>
<pre>
    :+n=&s:Tom Collins:News
</pre>
<p>Example 2:  Kill all articles which are neither from `Tom' or `Eve' in some.group.  Select only articles from Eve:</p>
<pre>
    some.group:~n:Tom
</pre>

<pre>
    some.group:+n:Eve
</pre>
<p>The second example can also be written as a single entry with an or operator (in this case, the select/kill attribute only applies to the succeeding strings):</p>
<pre>
    some.group:~n|+n:Tom:Eve
</pre>
<p>To remove expired entries, to "undo" a <strong>K</strong> command, and to make the more advanced entries with more than one string, you will have to edit the kill file manually.  To recompile the file, you can use the <strong>:compile</strong> command.  When you invoke <em>nn</em>, it will also recompile the kill file if the compiled version is out of date.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <strong>!</strong> commands available in selection and reading mode are identical in operation (with one exception).  When you enter the shell escape command, you will be prompted for a shell command.  This command will be fed to the shell specified in the <strong>shell</strong> variable (default loaded from the SHELL environment variable or /bin/sh) after the following substitutions have been performed on the command:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Below are more useful commands which are available in both selection and reading modes.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>U</strong>	{<strong>unsub</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Unsubscribe to the current group.  You will not see this group any more unless you explicitly request it.  If the variable <strong>unsubscribe-mark-read</strong> is set, all articles in the group will be marked read when you unsubscribe.</p>
<pre>
  If the variable <strong>keep-unsubscribed</strong> is not set, the group will
</pre>
<p>be removed from .newsrc.  If you are not subscribing to the group, you will be given the possibility to <em>resubscribe</em> to the group!  This may be used in connection with the <strong>G</strong> command to resubscribe a group.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>C</strong>	{<strong>cancel</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Cancel (delete) an article in the current group or folder.  Cancelling articles in a folder will cause the folder to be rewritten when it is closed.  In selection mode, you will be prompted for the identifier of the article to cancel.  Normal users can only cancel their own articles. See also the section on folder maintenance.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Y</strong>	{<strong>overview</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Provide an overview of the groups with unread articles.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>"</strong>	{<strong>layout</strong>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change menu layout in selection mode.  The menu will be redrawn using the next layout (cycling through ..., 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, ...)</p>
  </dd>

<p>Most of the commands in <em>nn</em> are bound to a key and can be activated by a single keystroke.  However, there are a few commands that cannot be bound to a key directly.</p><p>As shown in the keystroke command descriptions, all commands have a name, and it is possible to activate a command by name with the <em>extended command</em> key (<strong>:</strong>).  Hitting this key will prompt you for the name of a command (and parameters).  For example, an alternative to hitting the <strong>R</strong> key to reply to an article is to enter the extended command <strong>:reply</strong> followed by <strong>return</strong>.  The <strong>:post</strong> and <strong>:unshar</strong> commands described earlier can also be bound to a key.  The complete list of commands which can be bound to keys is provided in the section on Key Mappings below.</p><p>The following extended commands <em>cannot</em> be bound to a key, mainly because they require additional parameters on the prompt line, or because it should not be possible to activate them too easily.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Has no effect besides redrawing the screen if necessary.  If an extended command (one which is prefixed by a :) produces any output requirering the screen to be redrawn, the screen will not be redrawn immediately if the variable <strong>delay-redraw</strong> is set (useful on slow terminals).  Instead another <strong>:</strong> prompt is shown to allow you to enter a new extended command immediately.  It is sufficient to hit <strong>return</strong> to redraw the screen, but it has been my experience that entering <strong>q return</strong> in this situation happens quite often, so it was made a no-op.</p>

    <p><strong>:rmail</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Open your mailbox (see the <strong>mail</strong> variable) as a folder to read the incoming messages.  This is <em>not</em> a full mail interface (depending on the nn configuration, you may not be able to delete messages, add cc: on replies, etc), but it can give you a quick glance at new mail without leaving <em>nn</em>.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">VARIABLES AND OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>It is possible to control the behaviour of <em>nn</em> through the setting (and unsetting) of the variables described below.  There are several ways of setting variables:</p><p>- Through command line options when <em>nn</em> is invoked.</p><p>- Through <em>assignments</em> on the command line when <em>nn</em> is invoked.</p><p>- Through global <strong>set</strong> commands in the init file.</p><p>- Through <strong>set</strong> or <strong>local</strong> commands executed from entry macros.</p><p>- Through the <strong>:set</strong> extended command when you run <em>nn</em>.</p><p>There are four types of variables:</p><p>- Boolean variables</p><p>- Integer variables</p><p>- String variables</p><p>- Key variables</p><p>Boolean variables control a specific function in <em>nn</em>, e.g. whether the current time is shown in the prompt line.  A boolean variable is set to <strong>true</strong> with the command</p>
<pre>
	<strong>set</strong> <em>variable</em>
</pre>
<p>and it is set to <strong>false</strong> with either of the following (equivalent) commands:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>unset</strong> <em>variable</em>
	<strong>set no</strong><em>variable</em>
</pre>
<p>You can also toggle the value of a boolean variable using the command:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>toggle</strong> <em>variable</em>
</pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>set</strong> time
	<strong>unset</strong> time
	<strong>set</strong> notime
	<strong>toggle</strong> time
</pre>
<p>Integer variables control an amount e.g. the size of the preview window, or the maximum number of articles to read in each group.  They are set with the following command:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>set</strong> <em>variable value</em>
</pre>
<p>In some cases, not setting an integer value has a special meaning, for example, not having a minimal preview window or reading all articles in the groups no matter how many there are.  The special meaning can be re-established by the following command:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>unset</strong> <em>variable</em>
</pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>set</strong> window 7
	<strong>unset</strong> limit
</pre>
<p>String variables may specify directory names, default values for prompts, etc.  They are set using the command</p>
<pre>
	<strong>set</strong> <em>variable string</em>
</pre>
<p>Normally, the <em>string</em> value assigned to the <em>variable</em> value starts at the first non-blank character after the variable name and ends with the last non-blank character (excluding comments) on the line.  To include leading or trailing blanks, or the comment start symbol, #, in the string they must be escaped using a backslash `&#92;', e.g. to set <strong>included-mark</strong> to the string " # ", the following assignment can be used:</p>
<pre>
	set included-mark  &#92;&nbsp;&#92;#&#92;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# blank-#-blank
</pre>
<p>To include a backslash in the string, it must be duplicated `&#92;&#92;'. A backslash may also be used to include the following special characters in the string: &#92;a=alarm, &#92;b=backspace, &#92;e=escape, &#92;f=form-feed, &#92;n=new-line, &#92;r=return, &#92;t=tab.</p><p>Key variables control the keys used to control special functions during user input such as line editing and completion.  They are set using the command</p>
<pre>
	<strong>set</strong> <em>variable key-name</em>
</pre>
<p>A variable can be <em>locked</em> which makes further modification of the variable impossible:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>lock</strong> <em>variable</em>
</pre>
<p>This can be used in the <em>setup</em> init file which is loaded unconditionally to enforce local conventions or restrictions.  For example, to fix the <strong>included-mark</strong> variable to the string "&gt;", the following commands can be placed in the setup file:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>set</strong> included-mark &gt;
	<strong>lock</strong> included-mark
</pre>
<p>Some variables only make sense when set on the command line, since they are examined early in startup, before the init files are read. The syntax for setting variables on the command line is: <strong>variable</strong>=<em>value</em> The value may need to be quoted if it contains white space or special characters. They can be intermixed with other options, and are examined prior to other argument parsing.</p><p>The current variable settings can be shown with the <strong>:set</strong> command:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>:set</strong> (without arguments)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This will give a listing of the variables which have been set in either the init file or interactively.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>:set all</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This will give a listing of all variables.  Modified variables will be marked with a `*' and <em>local</em> variables will be marked with a `&gt;'. A locked variable is marked with a `!'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>:set /</strong><em>regexp</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This will give a listing of all variables whose name matches the given regular expression.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>:set</strong> <em>partial-name</em> <strong>space</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <strong>space</strong> (<strong>comp1-key</strong>) key will complete the variable name as usual, but as a side effect it will display the variable's current value in the message line.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Variables are global by default, but a local instantiation of the variable can be created using the <strong>:local</strong> command.  The local variable will overlay the global variable as long as the current group is active, i.e. the global variable will be used again when you exit the current group.  The initial value of the local variable will be the same as the global variable, unless a new value is specified in the <strong>:local</strong> command:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>:local</strong> <em>variable</em> [ <em>value</em> ]
</pre>
<p>The following variables are available:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>also-full-digest</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When a digest is split, the digest itself is not normally included on the menu, and as such the initial adminstrative information is not available.  Setting <strong>also-full-digest</strong> will cause the (unsplit) digest to be included on the menu.  These articles are marked with a @ at the beginning of the subject.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>also-subgroups</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, a group name in the presentation sequence will also cause all the subgroups of the group to be included, for example, comp.unix will also include comp.unix.questions, etc.  When <strong>also-subgroups</strong> is not set, subgroups are only included if the group name is followed by a `.' in which case the main group is <em>not</em> included, i.e. `comp.unix' is not included when `comp.unix.' is specified in the presentation sequence, and vice-versa.  Following a group name by an asterisk `*', e.g. comp.unix*, will include the group as well as all subgroups independently of the setting of <strong>also-subgroups</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>append-signature-mail</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When false, it is assumed that the .signature file is automatically appended to responses sent via E-mail.  If true, .signature will be appended to the letter (see query-signature).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>append-signature-post</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When false, it is assumed that the .signature file is automatically appended to posted articles.  If true, .signature will explicitly be appended to posted articles (see query-signature).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>attributes</strong> <em>symbols</em>	(string, default ....)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Each element in this string represents a symbol used to represent an article attribute when displayed on the screen.  See the section on Marking Articles and Attributes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>auto-junk-seen</strong><em>	(boolean, default true)</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, articles which have the <em>seen attribute</em> (,) will be marked read when the current group is left.  If not set, these articles will still be either unread or marked seen the next time the group is entered (see also <strong>confirm-junk-seen</strong> and <strong>retain-seen-status</strong><em>).</em></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>auto-preview-mode</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enables <em>Auto Preview Mode</em>.  In this mode, selecting an article on the menu using its article id (letter a-z) will enter preview mode on that article immediately.  Furthermore, the `n' {<strong>next-article</strong>} command will preview the next article on the menu only if it has the same subject as the current article; otherwise, it will return to the menu with the cursor placed on the next article.  The <strong>continue</strong> command at the end of the article and the `=' {<strong>goto-menu</strong>} returns to the menu immediately as usual.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>auto-read-mode-limit</strong> <em>N</em>	(integer, default 0)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When operating in <em>auto reading mode</em>, <em>nn</em> will <em>auto-select</em> all unread articles in the group, skip the article selection phase, and enter reading mode directly after entry to the group.</p>
<pre>
  Auto reading mode is disabled when <strong>auto-read-mode-limit</strong> is
</pre>
<p>zero; it is activated unconditionally if the value is negative, and conditionally if the value is greater than zero and the number of unread articles in the current group does not exceed the given value.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally, selecting a <em>closed subject</em> (usually in consolidated menu mode) will select (or deselect) all <em>unread</em> articles with the given subject (or all articles if they are all read).  This behaviour can be changed via the value of this variable as follows:</p>
<pre>
0: select only the first article with the subject (shown on menu).
1: select only the unread articles with the subject.
2: select all available articles with the subject.
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>auto-select-rw</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set, a subject of an article read or posted is automatically used for subsequent auto-selecting (if not already selected). This is the most efficient way to see your own posts automatically.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>auto-select-subject</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, selecting an article from the menu using the article id (a-z), all articles on the menu with the same subject will automatically be selected as well.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>backup</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, a copy of the initial .newsrc and select files will save be the first time they are changed.  <em>nn</em> remembers the initial contents of these files internally, so the backup variable can be set any time if not set on start-up.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>backup-folder-path</strong> <em>file</em>	(string, default "BackupFolder~")</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When removing deleted articles from a folder, this variable defines the name of the file where a (temporary) copy of the original folder is saved.  If the <em>file</em> name doesn't contain a `/', the file will be located in the .nn directory.  Otherwise the file name is used directly as the relative or full path name of the backup file. If possible, the old folder will be renamed to the backup folder name; otherwise the old folder is copied to the backup folder.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>backup-suffix</strong> <em>suffix</em>	(string, default ".bak")</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The suffix appended to file names to make the corresponding backup file name (see <strong>backup</strong>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bug-report-address</strong> <em>address</em>	(string, default mtpins@nndev.org)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The mail address to which bug reports created with the <strong>:bug</strong> command are sent.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>case-fold-search</strong>		(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, string and regular expression matching will be case independent.  This is related to all commands matching on names or subjects, except in connection with auto-kill and auto-select where the individual kill file entries specifies this property.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>charset</strong> <em>charset</em>	(string, default "us-ascii")</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The character set in use on your terminal. Legal values are "us-ascii", "iso-8859-<em>X</em>", where <em>X</em> is a nonzero digit, and "unknown". Setting this variable also sets the <strong>data-bits</strong> variable to the default bit width of the character set (7 for "us-ascii" and "unknown", 8 for the "iso-8859-<em>X</em>" sets).</p><p>The value of this variable also determines wether <em>nn</em> allows 8-bit characters in the body of articles being posted and letters being mailed (unless the value is "unknown", in which case this is determined by the value of the <strong>data-bits</strong> variable). If necessary, <em>nn</em> will add extra headers to the message indicating its the character set.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>check-group-access</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will perform a check on the readability of a group's readability before showing the menu for that group.  Normally, this is not necessary since all users traditionally have access to all news groups.  Setting (and locking) this variable may be used to limit access to a news group via the permissions and ownership of the group's spool directory (this will only work for non-NNTP sites).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>collapse-subject</strong> <em>offset</em>	(integer, default 25)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set (non-negative), subject lines which are too long to be presented in full on the menus will be "collapsed" by removing a sufficient number of characters from the subject starting at the given <em>offset</em> in the subject.  This is useful in source groups where the "Part (01/10)" string sometimes disappears from the menu.  When not set (or negative), the subjects are truncated.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>columns</strong> <em>col</em>	(integer, default screen width)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This variable contains the screen width i.e. character positions per line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>comp1-key</strong> <em>key</em>	(key, default <strong>space</strong>)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The key which gives the first/next completion, and the default value when <em>nn</em> is prompting for a string, e.g. a file name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>comp2-key</strong> <em>key</em>	(key, default <strong>tab</strong>)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The key which ends the current completion and gives the first completion for the next component when <em>nn</em> is prompting for a string, e.g. a file name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>compress</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This variable controls whether text compression (see the <strong>compress</strong> command) is turned on or off when an article is shown.  The compression is still toggled for the current article with the <strong>compress</strong> command key.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>confirm-append</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will ask for confirmation before appending an article to an existing file (see also <strong>confirm-create</strong>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>confirm-auto-quit</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will ask for confirmation before quitting after having read the last group.  If not confirmed, <em>nn</em> will recycle the presentation sequence looking for groups that were skipped with the `N' {<strong>next-group</strong>} command.  But it will not look for new articles arrived since the invocation of <em>nn</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>confirm-create</strong>		(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will ask for confirmation before creating a new file or directory when saving or unpacking an article (see also <strong>confirm-append</strong>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>confirm-entry</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will ask for confirmation before entering a group with more than <strong>confirm-entry-limit</strong> unread articles (on the first menu level).  It is useful on slow terminals if you don't want to wait until <em>nn</em> has drawn the first menu to be able to skip the group.</p>
<pre>
  Answering no to the "Enter?" prompt will cause <em>nn</em> to skip to
</pre>
<p>the next group without marking the current group as read.  If you answer by hitting <strong>interrupt</strong>, <em>nn</em> will ask the question "Mark as read?" which allows you to mark the current group as read before going to the next group.  If this second question is also answered by hitting <strong>interrupt</strong>, <em>nn</em> will quit immediately.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>confirm-entry-limit</strong> <em>articles</em>	(integer, default 0)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies the minimum number of unread articles in a group for which the <strong>confirm-entry</strong> functionality is activated.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>confirm-junk-seen</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will require confirmation before marking seen articles as read when <strong>auto-junk-seen</strong> is set.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>confirm-messages</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>In some cases, <em>nn</em> will sleep one second (or more) when it has shown a message to the user, e.g. in connection with macro debugging.  Setting <strong>confirm-messages</strong> will cause <em>nn</em> to <em>wait</em> for you to confirm all messages by hitting any key.  (It will show the symbol &lt;&gt; to indicate that it is awaiting confirmation.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>consolidated-manual</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, the <em>online manual</em> will be presented with one menu line for each <em>program</em> in the <em>nn</em> package.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>consolidated-menu</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will automatically <em>close</em> all multi-article subjects on entry to a group, so that each subject only occur once on the menu page.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>counter-delim-left</strong>	(string, default "[")</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The delimiter string output to the left of the article counter in a closed subject's menu line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>counter-delim-right</strong>	(string, default "] ")</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The delimiter string output to the right of the article counter in a closed subject's menu line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>counter-padding</strong> <em>pad</em>		(integer, default 5)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>On a consolidated menu, the subjects may not be very well aligned because the added [...] counters have varying length.  To (partially) remedy this, all counters (and subjects without counters) are prefixed by up to <em>pad</em> spaces to get better alignment.  Increasing it further may yield practially perfect alignment at the cost of less space for the subject itself.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>cross-filter-seq</strong>		(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, cross posted articles will be presented in the first possible group, i.e. according to the current presentation sequence (<em>cross</em>-post <em>filter</em>ing on <em>seq</em>uence).  The article is automatically marked read in the other cross posted groups unless you unsubscribe to the first group in which it was shown before reading the other groups.  Likewise, it is sufficient to leave the article unread in the first group to keep it for later handling.</p>
<pre>
  If not set, cross-postings are shown in the first group occurring on
</pre>
<p>the Newsgroups: line which the user subscribes to (i.e. you let the poster decide which group is most appropriate to read his posting).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>cross-post</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally, <em>nn</em> will only show cross-posted articles in the first subscribed group on the Newsgroups: line.  When <strong>cross-post</strong> is set, <em>nn</em> will show cross-posted articles in all subscribed groups to which they are posted.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>cross-post-limit</strong> <em>N</em>        (integer, default 0)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this variable is set to a value other than 0, then any articles posted to more than <em>N</em> newsgroups are automatically skipped. A value of 5 is pretty good for discarding ``spam'' articles.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>data-bits</strong> <em>bits</em>	(integer, default 7)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set to 7, <em>nn</em> will display characters with the 8th bit set using a meta-notation <strong>M-</strong><em>7bit-char</em>.  If set to 8, these characters are sent directly to the screen (unless <strong>monitor</strong> is set). Setting the <strong>charset</strong> variable also sets this variable to the default bit width of character set.</p><p>It also controls whether keyboard input is 7 or 8 bits, and thus whether key maps contain 127 or 255 entries.  See the key mapping section for more details.</p><p>If the <strong>charset</strong> has value "unknown", the value of <strong>data-bits</strong> also determines wether <em>nn</em> allows 8-bit characters in the body of articles being posted and letters being mailed (this is normally determined directly by the <strong>charset</strong> variable).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>date</strong>		(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set <em>nn</em> will show the article posting date when articles are read.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>debug</strong> <em>mask</em>	(integer, default 0)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Look in the source if you are going to use this.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>decode-header-file</strong> <em>file</em>	(string, default "Decode.Headers")</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The name of the file in which the header and initial text of articles decoded with the <strong>:decode</strong> command is saved.  Unless the file name starts with a `/', the file will be created in the same directory as the decoded files.  The information is not saved if this variable is not set.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>decode-skip-prefix</strong> <em>N</em>	(integer, default 2)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When non-null, the <strong>:decode</strong> command will automatically skip <em>upto</em> <em>N</em> characters at the beginning of each line to find valid uuencoded data.  This allows <em>nn</em> to automatically decode (multi-part) postings which are both uuencoded and packed with shar.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>default-distribution</strong> <em>distr</em>	(string, default "world")</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The distribution to use as the default suggestion when posting articles using the <strong>follow</strong> and <strong>post</strong> commands if the corresponding <strong>follow-distribution</strong> or <strong>post-distribution</strong> variable contains the <strong>default</strong> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>default-kill-select</strong> <em>[1]days</em>	(number, default 30)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies the default action for the <strong>K</strong> {<strong>kill-select</strong>} command if the first prompt is answered by <strong>return</strong>.  It contains the number of days to keep the kill or select entry in the kill file (1-99 days).  If it has the value <em>days</em>+100 (e.g. 130), it denotes that the default action is to <em>select</em> rather than kill on the subject for the specified period.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>default-save-file</strong> <em>file</em>	(string, default +$F)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The default save file used when saving articles in news groups where no save file has been specified in the init file (either in a <strong>save-files</strong> section or in the presentation sequence). It can also be specified using the abbreviation "+" as the file name when prompted for a file name even in groups with their own save file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>delay-redraw</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally, <em>nn</em> will redraw the screen after extended commands (:cmd) that clear the screen.  When <strong>delay-redraw</strong> is set <em>nn</em> will prompt for another extended command instead of redrawing the screen (hit <strong>return</strong> to redraw).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>echo-prefix-key</strong>		(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When true, hitting a prefix key (see the section on key mapping below) will cause the prefix key to be echoed in the message line to indicate that another key is expected.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>edit-patch-command</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When true, the <strong>:patch</strong> command will show the current <strong>patch-command</strong> and give you a chance to edit it before applying it to the articles.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>edit-print-command</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When true, the <strong>print</strong> command will show the current <strong>printer</strong> command and give you a chance to edit it before printing the articles. Otherwise the articles are just printed using the current <strong>printer</strong> command.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>edit-response-check</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When editing a response to an article, it normally does not have any meaning to send the initial file prepared by <em>nn</em> unaltered, since it is either empty or only contains included material.  When this variable is set, exiting the editor without having changed the file will automatically abort the response action without confirmation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>edit-unshar-command</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When true, the <strong>:unshar</strong> command will show the current <strong>unshar-command</strong> and give you a chance to edit it before applying it to the articles.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>editor</strong> <em>command</em>	(string, default not set)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, it will override the current EDITOR environment variable when editing responses and new articles.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>embedded-header-escape</strong> <em>string</em>	(string, default '~')</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When saving an article to a file, header lines embedded in the body of the article are escaped using this string to make it possible for <em>nn</em> to split the folder correctly afterwards. Header lines are not escaped if this variable is not set.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>enter-last-read-mode</strong> <em>mode</em>	(integer, default 1)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally, <em>nn</em> will remember which group is active when you quit, and offer to jump directly to this group when you start <em>nn</em> the next time.  This variable is used to control this behaviour.  The following <em>mode</em> values are recognized:</p>
<pre>
0: Ignore the remembered group (r.g.).
1: Enter r.g. if the group is unread (with user confirmation)
2: Enter r.g. or first unread group after it in the sequence (w/conf).
3: Enter r.g. if the group is unread (no confirmation)
4: Enter r.g. or first unread group after it in the sequence (no conf).
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>entry-report-limit</strong> <em>articles</em>	(integer, default 300)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally, <em>nn</em> will just move the cursor to the upper left corner of the screen while it is reading articles from the database on entry to a group.  For large groups this may take more than a fraction of a second, and <em>nn</em> can then report what it is doing.  If it must read more articles than the number specified by this variable, <em>nn</em> will report which group and how many articles it is reading.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>erase-key</strong> <em>key</em>	(key, default tty erase key)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The key which erases the last input character when <em>nn</em> is prompting for a string, e.g. a file name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>expert</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set <em>nn</em> will use slightly shorter prompts (e.g. not tell you that ? will give you help), and be a bit less verbose in a few other cases (e.g. not remind you that posted articles are not available instantly).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>expired-message-delay</strong> <em>pause</em>	(integer, default 1)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If a selected article is found to have been expired, <em>nn</em> will normally give a message about this and sleep for a number of seconds specified by this variable.  Setting this variable to zero will still make <em>nn</em> give the message without sleeping afterwards.  Setting it to -1 will cause the message not to be shown at all.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>flow-control</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will turn on xon/xoff flow-control before writing large amounts of text to the screen.  This should guard against lossage of output, but in some network configurations it has had the opposite effect, losing several lines of the output.  This variable is always true on systems with CBREAK capabilities which can do single character reads without disabling flow control.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>flush-typeahead</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When true, <em>nn</em> will flush typeahead prior to reading commands from the keyboard.  It will not flush typeahead while reading parameters for a command, e.g. file names etc.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>folder</strong> <em>directory</em>	(string, default ~/News)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The full pathname of the <em>folder directory</em> which will replace the + in folder names.  It will be initialized from the FOLDER environment variable if it is not set in the <em>init</em> file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>folder-format-check</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When saving an article with a full or partial header in an existing folder, <em>nn</em> will check the format of the folder to be able to append the article in the proper format.  If this variable is not set, folders are assumed to be in the format specified via the <strong>mmdf-format</strong> and <strong>mail-format</strong> variables, and articles are saved in that format without checking.  Otherwise, the <strong>*-format</strong> variables are only used to determine the format for <em>new</em> folders.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>folder-save-file</strong> <em>file</em>	(string, default not set)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The default save file used when saving articles <em>from</em> a folder.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>follow-distribution</strong> <em>words</em>	(string, default see below)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This variable controls how the Distribution: header is constructed for a follow-up to an original article.  Its value is a list of <em>words</em> selected from the following list:</p><p>[ [ <strong>always</strong> ] <strong>same</strong> ] [ <strong>ask</strong> ] [ <strong>default</strong> | <em>distribution</em> ]</p><p>This is interpreted in two steps:</p><p>- First the default distribution is determined.  If <strong>same</strong> is specified and the original article has a Distribution: header, that header is used.  Else if <strong>default</strong> is specified (or <em>distribution</em> is omitted), the value of <strong>default-distribution</strong> is used.  And finally, if only a <em>distribution</em> (any word) is specified that is used as the default.</p><p>- Then if <strong>ask</strong> is specified, the user will be asked to confirm the default distribution or provide another distribution.  However, if <strong>always</strong> (and <strong>same</strong>) is specified, and the default was taken from the original article's distribution, the original distribution is used <em>without</em> confirmation.</p><p>The default value of <strong>follow-distribution</strong> is <strong>always</strong> <strong>same</strong> <strong>default</strong>, i.e. use either the original distribution or the <strong>default-distribution</strong> without confirmation in either case.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>from-line-parsing</strong> <em>strictness</em>	(integer, default 2)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies how strict <em>nn</em> must parse a "From " line in a folder to recognize it as a mail format message separator line.  The following strictness values determine whether a line starting with "From " will be recognized as a separator line:</p>
<pre>
	0: Always.
	1: Line must have at least 8 fields.
	2: Line must contain a valid date and time (ctime style).
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>fsort</strong>		(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, folders are sorted alphabetically according to the subject (and age). Otherwise, the articles in a folder will be presented in the sequence in which they were saved.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>guard-double-slash</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally, when entering a file name, entering two slashes `//' in a row (or following a slash by a plus `/+') will cause <em>nn</em> to erase the entire line and replace it with the `/' (or `+').  On some systems, two slashes are used in network file names, and on those systems <strong>guard-double-slash</strong> can be set; that will cause <em>nn</em> to require <em>three</em> slashes in a row to clear the input.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>header-lines</strong> <em>list</em>	(string, no default)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, it determines the list of header fields that are shown when an article is read instead of the normal one line header showing the author and subject.  See the full description in the section on Customized Article Headers below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>help-key</strong> <em>key</em>	(key, default <strong>?</strong>)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The key which ends the current completion and gives a list of possible completions for the next component when <em>nn</em> is prompting for a string, e.g. a file name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ignore-re</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set, articles with subjects already seen in a previous invocation of nn or another newsreader - and not auto-selected - are automatically killed.  A great way to read even less news!</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ignore-xon-xoff</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally, <em>nn</em> will ignore ^S and ^Q in the input from the terminal (if they are not handled in the tty driver).  Setting this variable will treat these characters as normal input.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>include-art-id</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The first line in a response with included material normally reads "...somebody... writes:" without a reference to the specific article from which the quotation was taken (this is found in the References: line).

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>Limit</em> the maximum number of articles presented in each group to <em>max-articles.</em> The default is to present <em>all</em> unread articles no matter how many there are.  Setting this variable, only the most recent <em>max-articles</em> articles will be presented, but all the articles will still be marked as read.

    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will <em>shade</em> overlapping lines (see the <strong>overlap</strong> variable) using the attributes defined by the <strong>shading-on</strong> and <strong>shading-off</strong> variables (of if not set, with the underline attribute).  This is typically used to give overlapping lines a different colour on terminals which have this capability.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>menu-spacing</strong> <em>mode</em>	(integer, default 0)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When <em>mode</em> is a non-zero number as described below, <em>nn</em> will add blank lines between the lines on the menu to increase readability at the cost of presenting fewer articles on each page.  The following values of <em>mode</em> are recognized:</p>
<pre>

    <p>When the <strong>window</strong> variable is not set, <em>nn</em> will clear the screen to preview an article if there are less than <em>size</em> unused lines at the bottom of the menu screen.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>mmdf-format</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will save articles in MMDF format. Unless <strong>folder-format-check</strong> is false, it is only used to specify the format used when new folders are created.</p>
  </dd>

    <p><strong>monitor</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will show <em>all</em> characters in the received messages using a "cat -v" like format. Otherwise, only the printable characters are shown (default).</p>

    <p><strong>multi-key-guard-time</strong> <em>timeout</em>	(integer, default 2)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When reading a multi-key sequence from the keyboard, <em>nn</em> will expect the characters constituting the multi-key to arrive "quickly" after each other.  When a partial multi-key sequence is read, <em>nn</em> will wait (at least) <em>timeout</em> tenths of a second for each of the following characters to arrive to complete the multi-key sequence.  If the multi-key sequence is <em>not</em> completed within this period, <em>nn</em> will read the partial multi-key sequence as individual characters instead.  This way it is still possible to use for example the ESC key on a terminal with vt100 like arrow keys. When <em>nn</em> is used via an rlogin connection, you may have to increase the timeout to get reliable recognition of multi-keys.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>new-group-action</strong> <em>action</em>	(integer, default 3)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This variable controls how new groups are treated by <em>nn</em>.  It is an integer variable, and the following values can be used.  Some of these actions (marked with an *) will only work when <strong>keep-unsubscribed</strong> is set, since the presence of a group in .newsrc is the only way to recognize it as an old group:</p><p><strong>0</strong>)  Ignore groups which are not in .newsrc.  This will obviously include new groups, and therefore you must explicitly add any new groups that you care about (by editing the <em>.newsrc</em> file, or using the <strong>G</strong> menu command and then subscribing to the group). When <strong>NNTP</strong> is being used, this setting prevents the <em>active.times</em> data from being read from the server; this can be helpful when using a slow link, since the data can often be hundreds of KBytes long.</p><p><strong>1</strong>*)  Groups not in .newsrc are considered to be new, and are inserted at the beginning of the .newsrc file.</p><p><strong>2</strong>*)  Groups not in .newsrc are considered to be new, and are appended to the end of the .newsrc file.</p><p><strong>3</strong>)  New groups are recognized via a time-stamp saved in the file .nn/LAST and in the database, i.e. it is not dependent on the groups currently in .newsrc.  The new groups are automatically appended to .newsrc with subscription.  Old groups not present in .newsrc will be considered to be unsubscribed.</p><p><strong>4</strong>)  As <strong>3</strong>, but the user is asked to confirm that the new group should be appended to .newsrc.  If rejected, the group will not be appended to .newsrc, and thus be regarded as unsubscribed.</p><p><strong>5</strong>)  As <strong>4</strong>, except that the information is stored in a format compatible with the <em>rn</em> news reader (.rnlast).  This needs to be tested!</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>new-style-read-prompt</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>

    <p><strong>newsrc</strong> <em>file</em> (string, default "~/.newsrc") Specifies the</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>file used by <em>nn</em> to register which groups and articles have been read.  The default setting corresponds to the .newsrc file used by other news readers.  Notice that <em>nn</em> release 6.4 onwards <em>does allow</em> individual articles to be marked unread, and some articles marked unread, and thus no longer messes up .newsrc for other news readers!  Also see <em>nntp-server</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>nn-directory</strong> <em>directory</em>	(string, default "~/.nn")</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>It only makes sense to set this variable on the command line, e.g. "nn-directory=$HOME/.nn2" since it is looked at before the init file is read.  It must be set to a full pathname.  Usually set when using multiple servers; see <em>newsrc</em> above and <em>nntp-server</em> below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>nntp-cache-dir</strong> <em>directory</em>	(string, default "~/.nn")</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When NNTP is used, <em>nn</em> needs to store articles temporarily on disk.  This variable specifies which directory <em>nn</em> will use to hold these files.  The default value may be changed during configuration.  This variable can only be set in the init file.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>nntp-server</strong> <em>hostname</em> or <em>filename</em><em> (string)</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>It only makes sense to set this variable on the command line, e.g. "nntp-server=news.some.domain", since it is looked at before the init file, If you use multiple servers, you probably want to set the <em>nn-directory</em> and <em>newsrc</em> variables on the command line to alternate names as well, since some of the data files are server dependent.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>old</strong> [<em>max-articles</em>]	(integer, default not set)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When <strong>old</strong> is set, <em>nn</em> will present (or scan) all (or the last <em>max-articles</em>) unread as well as read articles.  While <strong>old</strong> is set, <em>nn</em> will <em>never</em> mark any unread articles as read.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>old-packname</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, nn display names identically to nn-6.6.5 (and earlier).  Only set this if you have a large number of entries in your killfile that no longer work due to the new behaviour.  Note that in the long run, this option will go away, so it's best to update your killfile rather than set this.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>orig-to-include-mask</strong> <em>N</em>	(integer, default 3)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When replying to an article, <em>nn</em> will include some of the header lines which may be used to construct a proper mail address for the poster of the original article.  These addresses are placed on <em>Orig-To:</em> lines in the reply header and will automatically be removed before the letter is sent.  This variable specifies which headers from the article are included; its value <em>N</em> is the sum of the following values:</p>
<pre>
	1: <em>Reply-To:</em>
	2: <em>From:</em>
	4: <em>Path:</em>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>post-distribution</strong> <em>words</em>	(string, default see below)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This variable controls how the Distribution: header is constructed when posting an original article.  Its value is a list of <em>words</em> selected from the following list:</p><p>[ <strong>ask</strong> ] [ <strong>default</strong> | <em>distribution</em> ]</p><p>This is interpreted in two steps:</p><p>- First the default distribution is determined.  If <strong>default</strong> is specified (or <em>distribution</em> is omitted), the value of <strong>default-distribution</strong> is used.  Otherwise, the specified <em>distribution</em> (any word) is used as the default.</p><p>- Then if <strong>ask</strong> is specified, the user will be asked to confirm the default distribution or provide another distribution.</p><p>The default value of <strong>post-distribution</strong> is <strong>ask</strong> <strong>default</strong>, i.e. use the <strong>default-distribution</strong> with confirmation from the user.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>preview-continuation</strong> <em>cond</em>	(integer, default 12)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This variable determines on what terms the following article should be automatically shown when previewing an article, and the <strong>next-article</strong> command is used, or <strong>continue</strong> is used at the end of the article.  The following values can be used:</p><p><strong>0</strong> - never show the next article (return to the menu).</p><p><strong>1</strong> - always show the next article (use 'q' to return to the menu).</p><p><strong>2</strong> - show the next article if it has the same subject as the current article, else return to the menu.</p><p>The value should be the <em>sum</em> of two values: one for the action after using <strong>continue</strong> on the last page of the article, and one for the action performed when the <strong>next-article</strong> command is used <em>multiplied by 10</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>preview-mark-read</strong>		(boolean, default true)</p>

    <p><strong>previous-also-read</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, going back to the previously read group with <strong>P</strong> {<strong>previous</strong>} will include articles read in the current invocation of <em>nn</em> even if there are still unread articles in the group.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>printer</strong> <em>shell-command</em>	(string, default is system dep.)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is the default value for the <strong>print</strong> command.  It should include an option which prevents the spooler from echoing a job-id or similar to the terminal to avoid problems with screen handling (e.g. lp -s on System V).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>query-signature</strong>		(boolean, default ...)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Will cause <em>nn</em> to require confirmation before appending the .signature file to out-going mail or news if the corresponding <strong>append-sig-</strong>... variable is set.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>quick-count</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, calculating the total number of unread articles at start-up is done by simple subtracting the first unread article number from the total number of articles in each group.  This is very fast, and fairly accurate but it may be a bit too large.  If not set, each line in .newsrc will be interpreted to count every unread article, thus giving a very accurate number.  This variable is also used by <em>nncheck</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>quick-save</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will not prompt for a file name when an article is saved (unless it belongs to a folder). Instead it uses the save file specified for the current group in the init file or the default save file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>re-layout</strong> <em>N</em>		(integer, default 0)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally on the menu, <em>nn</em> will prefix the subject a number of `&gt;'s corresponding to the number of references on the References: line.  The <strong>re-layout</strong> variable may be set to use a different prefix on the subjects:</p>
<pre>
	0:  One `&gt;' per reference is shown (default).
	1:  A single `&gt;' is shown if the Subject contains Re:.
	2:  The number of references is shown as `n&gt;'
	3:  A single Re: is shown.
	4:  If any references use layout 0, else layout 1.
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>re-layout-read</strong> <em>N</em>	(integer, default -1)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When the <strong>header-lines</strong> variable is not set, or contains the "*" field specifier, a line similar to the menu line will be used as the header of the article in reading mode, including the sender's name and the article's subject.  When this variable is negative, the subject on this header line will be prefixed according to the <strong>re-layout</strong> variable.  Otherwise, it will define the format of the "Re:" prefix to be used instead of the <strong>re-layout</strong> used on the menu.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>read-return-next-page</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, the <strong>Z</strong> {<strong>read-return</strong>} command will return to the <em>next</em> menu page rather than the current menu page.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>record</strong> <em>file</em>	(string, no default)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Setting this <em>pseudo</em> variable will set both the <strong>mail-record</strong> and the <strong>news-record</strong> variables to the specified pathname.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>repeat</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will not eliminate duplicated subject lines on menus (I cannot imagine why anyone should want that, but....)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>repeat-group-query</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, invoking <em>nn</em> with the <strong>-g</strong> option will always repeat the query for a group to enter until you quit explicitly. (Same as setting the <strong>-r</strong> option permanently).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>report-cost</strong>		(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This variable is ignored unless <em>nn</em> is running with accounting enabled (see <em>nnacct</em>).  When set, <em>nn</em> will report the cost of the current session and the total on exit.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>response-check-pause</strong> <em>pause</em>	(integer, default 2)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies the number of seconds to wait after posting an article to see whether the action *might* have failed.  Some commands run in the background and may thus not have completed during this period, so even when <em>nn</em> says "Article posted", it may still fail (in which case you are informed via mail).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>response-default-answer</strong> <em>action</em>	(string, default "send")</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The default action to be taken when hitting <strong>return</strong> to the "response action" prompt  (abort, edit, send, view, write).  If it is unset, no default action is defined.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>retain-seen-status</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally, seen articles will just be unread the next time the group is entered (unless they were marked read by <strong>auto-junk-seen</strong>).  If <strong>retain-seen-status</strong> is set, the seen attribute on the articles will survive to the next time the group is entered.  (This is not recommended because it may result in very large select files).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>retry-on-error</strong> <em>times</em>	(integer, default 0)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will try the specified number of <em>times</em> to open an article before reporting that the article does not exist any more.  This may be necessary in some network environments.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>save-closed-mode</strong> <em>mode</em>	(integer, default 13)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When saving an article in selection mode (i.e. by selecting it from the menu), <em>nn</em> will simply save the specified article if the article's subject is <em>open</em>.  When the selected menu entry is a closed subject, the <strong>save-closed-mode</strong> variable determines how many articles among the closed articles should be saved:</p>
<pre>
0: save root article (the one on the menu) only
1: save selected articles within subject
2: save unread (excl selected) articles within subject
3: save selected+unread articles within subject
4: save all articles within subject
</pre>
<p>If `10' is added to the above values, <em>nn</em> will not save the selected subject immediately; instead it will ask which articles to save using the above value as the default answer.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>save-counter</strong> <em>format</em>	(string, default "%d")</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is the printf-format which <em>nn</em> uses to create substitution string for the trailing * in save file names.  You can set this to more complex formats if you like, but be sure that it will produce different strings for different numbers.  An alternative format which seems to be popular is ".%02d" .</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>save-counter-offset</strong> <em>N</em>	(integer, default 0)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally, file names created with the <em>part.*</em> form will substitute the <em>*</em> with successive numbers starting from one. Setting this variable will cause these numbers to start from <em>N</em>+1.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>save-header-lines</strong> <em>fields</em>	(string, default "FDNS")</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies the list of header fields that are saved when an article is saved via the <strong>O</strong> {<strong>save-short</strong>} command. The <em>fields</em> specification is desctribed in the section on Customized Article Headers below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>save-report</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, a message reporting the number of lines written is shown after saving an article.  Since messages are shown for a few seconds, this may slow down the saving of many articles (e.g. using the <strong>S*</strong> command).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>scroll-clear-page</strong>		(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Determines whether <em>nn</em> clears the screen before showing each new page of an article.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>scroll-last-lines</strong> <em>N</em>		(integer, default 0)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally, <em>nn</em> will show each new page of an article from the top of the screen (with proper marking of the overlap).  When this variable is set to a negative value, <em>nn</em> will scroll the text of the new pages from the bottom of the screen instead.  If it is set to a positive value, <em>nn</em> will show pages from the top as usual, but switch to scrolling when there are <em>less than</em> the specified number of lines left in the article.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>select-leave-next</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, you will be asked whether to select articles with the <strong>leave-next</strong> attribute on entry to a group with left over articles.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>select-on-sender</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies whether the <strong>find</strong> (=) command in article selection mode will match on the subject or the sender.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>shading-on</strong> <em>code</em>...	(control string, default not set)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies the escape code to be sent to the terminal to cause "shading" of the following output to the screen.  This is used if the <strong>mark-overlap-shading</strong> is set, and by the `+' attribute in the <strong>header-lines</strong> variable.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>shading-off</strong> <em>code</em>...	(control string, default not set)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies the escape code to be sent to the terminal to turn off the shading defined by <strong>shading-on</strong>.  Shading will typically be done by changing the foreground colour to change, e.g.</p>
<pre>
	on term ti924-colour
		set shading-on  ^[ [ 3 2 m
		set shading-off ^[ [ 3 7 m
		set mark-overlap-shading
		unset mark-overlap
	end
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>shell</strong> <em>program</em>	(string, default $SHELL)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The shell program used to execute shell escapes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>shell-restrictions</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set (in the init file), <em>nn</em> will not allow the user to invoke the shell in any way, including saving on pipes.  It also prevents the user from changing certain variables containing commands.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>show-purpose-mode</strong> <em>N</em>		(integer, default 1)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally, <em>nn</em> will show the purpose of a group the first time it is read, provided a purpose is known.  Setting this variable, this behaviour can be changed as follows:</p>
<pre>
	0:  Never show the purpose.
	1:  Show the purpose for new groups only.
	2:  Show the purpose for all groups.
</pre>
<p>When <strong>NNTP</strong> is being used, a setting of 0 prevents the newsgroups purpose data from being read from the server; this can be helpful when using a slow link, since the data can often be hundreds of KBytes long.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>sign-type</strong>		(string, default pgp)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>What program nn will use to sign messages via the Sign command.  Only <em>pgp</em> and <em>gpg</em> are currently valid.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>silent</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> won't print the logo or "No News" if there are no unread articles.  Only useful to set in the init file or with the <strong>-Q</strong> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>slow-mode</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will cut down on the screen output to give better response time at low speed. Normally, <em>nn</em> will use standout mode (if possible) to mark selected articles on the menu, but when <strong>slow-mode</strong> is set, <em>nn</em> will just put an asterisk `*' next to the article identifier on selected articles.  Also when <strong>slow-mode</strong> is set <em>nn</em> will avoid redrawing the screen in the following cases:  After a <strong>goto-group</strong> command an empty menu is shown (hit <strong>space</strong> to make it appear), and after responding to an article, only the prompt line is shown (use ^L to redraw the screen).  To avoid redrawing the screen after an extended command, set the <strong>delay-redraw</strong> variable as well.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>slow-speed</strong> <em>speed</em>	(integer, default 1200)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the terminal is running at this baud rate or lower, the <strong>on</strong> slow (see the section on init files) condition will be true, and the <strong>on fast</strong> will be false (and vice-versa).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>sort</strong>		(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will sort articles according to the current <strong>sort-mode</strong> on entry to a group.  Otherwise, articles will be presented in order of arrival. If not set on entry to a menu for merged groups, the articles from each group will be kept together on the menu.  If <strong>sort</strong> is unset while merged groups are presented on the menu, the articles will be reordered by local article number (which may not keep articles from the same group together).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>sort-mode</strong> <em>mode</em>	(integer, default 1)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The default sort algorithm used to sort the articles on entry to a news group.  It is a numeric value corresponding to one of the sorting methods described in connection with the :sort command:</p>
<pre>
	0 - arrival (ordered by article number)
	1 - subject (subjects ordered after age of first article)
	2 - lexical (subjects in lexicographical order)
	3 - age (articles ordered after posting date only)
	4 - sender (articles ordered after sender's name)
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>spell-checker</strong> <em>shell-command</em>	(string, default not set)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, responses can be checked for spelling mistakes via the (i)spell action.  The command to perform the spelling is given the file containing the full article including header as its only argument.  If the spell checker can fix spelling mistakes, it must apply the changes directly to this file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>split</strong>		(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, digests will automatically and silently be split into sub-articles which are then handled transparently as normal articles. Otherwise, digests are presented as one article (which you can split on demand with the <strong>G</strong> command).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>stop</strong> <em>lines</em>	(integer, default not set)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When <strong>stop</strong> is set, <em>nn</em> will only show the first <em>lines</em> lines of the of each article before prompting you to continue.  This is useful on slow terminals and modem lines to be able to see the first few lines of longer articles (and skipping the rest with the <strong>n</strong> command).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>subject-match-limit</strong> <em>length</em>	(integer, default 256)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Subjects will be considered identical if their first <em>length</em> characters match.  Setting this uncritically to a low value may cause unexpected results!</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>subject-match-offset</strong> <em>offset</em>	(integer, default 0)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set to a positive number, that many characters at the beginning of the subject will be ignored when comparing subjects for ordering and equality purposes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>subject-match-parts</strong>	(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, two subjects will be considered equal if they are identical up to the first (differing) digit.  Together with the <strong>subject-match-offset</strong> variable, this can be used in source groups where the subject often has a format like:</p>
<pre>
	vXXXXXX: Name of the package (Part 01/04)
</pre>
<p>Setting <strong>subject-match-offset</strong> to 8 and <strong>subject-match-parts</strong> to true will make <em>nn</em> consider all four parts of the package having the same subject (and thus be selectable with `*').</p><p>Notice that changing the <strong>subject-match-</strong>... variables manually will not have an immediate effect.  To reorder the menu, an explicit <strong>:sort</strong> command must be performed.  These variables are mainly intended to be set using the <strong>:local</strong> command in <strong>on entry</strong> macros for source and binary groups (entry macros are evaluated before the menu is collected and sorted).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>subject-match-minimum</strong> <em>characters</em>	(integer, default 4)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set to a positive number, that many characters at the beginning of the subject must match before the subject-match-parts option comes into affect.  This is important, because the part matching causes the rest of the line to be ignored after the first digit pair is discovered.  This begins after any subject-match-offset has been applied.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>suggest-default-save</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will present the <strong>default-save-file</strong> when prompting for a save file name in a group without a specific save file, or <strong>folder-save-file</strong> when saving from a folder.  When not set, no file name is presented, and to use the default save file, a single + must be specified.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>tidy-newsrc</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will automatically remove lines from .newsrc which represent groups not found in the active file or unsubscribed groups if <strong>keep-unsubscribed</strong> is not set.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>time</strong>		(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will show the current time in the prompt line. This is useful on systems without a <em>sysline (1)</em> utility.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>trace-folder-packing</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, a trace of the retained and deleted messages is printed when a folder is rewritten.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>trusted-escape-codes</strong> <em>codes</em>	(string, default none)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set to a list of one or more characters, <em>nn</em> will trust and output <em>escape</em> characters in an article if it is followed by one of the characters in the list.  For example, to switch to or from kanji mode, control codes like "<em>esc</em>&nbsp;$" and "<em>esc</em>&nbsp;(&nbsp;J" may be present in the text.  To allow these codes, use the following command:</p>
<pre>
	set trusted-escape-codes ($
</pre>
<p>You can also set it to <strong>all</strong> to pass all espace codes through to the screen.  Notice that <em>nn</em> thinks all characters (including <em>esc</em>) output to the screen as occupy one column.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>unshar-command</strong> <em>shell-command</em>	(string, default "/bin/sh")</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is the command which is invoked by the <strong>unshar</strong> command.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>unshar-header-file</strong> <em>file</em>	(string, default "Unshar.Headers")</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The name of the file in which the header and initial text of articles unpacked with the <strong>:unshar</strong> command is saved.  Unless the file name starts with a `/', the file will be created in the same directory as the unpacked files.  The information is not saved if this variable is not set.  Setting it to "Unshar.Result" will cause the headers and the results from the unpacking process to be merged in a meaningful way (unless <strong>mmdf-format</strong> is set).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>unsubscribe-mark-read</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, unsubscribing to a group will automatically mark all current articles read; this is recommended to keep the size of .newsrc down. Otherwise, unread articles in the unsubscribe groups are kept in .newsrc.  If <strong>keep-unsubscribed</strong> is false, this variable has no effect.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>update-frequency</strong>		(integer, default 1)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies how many changes need to be done to the .newsrc or select files before they are written back to disk.  The default setting causes .newsrc to be updated every time a group has been read.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>use-editor-line</strong>		(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Most editors accept arguments of the form:</p>
<pre>
	editor [-arguments] +n filename
</pre>
<p>where editor is the name of the editor, and n is the line number to put the cursor upon entering the file.  If use-editor-line is false, it will not add the "+n" to the arguments.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>use-path-in-from</strong>		(boolean, default false)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When <strong>mail-format</strong> is set, saved articles will be preceded by a specially formatted "From&nbsp;" line:</p>
<pre>
	From origin date
</pre>
<p>Normally, the origin will be the name of the news group where the article appeared, but if <strong>use-path-in-from</strong> is set, the contents of the "Path:" header will be used as the origin.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>use-selections</strong>		(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> uses the selections and other article attributes saved last time <em>nn</em> was used.  If not set, <em>nn</em> ignores the select file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>visible-bell</strong>	(boolean, default true)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will flash the screen instead of "ringing the bell" if the visible bell (flash) capability is defined in the termcap/terminfo database.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>window</strong> <em>size</em>	(integer, default not set)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set, <em>nn</em> will reserve the last <em>size</em> lines of the menu screen for a preview window.  If not set, <em>nn</em> will clear the screen to preview an article if there are less than <strong>min-window</strong> lines at the bottom of the screen.  As a side effect, it can also be used to reduce the size of the menus, which may be useful on slow terminals.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>word-key</strong> <em>key</em>	(key, default ^W)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The key which erases the last input component or word when <em>nn</em> is prompting for a string, e.g. the last name in a path name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>wrap-header-margin</strong> <em>size</em>	(integer, default 6)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set (non-negative), the customized header fields specified in <strong>header-lines</strong> will be split across several lines if they don't fit on one line.  When <em>size</em> is greater than zero, lines will be split at the first space occurring in the last <em>size</em> columns of the line.  If not set (or negative), long header lines will be truncated if they don't fit on a single line.</p>

<p>Normally, <em>nn</em> will just print a (high-lighted) single line header containing the author, subject, and date (optional) of the article when it is read.</p><p>By setting the <strong>header-lines</strong> variable as described below, it is possible to get a more informative multi line header with optional high-lighting and underlining.</p><p>The <strong>header-lines</strong> variable is set to a list of header line identifiers, and the customized headers will then contain exactly these header lines <em>in the specified order</em>.</p><p>The same specifications are also used by the <strong>:print</strong> and <strong>save-short</strong> commands via the <strong>print-header-lines</strong> and <strong>save-header-lines</strong> variables.</p><p>The following header line identifiers are recognized in the <strong>header-lines</strong>, <strong>print-header-lines</strong>, and <strong>save-header-lines</strong> variables:</p><p><strong>A</strong>	Approved:</p><p><strong>a</strong>	Spool-File:	(path of spool file containing the article)</p><p><strong>B</strong>	Distribution:</p><p><strong>C</strong>	Control:</p><p><strong>D</strong>	Date:</p><p><strong>d</strong>	Date-Received:</p><p><strong>F</strong>	From:</p><p><strong>f</strong>	Sender:</p><p><strong>G</strong>	Newsgroup:	(current group)</p><p><strong>g</strong>	Newsgroup:	(current group if cross-posted or merged)</p><p><strong>I</strong>	Message-Id:</p><p><strong>K</strong>	Keywords:</p><p><strong>L</strong>	Lines:</p><p><strong>N</strong>	Newsgroups:</p><p><strong>n</strong>	Newsgroups:   (but only if cross posted)</p><p><strong>O</strong>	Organization:</p><p><strong>P</strong>	Path:</p><p><strong>R</strong>	Reply-To:</p><p><strong>S</strong>	Subject:</p><p><strong>v</strong>	Save-File:	(the default save file for this article)</p><p><strong>W</strong>	Followup-To:</p><p><strong>X</strong>	References:</p><p><strong>x</strong>	Back-References:</p><p><strong>Y</strong>	Summary:</p><p>The 'G' and 'g' fields will include the local article number if it is known, e.g.</p>
<pre>
	Newsgroup: news.software.nn/754
</pre>
<p>The following special symbols are recognized in the <strong>header-lines</strong> variable (and ignored otherwise):</p><p>Preceding the identifier with an equal sign "=" or an underscore "_" will cause the header field contents to be high-lighted or underlined.</p><p>A plus sign "+" will use the shading attribute defined by <strong>shading-on</strong> and <strong>shading-off</strong> to high-light the field contents.  If no shading attribute is defined it will underline the field instead.</p><p>Including an asterisk "*" in the list will produce the standard one line header at that point.</p><p>Example:  The following setting of the <strong>header-lines</strong> variable will show the author (underlined), organization, posting date, and subject (high-lighted) when articles are read:</p>
<pre>
	set header-lines _FOD=S

<p>Some of the command line options have already been described, but below we provide a complete list of the effect of each option by showing the equivalent <strong>set</strong>, <strong>unset</strong>, or <strong>toggle</strong> command.</p><p>Besides the options described below, you can set <em>any</em> of <em>nn</em>'s variables directly on the command line via an argument of the following format:</p>
<pre>
	variable=value
</pre>
<p>To set or unset a boolean variable, the value can be specified as <em>on</em> or <em>off</em> (<em>t</em> and <em>f</em> will also work).</p><p>Notice that the init files are read <em>before</em> the options are parsed (unless you use the -<strong>I</strong> option).  Therefore, the options which are related to boolean variables set in the init file will toggle the value set there, rather than the default value. Consequently, the meaning of the options are also user-defined.</p><p>The explanations below describe the effect related to the default setting of the variables, with the `reverse' effect in square brackets.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">MACRO DEFINITIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Practically any combination of commands and key strokes can be defined as a macro which can be bound to a single key in menu and/or reading mode.</p><p>The macro definition must specify a sequence of commands and key strokes as if they were typed directly from the keyboard.  For example, a string specifying a file name must follow a save command. This manual does not give a complete specification of all the input required by the various commands; it is recommended to execute the desired command sequence from the keyboard prior to defining the macro to get the exact requirements of each command.</p><p>Although it is possible to define temporary macros interactively using the <strong>:define</strong> command, macro definitions are normally placed in the <em>init</em> file.  Macros are numbered from 0 to 100, i.e. it is possible to define a total of 101 different macros (implicit macros defined with the <strong>map</strong> command uses internal numbers from 101 to 200).</p><p>To define macro number <em>M</em>, the following construction is used (the line breaks are mandatory):</p>
<pre>
	<strong>define</strong> <em>M</em>
		<em>body</em>
	<strong>end</strong>
</pre>
<p>The <em>body</em> consists of a sequence of <em>tokens</em> separated by white space (blanks or newlines).  However, certain <em>tokens</em> continue to the end of the current line.</p><p>The following <em>tokens</em> may occur in the macro <em>body</em>:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>Comments</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Empty lines and text following a # character (preceded by white space) is ignored.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>Command Names</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Any command name listed in the key mapping section can be included in a macro causing that command to be invoked when the macro is executed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>Extended Commands</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>All the extended commands which can be executed through the <strong>command</strong> command (normally bound to the : key) can also be executed in a macro. An extended command starts with a colon (:) and continues to the end of the current line.  Example:</p>
<pre>
	:show groups total
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>Key Strokes</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A key stroke (which is normally mapped into a command depending on the current mode) is specified as a key name enclosed in single quotes. Examples (A-key, left arrow key, RETURN key):</p>
<pre>
	'A'  'left'  '^M'
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>Shell Commands</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>External commands can be invoked as part of a macro execution.  There are two forms of shell command invocations available depending on whether a command <em>may</em> produce output or require user input, or it is <em>guaranteed</em> to complete without input or output to the terminal.  The difference is that in the latter case, <em>nn</em> does not prepare the terminal to be used by another program.  When the command completes, the screen is <em>not</em> redrawn automatically; you should use the <strong>redraw</strong> command to do that. The tho forms are:</p>
<pre>
	:!echo this command uses the terminal
	:!!echo this command does not &gt; /tmp/file
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>Strings</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Input to commands prompting for a string, e.g. a file name, can be specified in a macro as a double quoted string.  Example (save without prompting for a file name):</p>
<pre>
	<strong>save-short</strong> "+$G"
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>Conditionals</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Conditionals may occur anywhere in a macro; a conditional is evaluated when the macro is executed, and if the condition is false <em>the rest</em> of the current line is ignored.  The following conditionals are available:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>?menu</strong>	True in menu mode
	<strong>?show</strong>	True in reading mode
	<strong>?folder</strong>	True when looking at a folder
	<strong>?group</strong>	True when looking at a news group
	<strong>?yes</strong>	Query user, true if answer is yes
	<strong>?no</strong>	Query user, true if answer is no
</pre>
<p>Example (stop macro execution if user rejects to continue):</p>
<pre>
	<strong>prompt</strong> "continue? " <strong>?no break</strong>
</pre>
<p>In addition to these conditionals, it is possible to test the current value of boolean and integer variables using the following form:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>?</strong><em>variable</em><strong>=</strong><em>value</em>
</pre>
<p>This conditional will be true (1) if the variable is an integer variable whose current value is the one specified, or (2) if the variable is a boolean variable which is either <strong>on</strong> or <strong>off</strong>.  Examples:</p>
<pre>
	?layout=3 :set layout 1
	?monitor=on  break
	?sort=off :sort age
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>break</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Terminate macro execution completely.  This includes nested macros. Example (stop if looking at a folder):</p>
<pre>
	<strong>?folder</strong> <strong>break</strong>
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>return</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Terminate execution of current macro.  If the current macro is called from another macro, execution of that macro continues immediately.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>input</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Query the user for a key stroke or a string, for example a file name. Example (prompt the user for a file name in the usual way):</p>
<pre>
	<strong>save-short</strong> <strong>input</strong>
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>yes</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Confirm unconditionally <em>if</em> a command requires confirmation.  It is ignored if the command does not require confirmation.  Example (confirm creation of new files):</p>
<pre>
	<strong>save-short</strong> "+$G" <strong>yes</strong>
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>no</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Terminate execution of current macro <em>if</em> a command requires confirmation; otherwise ignore it.  If neither <strong>yes</strong> nor <strong>no</strong> is specified when a command requires confirmation, the user must answer the question as usual - if the user confirms the action execution continues normally; otherwise the execution of the current macro is terminated.  Example (do not create new files):</p>
<pre>
	<strong>save-short</strong> "+$L/misc" <strong>no</strong>
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>prompt</strong> <em>string</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Print the <em>string</em> in the prompt line (highlighted).  The string must be enclosed in double quotes.  Example:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>prompt</strong> "Enter recipient name"
</pre>
<p>When the macro terminates, the original prompt shown on entry to the macro will automatically be redrawn.  If this is not desirable (e.g. if the macro goes from selection to reading mode), the redrawing of the prompt can be disabled by using a <strong>prompt</strong> command with an empty <em>string</em> ("").  Example:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>prompt</strong> "Enter reading mode?" # old prompt is saved
	?no return # and old prompt is restored
	read-skip       # changes the prompt
	<strong>prompt</strong> "" # so forget old prompt
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>echo</strong> <em>string</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Display the <em>string</em> in the prompt line for a short period.  Example:</p>
<pre>
	?show <strong>echo</strong> "Cannot be used in reading mode" break
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>puts</strong> <em>string-to-end-of-line</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The rest of the line is output directly to the terminal without interpretation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>macro</strong> <em>M</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Invoke macro number <em>M</em>.  The maximum macro nesting level is five (also catches macro loops).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>I use the following macro to quickly save all the selected files in a file whose name is entered as usual.  It also works in reading mode (saving just the current article).</p>
<pre>
	<strong>define</strong> 1
		:unset save-report
		save-short input yes
		?menu '+'
		:set save-report
	<strong>end</strong>
</pre>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">KEY MAPPINGS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The descriptions of the keys and commands provided in this manual reflects the default key mappings in <em>nn</em>.  However, you can easily change these mappings to match your personal demands, and it is also possible to remap keys depending on the terminal in use. Permanent remapping of keys must be done through the <em>init</em> file, while temporary changes (for the duration of the current invocation of <em>nn</em>) can be made with the <strong>:map</strong> command.</p><p>The binding and mapping of keys are controlled by four tables:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>The multikey definition table</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This table is used for mapping multicharacter key sequences into single characters.  By default the table contains the mappings for the four cursor keys, and there is room for 10 user-defined multikeys. The fourteen multikeys are named: <strong>up</strong>, <strong>down</strong>, <strong>right</strong>, <strong>left</strong> (the four arrow keys), and <strong>#0</strong> through <strong>#9</strong> for the user-defined keys.</p><p>Multikey #<em>i</em> (where <em>i</em> is a digit or an arrow key name) is defined using the following command:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>map #</strong><em>i</em> <em>key-sequence</em>
</pre>
<p>where the <em>sequence</em> is a list of 7-bit character names (see below) separated by spaces. For example, if the HOME key sends the sequence ESC [ H, you can define multikey #0 to be the home key using the command:</p>
<pre>
	map #0 ^[ [ H
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>The input key mapping table</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>All characters that are read from the keyboard will be mapped through the input mapping table.  Consequently, you can globally remap one key to produce any other key value.  By default all keys are mapped into themselves.</p><p>An entry in the input key mapping table to map <em>input-key</em> into <em>new-key</em> is made with the command</p>
<pre>
	<strong>map key</strong> <em>input-key</em> <em>new-key</em>
</pre>
<p>For example, to make your ESC key function as <strong>interrupt</strong> you can use the command</p>
<pre>
	map key ^[ ^G
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>The selection mode key binding table</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This table defines for each key which command should be invoked when that key is pressed in selection mode, i.e. when the article menu is shown.  The command to bind a <em>key</em> to a <em>command</em> in selection mode is:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>map menu</strong> <em>key command</em>
</pre>
<p>For example, to have the HOME key defined as multikey #0 above bound to the <strong>select</strong> command, the following command is used:</p>
<pre>
	map menu #0 select
</pre>
<p>To remap a key to select a specific article on the menu (which the `a' through `z' keys do by default), the <em>command</em> must be specified as `<strong>article</strong> <em>N</em>' where <em>N</em> is the entry number on the menu counted from zero (i.e. a=0, b=1, ..., z=25, 0=26, ..., 9=35). For example, to map `J' to select article `j', the following command is used:</p>
<pre>
	map menu J article 9
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>The reading mode key binding table</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This table defines for each key which command should be invoked when that key is pressed in reading mode, i.e. when the article text is shown.  The command to bind a <em>key</em> to a <em>command</em> in reading mode is:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>map show</strong> <em>key command</em>
</pre>

  </dd>

</dl>
<p>In addition to the direct mappings described above, the following variations of the <strong>map</strong> command are available:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>User defined keymaps</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Additional keymaps can be defined using the command</p>
<pre>
	<strong>make map</strong> <em>newmap</em>
</pre>
<p>This will create a new keymap which can initialized using normal <strong>map</strong> commands, e.g.</p>
<pre>
	<strong>map</strong> <em>newmap key command</em>
</pre>
<p>To activate a user-defined keymap, it must be bound to a <em>prefix key</em>:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>map</strong> <em>base-map prefix-key</em> <strong>prefix</strong> <em>newmap</em>
</pre>
<p>When used, the prefix key itself does not activate a command, but instead it require another key to be entered and then execute the command bound to that key in the keymap which is bound to the prefix key.</p>
<pre>
  For example, to let the key sequence "^X i" execute macro number 10 in
</pre>
<p>both modes, the following commands can be used:</p>
<pre>
	make map ctl-x
	map ctl-x i macro 10
	map both ^X prefix ctl-x
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Mapping keys in both modes</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Using the pseudo-keymap `both', it is possible to map a key to a command in both selection and reading mode at once.  For example, to map the home key to macro number 5 in both modes, the following command can be used:</p>
<pre>
	map both #0 macro 5
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Aliasing</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A key can also be mapped directly to the command currently bound to another key.  Later remapping of the other key will not change the mapping of the `aliased' key.  This is done using the following command:</p>
<pre>
	map <em>keymap new-key</em> <strong>as</strong> <em>old-key</em>
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Binding macros to keys</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A previously defined macro can be bound to a key using the command:</p>
<pre>
	map <em>keymap key</em> <strong>macro</strong> <em>macro-number</em>
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Implicit macro definitions</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>An implicit macro can also be defined directly in connection with the <strong>map</strong> command:</p>
<pre>
	map <em>keymap key</em> <strong>(</strong>
	<em>body</em>...
	<strong>)</strong>
</pre>

  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Keys and character names are specified using the following notation:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>C</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A single printable character represents the key or character itself.</p>

<p>If the variable <strong>data-bits</strong> is 7, key maps can specify binding of all keys in the range 0x00 to 0x7F, and the 8th bit will be stripped in all keyboard input. If the variable <strong>data-bits</strong> is 8, the 8th bit is not cleared, and key maps are extended to allow binding of keys in the range 0xA0 to 0xFE (corresponding to the national characters defined by the ISO 8859 character sets). Binding commands to these keys can be done either by using their numeric value, or directly specifying the 8 bit character in the map command, e.g.</p>

<p>The <em>init</em> files are used to customize <em>nn</em>'s behaviour to local conventions and restrictions and to satisfy each user's personal taste.</p><p>Normally, <em>nn</em> reads upto three init files on start-up if they exist (all init files are optional):</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>$LIB/<strong>setup</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A system-wide file located in the library directory.  This file is <em>always</em> loaded before any other init file (even when the -<strong>I</strong> option is specified).  It cannot contain a group presentation sequence.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>$LIB/<strong>init</strong></p>
  </dt>

    <p><strong>Variable settings</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You can <strong>set</strong> (or <strong>unset</strong>) all the variables described earlier to change nn's behaviour permanently.  The <strong>set</strong> and <strong>unset</strong> commands you can use in the init file have exactly the same format as the <strong>:set</strong> and <strong>:unset</strong> commands described earlier (except that the : prefix is omitted.)</p><p>Variables can also be locked via the <strong>lock</strong> command; this is typically done in the <em>setup</em> file to enforce local policies.</p>

</pre>
<p>The character <strong>@</strong> in the <em>file</em> will be replaced by the terminal type defined in the TERM environment variable.  <em>nn</em> silently ignores the <strong>load</strong> command if the file does not exist (so you don't have to have a specific init file for terminals which does not require remapping). If the file is not specified by an absolute pathname, it must reside in your ~/.nn directory.  Examples:</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">COMMAND GROUPS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Command groups may only occur in the init file, and they provide a way to have series of commands executed at certain points during news reading.</p><p>In release 6.4 onwards, these possibilities are still rather rudimentary, and a mixture of normal init file syntax and macro syntax is used depending on whether the command group is only executed on start-up or several times during the <em>nn</em> session.</p><p>A command group begins with the word <strong>on</strong> and ends with the word <strong>end</strong>.  The following command groups are conditionally executed during the parsing of the init file if the specified <em>condition</em> is true.  They may also have an optional <strong>else</strong> part which is executed if the <em>condition</em> is false:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>on</strong> <em>condition</em>
		commands
	[ <strong>else</strong>
		commands ]
	<strong>end</strong>
</pre>
<p>The following conditional command groups may be used in the init file to be executed at start-up:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>on [</strong> <em>test</em> <strong>]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The commands (init file syntax) in the group are executed only if the specified <em>test</em> is true. A shell is spawned to execute the command "[ <em>test</em> ]", so all the options of the <a href="../man1/test.1.html"><strong>test</strong>(1)</a> command is available.  For example, to unset the flow-control variable if the tty is a pseudo-tty, the following conditional can be used:</p>
<pre>
	on [ -n "`tty | grep ttyp`" ]
		unset flow-control
	end
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>on !</strong><em>shell command</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command group is executed if the given <em>shell command</em> exits with 0 status (success). Care should be taken that the command does not produce any output, e.g. by redirecting its output to /dev/null.  For example, to prevent people from reading news if load is above a specific level, the following conditional might be placed in the global setup file.</p>
<pre>
	on !load-above 5
		error load is too high, try again later.
	end
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>on `</strong><em>shell command</em>\|<strong>`</strong> <em>string</em>...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command group is executed if the <em>first output line</em> from executing the specified <em>shell command</em> is listed among the specified <em>string</em> values.  The <em>shell command</em> can be omitted on subsequent occurrences of this conditional, in which case the output from the last <strong>shell command</strong> is used. For example, the following conditional can be used to switch to an init file which has a limited sequence for news reading during working hours, evenings, and nights:</p>
<pre>
	on `date +%H` 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
		chain init.work
	end
	on `` 17 18 19 20 21
		chain init.evening
	else
		chain init.night
	end
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>on ``</strong> <em>string</em>...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is equivalent to the previous form except that instead of executing a shell command, the output from the previous</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>on $</strong><em>variable</em> [ <em>value</em> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If no <em>value</em> strings are specified, the command group is executed if the given <em>variable</em> is defined in the environment.  Otherwise, the command group is executed only if the value of the <em>variable</em> occur in the <em>value</em> list.  For example, if you want <em>nn</em> to look for mail in whatever $MAIL is set to - if it is set - you can use the following code:</p>
<pre>
	on $MAIL
		set mail $(MAIL)
	end
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>on slow</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The commands (init file syntax) in the group are executed only if the current terminal output speed is less than or equal to the baud rate set in the <strong>slow-speed</strong> variable.  This can be used to optimize the user-interface for slow terminals by setting suitable variables:</p>
<pre>
	<strong>on slow</strong>
		set confirm-entry
		set slow-mode
		set delay-redraw
		unset visible-bell
		set compress
		unset header-lines
		set stop 5
		set window 10
	<strong>end</strong>
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>on fast</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Same as <strong>on slow</strong> except that the commands are only executed when the terminal is running at a speed above the <strong>slow-speed</strong> value.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>on term</strong> <em>term-type</em>...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The commands are executed if one of the <em>term-type</em> names is identical to value of the TERM environment variable.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>on host</strong> <em>host-name</em>...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The commands are executed if the local host's name occur in the <em>host-name</em> list.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>on program</strong> <em>program-name</em>...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The commands are executed if the current program (<em>nn</em>, <em>nncheck</em>, etc) in the <em>program-name</em> list.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The following <strong>on</strong> command groups are really macros which may be executed during <em>nn</em>'s normal processing, and as such they cannot have an <strong>else</strong> part.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>on entry</strong> [ <em>group list</em> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>These commands (macro format!) are executed every time <em>nn</em> enters a news group.  If a group list is not specified, the commands are associated with all groups which don't have its own entry macro specified in the group sequence.  Otherwise, the entry macro will be associated with the groups in the list.  The group list is specified using the meta-notations described in the presentation sequence section.</p><p><em>All</em> `:' commands at the beginning of the command group are executed <em>before</em> <em>nn</em> collects the articles in the group, so it is possible to set or unset variables like <strong>cross-post</strong> and <strong>auto-read-mode-limit</strong> before any articles are collected and the menu is (not) shown.</p>
<pre>
  The non-`:' commands, and `:' commands that follows a command of
</pre>
<p>another type will be executed immediately <em>after</em> the first menu page is presented.  The execution of a `:' command can be postponed by using a double `::' as the command prefix.</p>
<pre>
	<strong>on entry</strong> comp.sources* alt.sources
		:set cross-post on   # set before collection
		:local auto-read-mode-limit -1   # set before showing menu
		::unset cross-post   # set after collection
	<strong>end</strong>
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>on start-up</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>These `:' commands (macro format!) are executed on start-up just before <em>nn</em> enters the first news group.  However, postponed commands (i.e. non-`:' commands) will not be executed until the first group is shown (it works like an entry macro).</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">GROUP PRESENTATION SEQUENCE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>News groups are normally presented in the sequence defined in the system-wide <strong>init</strong> file in <em>nn</em>'s library directory.</p><p>You can personalize the presentation sequence by specifying an alternative sequence in the private <em>init</em> file. The sequence in the private init file is used <em>before</em> the global presentation sequence, and need only describe the deviations from the default presentation sequence.</p><p>The presentation sequence must start with the word</p>
<pre>
	<strong>sequence</strong>
</pre>
<p>followed by a list of the news group names in the order you want them to be presented. The group names must be separated by white space. The sequence list must be the <em>last</em> part of the init file (the parsing of commands from the init file stops when the word <strong>sequence</strong> is encountered).</p><p>You may use a full group name like "comp.unix.questions", or just the name of a main group or subgroup, e.g. "comp" or "comp.unix". However, if "comp" precedes "comp.unix.questions" in the list, this subgroup will be placed in the normal alphabetic sequence during the collection of all the "comp" groups.</p><p>Groups which are not explicitly mentioned in any of the sequence files will be placed after the mentioned groups, unless `!!' is used and it has not been disabled (as described below).</p><p>Each group name may be followed by a file or folder name (must start with either of `/' `~' or `+') which will specify the default save file for that group (and its subgroups).  A single `+' following the group name is an abbreviation for the last save file name used. For example, the following two sequences are equivalent:</p>
<pre>
	group1 +file group2 +file group3 +file
	group1 +file group2 + group3 +
</pre>
<p>When an article is saved, the default save name will be used as the initial contents of the file name prompt for further editing.  It therefore does not need to be be a complete file name (unless you use the quick save mode).</p><p>Each group name may also be associated with a so-called <strong>entry action</strong>.  This is basically an (unnamed) macro which is invoked on entry to the group (following the same rules as the `on entry' command group related to :set and :unset commands).</p><p>The entry action begins with a left parenthesis `<strong>(</strong>' and ends with a right parenthesis `<strong>)</strong>' on an otherwise empty line:</p>
<pre>
	comp.sources. +src/$L/ (
		:set cross-post
	)
</pre>
<p>The last entry action can be repeated by specifying an empty set of parenthesis, e.g.</p>
<pre>
	comp.unix. +unix ()
</pre>
<p>The entry action of a preceding group in the sequence can be associated with the current group(s) by specifying the name of the group in the parentheses instead of the commands, e.g.</p>
<pre>
	comp.unix. +unix (comp.sources.unix)
</pre>
<p>A macro can also be associated with the entry action by specifying its number in the same way as the group name above, e.g.</p>
<pre>
	rec.music. +music (30)
</pre>
<p>Notice that it is the <em>current</em> definition of the macro which is associated with the group, so if the macro is later redefined with the `:define' command, it will not have any effect on the entry action.</p><p>Group names can be specified using the following notations:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>group.name</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Append the group (if it exists) to the presentation sequence list.  If <strong>also-subgroups</strong> is set (default), all subscribed subgroups of the group will be included as well (if there are any).  Examples: "comp", "comp.unix", "comp.unix.questions".  If the group does not exits (e.g. "comp"), the subgroups will be included even when <strong>also-subgroups</strong> is not set, i.e. "comp" is equivalent to "comp.".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>group.name.</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Append the subgroups of the specified group to the presentation sequence.  The group itself (if it exists) is not included. Examples: "comp.", "comp.unix.".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>.group.name</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Append the groups whose name ends with the specified name to the sequence.  Example: ".test".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>group.name*</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Append the group and its subgroups to the presentation sequence list (even when <strong>also-subgroups</strong> is not set).  Example: "comp.unix*".</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The following meta notation can be used in a sequence file.  The group.name can be specified using any of the forms described above:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>! groups</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Completely ignore the group or groups specified unless they are already in the presentation sequence (i.e. has been explicitly mentioned earlier in the sequence).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>!:<em>code</em> groups</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Ignore a selection of groups based on the given <em>code</em> letter (see below), unless they are already included in the sequence.  Notice that these forms <em>only</em> excludes groups from the presentation sequence, i.e. they <em>do not</em> include the remaining groups at this point; that must be done explicitly elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Ignore unsubscribed groups, i.e. if they are neither new, nor present and subscribed in .newsrc. This is useful to ignore a whole hierarchy except for a few groups which are explicitly mentioned in .newsrc and still see new groups as they are created.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>!:X groups</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Ignore unsubscribed <em>and</em> new groups, i.e. if they are not currently present and subscribed in .newsrc. This is useful to ignore a whole hierarchy except for a few groups which are explicitly mentioned in .newsrc.  New groups in the hierarchy are ignored unless `NEW' occurs earlier in the sequence.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>!:O groups</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Ignore old groups, i.e. <em>unless</em> they are new.  This is useful to ignore a whole hierarchy but still see new groups which are created in the hierarchy (it might become interesting some day).  Individual groups can still be included in the sequence if they are specified before the `!:O' entry.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>!:N groups</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Ignore new groups in the hierarchy.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>!!</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Stop building the presentation sequence.  This eliminates all groups that are not already in the presentation sequence.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>NEW</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a pseudo group name which matches all <em>new</em> groups; you could place this symbol early in your presentation sequence to see new groups `out of sequence' (to attract your attention to them).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>RC</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a pseudo group name which matches all groups occurring in the .newsrc file.  It will cause the groups in .newsrc to be appended to the presentation sequence in the sequence in which they are listed in .newsrc.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>RC:</strong><em>number</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Similar to the <strong>RC</strong> entry, but limited to the first <em>number</em> lines of the .newsrc file.  Example: RC:10 (use 10 lines of .newsrc).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>RC:</strong><em>string</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Similar to the <strong>RC</strong> entry, but limited to the lines up to (and including) the first line (i.e. group) starting with the given <em>string</em>.  For example:  RC:alt.sources</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&lt; group.name</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Place the group (and its subgroups) at the beginning of the presentation sequence.  Notice that each `&lt;' entry will place the group(s) at the beginning of the current sequence, i.e. &lt; A &lt; B &lt; C will generate the sequence C B A.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&gt; group.name</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Place the group (and its subgroups) after all other groups that are and will be entered into the presentation sequence.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>@</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Disable the `!!' command.  This can be included in the personal presentation sequence if the global <strong>sequence</strong> file contains a !! entry (see example 1 below).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>% .... %</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Starts and ends a region of the sequence where it is possible to include groups which has been eliminated earlier.  This may be useful to alter the sequence of some groups, e.g. to place comp.sources.bugs after all other source groups, the following sequence can be used:</p><p>! comp.sources.bugs comp.sources* % comp.sources.bugs %</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> In a company where ordinary users only should read the local news groups, and ignore the rest (including new news groups which are otherwise always subscribed to initially), can use the following global presentation sequence:</p>
<pre>
	general
	follow
	! local.test
	local
	!!
</pre>
<p>The "expert" users in the company must put the <strong>@</strong> command somewhere in their private sequence to avoid losing news groups which they have not explicitly mentioned in their init file.</p><p><strong>Example 2:</strong> This is the global sequence for systems with heavy news addicts who setup their own sequences anyway.</p>
<pre>
	# all must read the general news first
	&lt; general

	# test is test, and junk is junk,
	# so it is placed at the very end
	&gt; test
	&gt; .test
	&gt; junk

	# this is the standard sequence which everybody may
	# change to their own liking
	local	# our local groups
	dk	# the Danish groups
	eunet.general # to present it before eunet.followup
	eunet	# the other European groups
	comp	# the serious groups
	news	# news on news
	sci	# other serious groups
	rec	# not really that important (don't quote me)
	misc	# well, it must be somewhere

	# the groups that are not listed above goes here
</pre>
<p>Notice the use of comments in the sequence where they are allowed at the end of non-empty lines as well.</p><p><strong>Example 3:</strong> My own presentation sequence (in the init file) simply lists my favourite groups and the corresponding default save files:</p>
<pre>
   <strong>sequence</strong>
	!:U alt*  # ignore unsubscribed alt groups
	news.software.nn +nn
	comp.sys.ti* +ti/$L
	NEW  # show new groups here
	news*
	rec.music.synth +synth/
	comp.emacs*,gnu.emacs +emacs/misc
	comp.risks +risks
	eunet.sources +src/unix/
	comp.sources* +src/$L/
</pre>
<p>The presentation sequence is not used when <em>nn</em> is called with one or more news group names on the command line; it is thus possible to read ignored groups (on explicit request) wihtout changing the init file. (Of course, you can also use the <strong>G</strong> command to read ignored groups).</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">MERGING NEWS GROUPS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The third example above contains the following line:</p>
<pre>
	comp.emacs*,gnu.emacs +emacs/misc
</pre>
<p>This is the syntax used to <em>merge</em> groups.  When two or more groups are merged, all new articles in these groups are presented together as if they were one group.  To merge groups, their names must be listed together in the sequence, and only separated by a single comma.  To merge the groups resulting from a single group pattern (e.g. comp.emacs*), the group pattern must be followed by a comma and a blank (e.g. comp.emacs*, ...).</p><p>Merged groups are presented as the first group in the "list", and the word "MERGED" will be shown after the group name.  The <strong>Y</strong> {<strong>overview</strong>} command will still show merged groups as individual groups, but they will be annotated with the symbol `&' on the first of the groups, and a `+' on the rest of the groups.</p><p>In the current version, the concept of the <em>current group</em> in connection with merged groups is a bit fuzzy.  This should only be noticeable with the <strong>G</strong> command, which will take the most recently used group among the merged groups as the current group.  So things like <strong>G = ...</strong> may not always work as expected.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The following environment variables are used by <em>nn</em>:</p><p><strong>EDITOR</strong>. The editor invoked when editing replies, follow-ups, and composing mail.  <em>nn</em> knows about the following editors: <em>vi</em>, <em>ded</em>, <em>GNU emacs</em>, and <em>micro-emacs</em>, and will try to position the cursor on the first line following the header, i.e. after the blank line which must not be deleted!  If an article has been included, the cursor is placed on the first line of the included text (to allow you to delete sections easily).</p><p><strong>LOGNAME</strong>. This is taken as the login name of the current user.  It is used by <em>nn</em> to return failed mail.  If it is not defined, <em>nn</em> will use the value of USER, or if that is not defined either, <em>nn</em> will use the call `who am i' to get this information.  If all attempts fail, the failed mail is dropped in the bit bucket.</p><p><strong>PAGER</strong>. This is used as the initial value of the <strong>pager</strong> variable.</p><p><strong>SHELL</strong>. This is the shell which is spawned if the system cannot suspend <em>nn</em>, and it will be used to execute the shell escapes.</p><p><strong>TERM</strong>. The terminal type.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">NOTES</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>When <strong>NNTP</strong> is being used over a slow link (as with the <em>ppp</em> protocol and a modem), it may be desirable to suppress the retrieval of the information about new newsgroups, and their purpose, since they can be hundreds of KBytes in size. To do this, the <strong>new-group-action</strong> and <strong>show-purpose-mode</strong> variables should be set to 0 in your <em>init</em> file.  See the descriptions of those variables for more info.</p><p>Unfortunately, the list of active newsgroups is still fetched, since nn uses it to determine which groups to check for new articles.  Even this could be avoided, but the cost would be checking for new articles in every group, which might well be slower overall, although startup would be faster.</p>
