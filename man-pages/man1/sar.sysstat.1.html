        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <strong>sar</strong> command writes to standard output the contents of selected cumulative activity counters in the operating system. The accounting system, based on the values in the <em>count</em> and <em>interval</em> parameters, writes information the specified number of times spaced at the specified intervals in seconds. If the <em>interval</em> parameter is set to zero, the <strong>sar</strong> command displays the average statistics for the time since the system was started. If the <em>interval</em> parameter is specified without the <em>count</em> parameter, then reports are generated continuously. The collected data can also be saved in the file specified by the -o <em>filename</em> flag, in addition to being displayed onto the screen. If <em>filename</em> is omitted, <strong>sar</strong> uses the standard system activity daily data file (see below). By default all the data available from the kernel are saved in the data file.</p><p>The <strong>sar</strong> command extracts and writes to standard output records previously saved in a file. This file can be either the one specified by the -f flag or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file. It is also possible to enter -1, -2 etc. as an argument to <strong>sar</strong> to display data of that days ago. For example, -1 will point at the standard system activity file of yesterday.</p><p>Standard system activity daily data files are named <em>saDD</em> or <em>saYYYYMMDD</em>, where YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the current month and DD for the current day. They are the default files used by <strong>sar</strong> only when no filename has been explicitly specified. When used to write data to files (with its option -o), <strong>sar</strong> will use <em>saYYYYMMDD</em> if option -D has also been specified, else it will use <em>saDD</em>. When used to display the records previously saved in a file, <strong>sar</strong> will look for the most recent of <em>saDD</em> and <em>saYYYYMMDD</em>, and use it.</p><p>Standard system activity daily data files are located in the <em>/var/log/sysstat</em> directory by default. Yet it is possible to specify an alternate location for them: If a directory (instead of a plain file) is used with options -f or -o then it will be considered as the directory containing the data files.</p><p>Without the -P flag, the <strong>sar</strong> command reports system-wide (global among all processors) statistics, which are calculated as averages for values expressed as percentages, and as sums otherwise. If the -P flag is given, the <strong>sar</strong> command reports activity which relates to the specified processor or processors. If -P ALL is given, the <strong>sar</strong> command reports statistics for each individual processor and global statistics among all processors.</p><p>You can select information about specific system activities using flags. Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity. Specifying the -A flag selects all possible activities.</p><p>The default version of the <strong>sar</strong> command (CPU utilization report) might be one of the first facilities the user runs to begin system activity investigation, because it monitors major system resources. If CPU utilization is near 100 percent (user + nice + system), the workload sampled is CPU-bound.</p><p>If multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it is convenient to specify an output file for the <strong>sar</strong> command. Run the <strong>sar</strong> command as a background process. The syntax for this is:</p><p><strong>sar -o datafile interval count &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1 &</strong></p><p>All data are captured in binary form and saved to a file (datafile). The data can then be selectively displayed with the <strong>sar</strong> command using the -f option. Set the <em>interval</em> and <em>count</em> parameters to select <em>count</em> records at <em>interval</em> second intervals. If the <em>count</em> parameter is not set, all the records saved in the file will be selected. Collection of data in this manner is useful to characterize system usage over a period of time and determine peak usage hours.</p><p>Note:	The <strong>sar</strong> command only reports on local activities.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    -A
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is equivalent to specifying <strong>-bBdFHqrRSuvwWy -I SUM -I XALL -m ALL -n ALL -u ALL -P ALL</strong>.</p>

This is not a count of page faults that generate I/O, because some page faults can be resolved without I/O.</p><p><strong>majflt/s</strong></p><p>Number of major faults the system has made per second, those which have required loading a memory page from disk.</p><p><strong>pgfree/s</strong></p><p>Number of pages placed on the free list by the system per second.</p><p><strong>pgscank/s</strong></p><p>Number of pages scanned by the kswapd daemon per second.</p><p><strong>pgscand/s</strong></p><p>Number of pages scanned directly per second.</p><p><strong>pgsteal/s</strong></p><p>Number of pages the system has reclaimed from cache (pagecache and swapcache) per second to satisfy its memory demands.</p><p><strong>%vmeff</strong></p><p>Calculated as pgsteal / pgscan, this is a metric of the efficiency of page reclaim. If it is near 100% then almost every page coming off the tail of the inactive list is being reaped. If it gets too low (e.g. less than 30%) then the virtual memory is having some difficulty. This field is displayed as zero if no pages have been scanned during the interval of time.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Extract records from <em>filename</em> (created by the -o <em>filename</em> flag). The default value of the <em>filename</em> parameter is the current standard system activity daily data file. If <em>filename</em> is a directory instead of a plain file then it is considered as the directory where the standard system activity daily data files are located. The -f option is exclusive of the -o option.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>If this variable exists and its value is <strong>ISO</strong> then the current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report header. The <strong>sar</strong> command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.</p>

    <p>If this variable exists and its value is <strong>UTC</strong> then <strong>sar</strong> will save its data in UTC time (data will still be displayed in local time). <strong>sar</strong> will also use UTC time instead of local time to determine the current daily data file located in the <em>/var/log/sysstat</em> directory.
