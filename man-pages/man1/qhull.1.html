      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Qhull is a general dimension code for computing convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagram, furthest\[hy]site Voronoi diagram, furthest\[hy]site Delaunay triangulations, and halfspace intersections about a point.  It implements the Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull.  Qhull handles round\[hy]off errors from floating point arithmetic.  It can approximate a convex hull.</p><p>The program includes options for hull volume, facet area, partial hulls, input transformations, randomization, tracing, multiple output formats, and execution statistics.  The program can be called from within your application. You can view the results in 2\[hy]d, 3\[hy]d and 4\[hy]d with Geomview.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The format of input is the following: first line contains the dimension, second line contains the number of input points, and point coordinates follow. The dimension and number of points can be reversed. Comments and line breaks are ignored.  A comment starts with a non\[hy]numeric character and continues to the end of line.  The first comment is reported in summaries and statistics. Error reporting is better if there is one point per line.</p><p>The default printout option is a short summary. There are many other output formats.</p><p>Qhull implements the Quickhull algorithm for convex hull. This algorithm combines the 2\[hy]d Quickhull algorithm with the n\[hy]d beneath\[hy]beyond algorithm [c.f., Preparata & Shamos '85]. It is similar to the randomized algorithms of Clarkson and others [Clarkson et al. '93].  The main advantages of Quickhull are output sensitive performance, reduced space requirements, and automatic handling of precision problems.</p><p>The data structure produced by Qhull consists of vertices, ridges, and facets. A vertex is a point of the input set.  A ridge is a set of d vertices and two neighboring facets.  For example in 3\[hy]d, a ridge is an edge of the polyhedron.  A facet is a set of ridges, a set of neighboring facets, a set of incident vertices, and a hyperplane equation.  For simplicial facets, the ridges are defined by the vertices and neighboring facets.  When Qhull merges two facets, it produces a non\[hy]simplicial facet.  A non\[hy]simplicial facet has more than d neighbors and may share more than one ridge with a neighbor.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">IMPRECISION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Since Qhull uses floating point arithmetic, roundoff error may occur for each calculation.  This causes  problems for most geometric algorithms.</p><p>Qhull automatically sets option 'C-0' in 2\[hy]d, 3\[hy]d, and 4\[hy]d, or option 'Qx' in 5\[hy]d and higher.  These options handle precision problems by merging facets.  Alternatively, use option 'QJ' to joggle the input.</p><p>With 'C-0', Qhull merges non\[hy]convex facets while constructing the hull. The remaining facets are clearly convex. With 'Qx', Qhull merges coplanar horizon facets, flipped facets, concave facets and duplicated ridges.  It merges coplanar facets after constructing the hull. With 'Qx', coplanar points may be missed, but it appears to be unlikely.</p><p>To guarantee triangular output, joggle the input with option 'QJ'.  Facet merging will not occur.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>To get a list of the most important options, execute 'qhull' by itself. To get a complete list of options, execute 'qhull -'. To get a complete, concise list of options, execute 'qhull .'.</p><p>Options can be in any order. Capitalized options take an argument (except 'PG' and 'F' options). Single letters are used for output formats and precision constants.  The other options are grouped into menus for other output formats ('F'), Geomview output ('G'), printing ('P'), Qhull control ('Q'), and tracing ('T').</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Compute the Delaunay triangulation by lifting the input points to a paraboloid.  The 'o' option prints the input points and facets. The 'QJ' option guarantees triangular output.  The 'Ft' option prints a triangulation.  It adds points (the centrums) to non\[hy]simplicial facets.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>v</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Compute the Voronoi diagram from the Delaunay triangulation. The 'p' option prints the Voronoi vertices. The 'o' option prints the Voronoi vertices and the vertices in each Voronoi region.  It lists regions in site ID order. The 'Fv' option prints each ridge of the Voronoi diagram. The first or zero'th vertex indicates the infinity vertex.  Its coordinates are qh_INFINITE (-10.101).  It indicates unbounded Voronoi regions or degenerate Delaunay triangles.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Hn,n,...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Compute halfspace intersection about [n,n,0,...]. The input is a set of halfspaces defined in the same format as 'n', 'Fo', and 'Fi'. Use 'Fp' to print the intersection points.  Use 'Fv' to list the intersection points for each halfspace.  The other output formats display the dual convex hull.</p><p>The point [n,n,n,...] is a feasible point for the halfspaces, i.e., a point that is inside all of the halfspaces (Hx+b &lt;= 0).  The default coordinate value is 0.</p><p>The input may start with a feasible point.  If so, use 'H' by itself. The input starts with a feasible point when the first number is the dimension, the second number is "1", and the coordinates complete a line.  The 'FV' option produces a feasible point for a convex hull.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>d Qu</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Compute the furthest\[hy]site Delaunay triangulation from the upper convex hull.  The 'o' option prints the input points and facets. The 'QJ' option guarantees triangular otuput.  You can also use 'Ft' to triangulate via the centrums of non\[hy]simplicial facets.</p>

  <dt>
    <p>v Qu</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Compute the furthest\[hy]site Voronoi diagram. The 'p' option prints the Voronoi vertices. The 'o' option prints the Voronoi vertices and the vertices in each Voronoi region. The 'Fv' option prints each ridge of the Voronoi diagram. The first or zero'th vertex indicates the infinity vertex at infinity.  Its coordinates are qh_INFINITE (-10.101).  It indicates unbounded Voronoi regions and degenerate Delaunay triangles.</p>

    <p>Input/Output options:</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>f</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Print out all facets and all fields of each facet.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>G</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Output the hull in Geomview format.  For imprecise hulls, Geomview displays the inner and outer hull.  Geomview can also display points, ridges, vertices, coplanar points, and facet intersections.  See below for a list of options.</p><p>For Delaunay triangulations, 'G' displays the corresponding paraboloid.  For halfspace intersection, 'G' displays the dual polytope.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>i</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Output the incident vertices for each facet. Qhull prints the number of facets followed by the vertices of each facet.  One facet is printed per line.  The numbers are the 0\[hy]relative indices of the corresponding input points. The facets are oriented.</p><p>In 4d and higher, Qhull triangulates non\[hy]simplicial facets.  Each apex (the first vertex) is a created point that corresponds to the facet's centrum.  Its index is greater than the indices of the input points.  Each base corresponds to a simplicial ridge between two facets. To print the vertices without triangulation, use option 'Fv'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>m</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Output the hull in Mathematica format.  Qhull writes a Mathematica file for 2\[hy]d and 3\[hy]d convex hulls and for 2\[hy]d Delaunay triangulations.   Qhull produces a list of objects that you can assign to a variable in Mathematica, for example: "list= &lt;&lt; &lt;outputfilename&gt; ". If the object is 2\[hy]d, it can be visualized by "Show[Graphics[list]] ". For 3\[hy]d objects the command is "Show[Graphics3D[list]]".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>n</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Output the normal equation for each facet. Qhull prints the dimension (plus one), the number of facets, and the normals for each facet.  The facet's offset follows its normal coefficients.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>o</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Output the facets in OFF file format. Qhull prints the dimension, number of points, number of facets, and number of ridges.  Then it prints the coordinates of the input points and the vertices for each facet.  Each facet is on a separate line.  The first number is the number of vertices.  The remainder are the indices of the corresponding points.  The vertices are oriented in 2\[hy]d, 3\[hy]d, and in simplicial facets.</p><p>For 2\[hy]d Voronoi diagrams, the vertices are sorted by adjacency, but not oriented.  In 3\[hy]d and higher, the Voronoi vertices are sorted by index. See the 'v' option for more information.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>p</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Output the coordinates of each vertex point. Qhull prints the dimension, the number of points, and the coordinates for each vertex. With the 'Gc' and 'Gi' options, it also prints coplanar and interior points.  For Voronoi diagrams, it prints the coordinates of each Voronoi vertex.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>s</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Print a summary to stderr.  If no output options are specified at all, a summary goes to stdout.  The summary lists the number of input points, the dimension, the number of vertices in the convex hull, the number of facets in the convex hull, the number of good facets (if 'Pg'), and statistics.</p><p>The last two statistics (if needed) measure the maximum distance from a point or vertex to a facet.  The number in parenthesis (e.g., 2.1x) is the ratio between the maximum distance and the worst\[hy]case distance due to merging two simplicial facets.</p>

    <p>An</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Maximum angle given as a cosine.  If the angle between a pair of facet normals is greater than n, Qhull merges one of the facets into a neighbor. If 'n' is negative, Qhull tests angles after adding each point to the hull (pre\[hy]merging). If 'n' is positive, Qhull tests angles after constructing the hull (post\[hy]merging). Both pre\[hy] and post\[hy]merging can be defined.</p><p>Option 'C0' or 'C-0' is set if the corresponding 'Cn' or 'C-n' is not set.  If 'Qx' is set, then 'A-n' and 'C-n' are checked after the hull is constructed and before 'An' and 'Cn' are checked.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Cn</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Centrum radius. If a centrum is less than n below a neighboring facet, Qhull merges one of the facets. If 'n' is negative or '-0', Qhull tests and merges facets after adding each point to the hull.  This is called "pre\[hy]merging".  If 'n' is positive, Qhull tests for convexity after constructing the hull ("post\[hy]merging"). Both pre\[hy] and post\[hy]merging can be defined.</p><p>For 5\[hy]d and higher, 'Qx' should be used instead of 'C-n'.  Otherwise, most or all facets may be merged together.</p>

    <p>Rn</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Randomly perturb distance computations up to +/- n * max_coord. This option perturbs every distance, hyperplane, and angle computation. To use time as the random number seed, use option 'QR-1'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Vn</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Minimum distance for a facet to be visible. A facet is visible if the distance from the point to the facet is greater than 'Vn'.</p><p>Without merging, the default value for 'Vn' is the round\[hy]off error ('En'). With merging, the default value is the pre\[hy]merge centrum ('C-n') in 2\[hy]d or 3\[hy]d, or three times that in other dimensions.  If the outside width is specified ('Wn'), the maximum, default value for 'Vn' is 'Wn'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Un</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Maximum distance below a facet for a point to be coplanar to the facet.  The default value is 'Vn'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Wn</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Minimum outside width of the hull.  Points are added to the convex hull only if they are clearly outside of a facet.  A point is outside of a facet if its distance to the facet is greater than 'Wn'.  The normal value for 'Wn' is 'En'.  If the user specifies pre\[hy]merging and does not set 'Wn', than 'Wn' is set to the premerge 'Cn' and maxcoord*(1-An).</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Verify the convex hull.  This checks the topological structure, facet convexity, and point inclusion. If precision problems occurred, facet convexity is tested whether or not 'Tv' is selected. Option 'Tv' does not check point inclusion if forcing output with 'Po', or if 'Q5' is set.</p><p>For point inclusion testing, Qhull verifies that all points are below all outer planes (facet-&gt;maxoutside).  Point inclusion is exhaustive if merging or if the facet\[hy]point product is small enough; otherwise Qhull verifies each point with a directed search (qh_findbest).</p><p>Point inclusion testing occurs after producing output.  It prints a message to stderr unless option 'Pp' is used.  This allows the user to interrupt Qhull without changing the output.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Please report bugs to Brad Barber at qhull_bug@qhull.org.</p><p>If Qhull does not compile, it is due to an incompatibility between your system and ours.  The first thing to check is that your compiler is ANSI standard.  If it is, check the man page for the best options, or find someone to help you.  If you locate the cause of your problem, please send email since it might help others.</p><p>If Qhull compiles but crashes on the test case (rbox D4), there's still incompatibility between your system and ours.  Typically it's been due to mem.c and memory alignment.  You can use qh_NOmem in mem.h to turn off memory management.  Please let us know if you figure out how to fix these problems.</p><p>If you do find a problem, try to simplify it before reporting the error.  Try different size inputs to locate the smallest one that causes an error.  You're welcome to hunt through the code using the execution trace as a guide.  This is especially true if you're incorporating Qhull into your own program.</p><p>When you do report an error, please attach a data set to the end of your message.  This allows us to see the error for ourselves. Qhull is maintained part\[hy]time.</p>
