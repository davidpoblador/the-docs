      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Some shell builtin commands take options as described in individual entries; these are often referred to in the list below as `<strong>flags</strong>' to avoid confusion with shell options, which may also have an effect on the behaviour of builtin commands.  In this introductory section, `<strong>option</strong>' always has the meaning of an option to a command that should be familiar to most command line users.</p><p>Typically, options are single letters preceded by a hyphen (<strong>-</strong>). Options that take an argument accept it either immediately following the option letter or after white space, for example `<strong>print -C3 *</strong>' or `<strong>print -C 3 *</strong>' are equivalent.  Arguments to options are not the same as arguments to the command; the documentation indicates which is which.  Options that do not take an argument may be combined in a single word, for example `<strong>print -ca *</strong>' and `<strong>print -c -a *</strong>' are equivalent.</p><p>Some shell builtin commands also take options that begin with `<strong>+</strong>' instead of `<strong>-</strong>'.  The list below makes clear which commands these are.</p><p>Options (together with their individual arguments, if any) must appear in a group before any non-option arguments; once the first non-option argument has been found, option processing is terminated.</p><p>All builtin commands other than precommand modifiers, even those that have no options, can be given the argument `<strong>--</strong>' to terminate option processing.  This indicates that the following words are non-option arguments, but is otherwise ignored.  This is useful in cases where arguments to the command may begin with `<strong>-</strong>'.  For historical reasons, most builtin commands also recognize a single `<strong>-</strong>' in a separate word for this purpose; note that this is less standard and use of `<strong>--</strong> is recommended.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-</strong> <em>simple command</em></p>

  <dd>
    <p>See the section `Precommand Modifiers'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>.</strong> <em>file</em> [ <em>arg</em> ... ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Read commands from <em>file</em> and execute them in the current shell environment.</p><p>If <em>file</em> does not contain a slash, or if <strong>PATH_DIRS</strong> is set, the shell looks in the components of <strong>$path</strong> to find the directory containing <em>file</em>.  Files in the current directory are not read unless `<strong>.</strong>' appears somewhere in <strong>$path</strong>.  If a file named `<em>file</em><strong>.zwc</strong>' is found, is newer than <em>file</em>, and is the compiled form (created with the <strong>zcompile</strong> builtin) of <em>file</em>, then commands are read from that file instead of <em>file</em>.</p><p>If any arguments <em>arg</em> are given, they become the positional parameters; the old positional parameters are restored when the <em>file</em> is done executing. If <em>file</em> was not found the return status is 127; if <em>file</em> was found but contained a syntax error the return status is 126; else the return status is the exit status of the last command executed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>:</strong> [ <em>arg</em> ... ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This command does nothing, although normal argument expansions is performed which may have effects on shell parameters.  A zero exit status is returned.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>alias</strong> [ {<strong>+|</strong><strong>-</strong><strong></strong><strong>}</strong><strong>gmrsL</strong><strong> ] [ </strong><em>name</em><strong>[</strong><strong>=</strong><strong></strong><em>value</em><strong>] ... ]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>For each <em>name</em> with a corresponding <em>value</em>, define an alias with that value.  A trailing space in <em>value</em> causes the next word to be checked for alias expansion.  If the <strong>-g</strong> flag is present, define a global alias; global aliases are expanded even if they do not occur in command position.</p><p>If the <strong>-s</strong> flag is present, define a suffix alias: if the command word on a command line is in the form `<em>text</em><strong>.</strong><em>name</em>', where <em>text</em> is any non-empty string, it is replaced by the text `<em>value</em> <em>text</em><strong>.</strong><em>name</em>'.  Note that <em>name</em> is treated as a literal string, not a pattern.  A trailing space in <em>value</em> is not special in this case.  For example,</p>
<pre>
<strong>alias -s ps=gv</strong>
</pre>
<p>will cause the command `<strong>*.ps</strong>' to be expanded to `<strong>gv *.ps</strong>'.  As alias expansion is carried out earlier than globbing, the `<strong>*.ps</strong>' will then be expanded.  Suffix aliases constitute a different name space from other aliases (so in the above example it is still possible to create an alias for the command <strong>ps</strong>) and the two sets are never listed together.</p><p>For each <em>name</em> with no <em>value</em>, print the value of <em>name</em>, if any.  With no arguments, print all currently defined aliases other than suffix aliases.  If the <strong>-m</strong> flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns (they should be quoted to preserve them from being interpreted as glob patterns), and the aliases matching these patterns are printed.  When printing aliases and one of the <strong>-g</strong>, <strong>-r</strong> or <strong>-s</strong> flags is present, restrict the printing to global, regular or suffix aliases, respectively; a regular alias is one which is neither a global nor a suffix alias.   Using `<strong>+</strong>' instead of `<strong>-</strong>', or ending the option list with a single `<strong>+</strong>', prevents the values of the aliases from being printed.</p><p>If the <strong>-L</strong> flag is present, then print each alias in a manner suitable for putting in a startup script.  The exit status is nonzero if a <em>name</em> (with no <em>value</em>) is given for which no alias has been defined.</p><p>For more on aliases, include common problems, see the section ALIASING in <a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html"><strong>zshmisc</strong>(1)</a>.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>autoload</strong> [ {<strong>+</strong>|<strong>-</strong>}<strong>UXkmtz</strong> ] [ <strong>-w</strong> ] [ <em>name</em> ... ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Equivalent to <strong>functions -u</strong>, with the exception of <strong>-X</strong>/<strong>+X</strong> and <strong>-w</strong>.</p><p>The flag <strong>-X</strong> may be used only inside a shell function, and may not be followed by a <em>name</em>.  It causes the calling function to be marked for autoloading and then immediately loaded and executed, with the current array of positional parameters as arguments.  This replaces the previous definition of the function.  If no function definition is found, an error is printed and the function remains undefined and marked for autoloading.</p><p>The flag <strong>+X</strong> attempts to load each <em>name</em> as an autoloaded function, but does <em>not</em> execute it.  The exit status is zero (success) if the function was not previously defined <em>and</em> a definition for it was found. This does <em>not</em> replace any existing definition of the function.  The exit status is nonzero (failure) if the function was already defined or when no definition was found.  In the latter case the function remains undefined and marked for autoloading.  If ksh-style autoloading is enabled, the function created will contain the contents of the file plus a call to the function itself appended to it, thus giving normal ksh autoloading behaviour on the first call to the function. If the <strong>-m</strong> flag is also given each <em>name</em> is treated as a pattern and all functions already marked for autoload that match the pattern are loaded.</p><p>With the <strong>-w</strong> flag, the <em>name</em>s are taken as names of files compiled with the <strong>zcompile</strong> builtin, and all functions defined in them are marked for autoloading.</p><p>The flags <strong>-z</strong> and <strong>-k</strong> mark the function to be autoloaded using the zsh or ksh style, as if the option <strong>KSH_AUTOLOAD</strong> were unset or were set, respectively.  The flags override the setting of the option at the time the function is loaded.</p><p>Note that the <strong>autoload</strong> command makes no attempt to ensure the shell options set during the loading or execution of the file have any particular value.  For this, the <strong>emulate</strong> command can be used:</p>
<pre>
<strong>emulate zsh -c 'autoload -Uz </strong><em>func</em><strong>'</strong><em></em>
</pre>
<p>arranges that when <em>func</em> is loaded the shell is in native <strong>zsh</strong> emulation, and this emulation is also applied when <em>func</em> is run.</p>

    <p>Change the current directory.  In the first form, change the current directory to <em>arg</em>, or to the value of <strong>$HOME</strong> if <em>arg</em> is not specified.  If <em>arg</em> is `<strong>-</strong>', change to the previous directory.</p><p>Otherwise, if <em>arg</em> begins with a slash, attempt to change to the directory given by <em>arg</em>.</p><p>If <em>arg</em> does not begin with a slash, the behaviour depends on whether the current directory `<strong>.</strong>' occurs in the list of directories contained in the shell parameter <strong>cdpath</strong>.  If it does not, first attempt to change to the directory <em>arg</em> under the current directory, and if that fails but <strong>cdpath</strong> is set and contains at least one element attempt to change to the directory <em>arg</em> under each component of <strong>cdpath</strong> in turn until successful.  If `<strong>.</strong>' occurs in <strong>cdpath</strong>, then <strong>cdpath</strong> is searched strictly in order so that `<strong>.</strong>' is only tried at the appropriate point.</p><p>The order of testing <strong>cdpath</strong> is modified if the option <strong>POSIX_CD</strong> is set, as described in the documentation for the option.</p><p>If no directory is found, the option <strong>CDABLE_VARS</strong> is set, and a parameter named <em>arg</em> exists whose value begins with a slash, treat its value as the directory.  In that case, the parameter is added to the named directory hash table.</p><p>The second form of <strong>cd</strong> substitutes the string <em>new</em> for the string <em>old</em> in the name of the current directory, and tries to change to this new directory.</p><p>The third form of <strong>cd</strong> extracts an entry from the directory stack, and changes to that directory.  An argument of the form `<strong>+</strong><em>n</em>' identifies a stack entry by counting from the left of the list shown by the <strong>dirs</strong> command, starting with zero. An argument of the form `<strong>-</strong><em>n</em>' counts from the right. If the <strong>PUSHD_MINUS</strong> option is set, the meanings of `<strong>+</strong>' and `<strong>-</strong>' in this context are swapped.</p><p>If the <strong>-q</strong> (quiet) option is specified, the hook function <strong>chpwd</strong> and the functions in the array <strong>chpwd_functions</strong> are not called. This is useful for calls to <strong>cd</strong> that do not change the environment seen by an interactive user.</p><p>If the <strong>-s</strong> option is specified, <strong>cd</strong> refuses to change the current directory if the given pathname contains symlinks.  If the <strong>-P</strong> option is given or the <strong>CHASE_LINKS</strong> option is set, symbolic links are resolved to their true values.  If the <strong>-L</strong> option is given symbolic links are retained in the directory (and not resolved) regardless of the state of the <strong>CHASE_LINKS</strong> option.</p>

    <p>The simple command argument is taken as an external command instead of a function or builtin and is executed. If the <strong>POSIX_BUILTINS</strong> option is set, builtins will also be executed but certain special properties of them are suppressed. The <strong>-p</strong> flag causes a default path to be searched instead of that in <strong>$path</strong>. With the <strong>-v</strong> flag, <strong>command</strong> is similar to <strong>whence</strong> and with <strong>-V</strong>, it is equivalent to <strong>whence</strong> -v.</p><p>See also the section `Precommand Modifiers'.</p>

    <p>Temporarily disable the <em>name</em>d hash table elements or patterns.  The default is to disable builtin commands.  This allows you to use an external command with the same name as a builtin command.  The <strong>-a</strong> option causes <strong>disable</strong> to act on regular or global aliases.  The <strong>-s</strong> option causes <strong>disable</strong> to act on suffix aliases.  The <strong>-f</strong> option causes <strong>disable</strong> to act on shell functions.  The <strong>-r</strong> options causes <strong>disable</strong> to act on reserved words.  Without arguments all disabled hash table elements from the corresponding hash table are printed. With the <strong>-m</strong> flag the arguments are taken as patterns (which should be quoted to prevent them from undergoing filename expansion), and all hash table elements from the corresponding hash table matching these patterns are disabled.  Disabled objects can be enabled with the <strong>enable</strong> command.</p><p>With the option <strong>-p</strong>, <em>name</em> ... refer to elements of the shell's pattern syntax as described in the section `Filename Generation'. Certain elements can be disabled separately, as given below.</p><p>Note that patterns not allowed by the current settings for the options <strong>EXTENDED_GLOB</strong>, <strong>KSH_GLOB</strong> and <strong>SH_GLOB</strong> are never enabled, regardless of the setting here.  For example, if <strong>EXTENDED_GLOB</strong> is not active, the pattern <strong>^</strong> is ineffective even if `<strong>disable -p "^"</strong>' has not been issued.  The list below indicates any option settings that restrict the use of the pattern.  It should be noted that setting <strong>SH_GLOB</strong> has a wider effect then merely disabling patterns as certain expressions, in particular those involving parentheses, are parsed differently.</p><p>The following patterns may be disabled; all the strings need quoting on the command line to prevent them from being interpreted immediately as patterns and the patterns are shown below in single quotes as a reminder.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Without any argument print current emulation mode.</p><p>With single argument set up zsh options to emulate the specified shell as much as possible. <strong>csh</strong> will never be fully emulated. If the argument is not one of the shells listed above, <strong>zsh</strong> will be used as a default; more precisely, the tests performed on the argument are the same as those used to determine the emulation at startup based on the shell name, see the section COMPATIBILITY in <a href="../man1/zsh.1.html"><strong>zsh</strong>(1)</a> .  In addition to setting shell options, the command also restores the pristine state of pattern enables, as if all patterns had been enabled using <strong>enable -p</strong>.</p><p>If the <strong>emulate</strong> command occurs inside a function that has been marked for execution tracing with <strong>functions -t</strong> then the <strong>xtrace</strong> option will be turned on regardless of emulation mode or other options. Note that code executed inside the function by the <strong>.</strong>, <strong>source</strong>, or <strong>eval</strong> commands is not considered to be running directly from the function, hence does not provoke this behaviour.</p><p>If the <strong>-R</strong> switch is given, all settable options are reset to their default value corresponding to the specified emulation mode, except for certain options describing the interactive environment; otherwise, only those options likely to cause portability problems in scripts and functions are altered.  If the <strong>-L</strong> switch is given, the options <strong>LOCAL_OPTIONS</strong>, <strong>LOCAL_PATTERNS</strong> and <strong>LOCAL_TRAPS</strong> will be set as well, causing the effects of the <strong>emulate</strong> command and any <strong>setopt</strong>, <strong>disable -p</strong> or <strong>enable -p</strong>, and <strong>trap</strong> commands to be local to the immediately surrounding shell function, if any; normally these options are turned off in all emulation modes except <strong>ksh</strong>. The <strong>-L</strong> switch is mutually exclusive with the use of <strong>-c</strong> in <em>flags</em>.</p><p>The <em>flags</em> may be any of the invocation-time flags described in the section INVOCATION in <a href="../man1/zsh.1.html"><strong>zsh</strong>(1)</a>, except that `<strong>-o EMACS</strong>' and `<strong>-o VI</strong>' may not be used.  Flags such as `<strong>+r</strong>'/`<strong>+o RESTRICTED</strong>' may be prohibited in some circumstances.</p><p>If <strong>-c</strong> <em>arg</em> appears in <em>flags</em>, <em>arg</em> is evaluated while the requested emulation is temporarily in effect.  In this case the emulation mode and all options are restored to their previous values before <strong>emulate</strong> returns.  The <strong>-R</strong> switch may precede the name of the shell to emulate; note this has a meaning distinct from including <strong>-R</strong> in <em>flags</em>.</p><p>Use of <strong>-c</strong> enables `sticky' emulation mode for functions defined within the evaluated expression:  the emulation mode is associated thereafter with the function so that whenever the function is executed the emulation (respecting the <strong>-R</strong> switch, if present) and all options are set (and pattern disables cleared) before entry to the function, and the state is restored after exit. If the function is called when the sticky emulation is already in effect, either within an `<strong>emulate</strong> <em>shell</em> <strong>-c</strong>' expression or within another function with the same sticky emulation, entry and exit from the function do not cause options to be altered (except due to standard processing such as the <strong>LOCAL_OPTIONS</strong> option).  This also applies to functions marked for autoload within the sticky emulation; the appropriate set of options will be applied at the point the function is loaded as well as when it is run.</p><p>For example:</p>
<pre>
<strong>emulate sh -c 'fni() { setopt cshnullglob; }</strong>
fno() { fni; }'
fno

</pre>
<p>The two functions <strong>fni</strong> and <strong>fno</strong> are defined with sticky <strong>sh</strong> emulation.  <strong>fno</strong> is then executed, causing options associated with emulations to be set to their values in <strong>sh</strong>.  <strong>fni</strong> then calls <strong>fno</strong>; because <strong>fno</strong> is also marked for sticky <strong>sh</strong> emulation, no option changes take place on entry to or exit from it. Hence the option <strong>cshnullglob</strong>, turned off by <strong>sh</strong> emulation, will be turned on within <strong>fni</strong> and remain on on return to <strong>fno</strong>.  On exit from <strong>fno</strong>, the emulation mode and all options will be restored to the state they were in before entry to the temporary emulation.</p><p>The documentation above is typically sufficient for the intended purpose of executing code designed for other shells in a suitable environment.  More detailed rules follow.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>1.</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The sticky emulation environment provided by `<strong>emulate</strong> <em>shell</em> <strong>-c</strong>' is identical to that provided by entry to a function marked for sticky emulation as a consequence of being defined in such an environment.  Hence, for example, the sticky emulation is inherited by subfunctions defined within functions with sticky emulation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>2.</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>No change of options takes place on entry to or exit from functions that are not marked for sticky emulation, other than those that would normally take place, even if those functions are called within sticky emulation.</p>

    <p>3.</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>No special handling is provided for functions marked for <strong>autoload</strong> nor for functions present in wordcode created by the <strong>zcompile</strong> command.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>4.</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The presence or absence of the <strong>-R</strong> switch to <strong>emulate</strong> corresponds to different sticky emulation modes, so for example `<strong>emulate sh -c</strong>', `<strong>emulate -R sh -c</strong>' and `<strong>emulate csh -c</strong>' are treated as three distinct sticky emulations.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>5.</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Difference in shell options supplied in addition to the basic emulation also mean the sticky emulations are different, so for example `<strong>emulate zsh -c</strong>' and `<strong>emulate zsh -o cbases -c</strong>' are treated as distinct sticky emulations.</p>

If the <strong>-a</strong> option is also specified, this history list will be automatically popped when the current function scope is exited, which is a much better solution than creating a trap function to call `<strong>fc -P</strong>' manually.  If no arguments are specified, the history list is left empty, <strong>$HISTFILE</strong> is unset, and <strong>$HISTSIZE</strong> & <strong>$SAVEHIST</strong> are set to their default values.  If one argument is given, <strong>$HISTFILE</strong> is set to that filename, <strong>$HISTSIZE</strong> & <strong>$SAVEHIST</strong> are left unchanged, and the history file is read in (if it exists) to initialize the new list.  If a second argument is specified, <strong>$HISTSIZE</strong> & <strong>$SAVEHIST</strong> are instead set to the single specified numeric value.  Finally, if a third argument is specified, <strong>$SAVEHIST</strong> is set to a separate value from <strong>$HISTSIZE</strong>.  You are free to change these environment values for the new history list however you desire in order to manipulate the new history list.</p><p>`<strong>fc -P</strong>' pops the history list back to an older list saved by `<strong>fc -p</strong>'. The current list is saved to its <strong>$HISTFILE</strong> before it is destroyed (assuming that <strong>$HISTFILE</strong> and <strong>$SAVEHIST</strong> are set appropriately, of course).  The values of <strong>$HISTFILE</strong>, <strong>$HISTSIZE</strong>, and <strong>$SAVEHIST</strong> are restored to the values they had when `<strong>fc -p</strong>' was called.  Note that this restoration can conflict with making these variables "local", so your best bet is to avoid local declarations for these variables in functions that use `<strong>fc -p</strong>'.  The one other guaranteed-safe combination is declaring these variables to be local at the top of your function and using the automatic option (<strong>-a</strong>) with `<strong>fc -p</strong>'.  Finally, note that it is legal to manually pop a push marked for automatic popping if you need to do so before the function exits.</p><p>`<strong>fc -R</strong>' reads the history from the given file, `<strong>fc -W</strong>' writes the history out to the given file, and `<strong>fc -A</strong>' appends the history out to the given file. If no filename is specified, the <strong>$HISTFILE</strong> is assumed. If the <strong>-I</strong> option is added to <strong>-R</strong>, only those events that are not already contained within the internal history list are added. If the <strong>-I</strong> option is added to <strong>-A</strong> or <strong>-W</strong>, only those events that are new since last incremental append/write to the history file are appended/written. In any case, the created file will have no more than <strong>$SAVEHIST</strong> entries.</p>

The result of the last arithmetical expression evaluated inside the shell function (even if it is a form that normally only returns a status) gives the result of the mathematical function.</p><p><strong>functions -M</strong> with no arguments lists all such user-defined functions in the same form as a definition.  With the additional option <strong>-m</strong> and a list of arguments, all functions whose <em>mathfn</em> matches one of the pattern arguments are listed.</p><p><strong>function +M</strong> removes the list of mathematical functions; with the additional option <strong>-m</strong> the arguments are treated as patterns and all functions whose <strong>mathfn</strong> matches the pattern are removed.  Note that the shell function implementing the behaviour is not removed (regardless of whether its name coincides with <strong>mathfn</strong>).</p><p>For example, the following prints the cube of 3:</p>
<pre>
<strong>zmath_cube() { (( $1 * $1 * $1 )) }</strong>
functions -M cube 1 1 zmath_cube
print $(( <strong>cube</strong>(3) ))

  <dd>
    <p>Checks the <em>arg</em>s for legal options.  If the <em>arg</em>s are omitted, use the positional parameters.  A valid option argument begins with a `<strong>+</strong>' or a `<strong>-</strong>'.  An argument not beginning with a `<strong>+</strong>' or a `<strong>-</strong>', or the argument `<strong>-</strong><strong>-</strong>', ends the options. Note that a single `<strong>-</strong>' is not considered a valid option argument. <em>optstring</em> contains the letters that <strong>getopts</strong> recognizes.  If a letter is followed by a `<strong>:</strong>', that option requires an argument.  The options can be separated from the argument by blanks.</p><p>Each time it is invoked, <strong>getopts</strong> places the option letter it finds in the shell parameter <em>name</em>, prepended with a `<strong>+</strong>' when <em>arg</em> begins with a `<strong>+</strong>'.  The index of the next <em>arg</em> is stored in <strong>OPTIND</strong>.  The option argument, if any, is stored in <strong>OPTARG</strong>.</p><p>The first option to be examined may be changed by explicitly assigning to <strong>OPTIND</strong>.  <strong>OPTIND</strong> has an initial value of <strong>1</strong>, and is normally reset to <strong>1</strong> upon exit from a shell function.  <strong>OPTARG</strong> is not reset and retains its value from the most recent call to <strong>getopts</strong>.  If either of <strong>OPTIND</strong> or <strong>OPTARG</strong> is explicitly unset, it remains unset, and the index or option argument is not stored.  The option itself is still stored in <em>name</em> in this case.</p><p>A leading `<strong>:</strong>' in <em>optstring</em> causes <strong>getopts</strong> to store the letter of any invalid option in <strong>OPTARG</strong>, and to set <em>name</em> to `<strong>?</strong>' for an unknown option and to `<strong>:</strong>' when a required argument is missing.  Otherwise, <strong>getopts</strong> sets <em>name</em> to `<strong>?</strong>' and prints an error message when an option is invalid.  The exit status is nonzero when there are no more options.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>hash</strong> can be used to directly modify the contents of the command hash table, and the named directory hash table.  Normally one would modify these tables by modifying one's <strong>PATH</strong> (for the command hash table) or by creating appropriate shell parameters (for the named directory hash table). The choice of hash table to work on is determined by the <strong>-d</strong> option; without the option the command hash table is used, and with the option the named directory hash table is used.</p><p>Given no arguments, and neither the <strong>-r</strong> or <strong>-f</strong> options, the selected hash table will be listed in full.</p><p>The <strong>-r</strong> option causes the selected hash table to be emptied. It will be subsequently rebuilt in the normal fashion. The <strong>-f</strong> option causes the selected hash table to be fully rebuilt immediately.  For the command hash table this hashes all the absolute directories in the <strong>PATH</strong>, and for the named directory hash table this adds all users' home directories. These two options cannot be used with any arguments.</p><p>The <strong>-m</strong> option causes the arguments to be taken as patterns (which should be quoted) and the elements of the hash table matching those patterns are printed.  This is the only way to display a limited selection of hash table elements.</p><p>For each <em>name</em> with a corresponding <em>value</em>, put `<em>name</em>' in the selected hash table, associating it with the pathname `<em>value</em>'. In the command hash table, this means that whenever `<em>name</em>' is used as a command argument, the shell will try to execute the file given by `<em>value</em>'. In the named directory hash table, this means that `<em>value</em>' may be referred to as `<strong>~</strong><em>name</em>'.</p><p>For each <em>name</em> with no corresponding <em>value</em>, attempt to add <em>name</em> to the hash table, checking what the appropriate <strong>value</strong> is in the normal manner for that hash table.  If an appropriate <strong>value</strong> can't be found, then the hash table will be unchanged.</p><p>The <strong>-v</strong> option causes hash table entries to be listed as they are added by explicit specification.  If has no effect if used with <strong>-f</strong>.</p><p>If the <strong>-L</strong> flag is present, then each hash table entry is printed in the form of a call to hash.</p>

If the signal being sent is not `<strong>KILL</strong>' or `<strong>CONT</strong>', then the job will be sent a `<strong>CONT</strong>' signal if it is stopped. The argument <em>job</em> can be the process ID of a job not in the job list. In the second form, <strong>kill -l</strong>, if <em>sig</em> is not specified the signal names are listed.  Otherwise, for each <em>sig</em> that is a name, the corresponding signal number is listed.  For each <em>sig</em> that is a signal number or a number representing the exit status of a process which was terminated or stopped by a signal the name of the signal is printed.</p><p>On some systems, alternative signal names are allowed for a few signals. Typical examples are <strong>SIGCHLD</strong> and <strong>SIGCLD</strong> or <strong>SIGPOLL</strong> and <strong>SIGIO</strong>, assuming they correspond to the same signal number.  <strong>kill</strong> -l will only list the preferred form, however <strong>kill -l</strong> <em>alt</em> will show if the alternative form corresponds to a signal number.  For example, under Linux <strong>kill -l IO</strong> and <strong>kill -l POLL</strong> both output 29, hence <strong>kill -IO</strong> and <strong>kill -POLL</strong> have the same effect.</p><p>Many systems will allow process IDs to be negative to kill a process group or zero to kill the current process group.</p>

    <p>Print the arguments according to the format specification. Formatting rules are the same as used in C. The same escape sequences as for <strong>echo</strong> are recognised in the format. All C conversion specifications ending in one of csdiouxXeEfgGn are handled. In addition to this, `<strong>%b</strong>' can be used instead of `<strong>%s</strong>' to cause escape sequences in the argument to be recognised and `<strong>%q</strong>' can be used to quote the argument in such a way that allows it to be reused as shell input. With the numeric format specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a quote character, the numeric value of the following character is used as the number to print otherwise the argument is evaluated as an arithmetic expression. See the section `Arithmetic Evaluation' in <a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html"><strong>zshmisc</strong>(1)</a> for a description of arithmetic expressions. With `<strong>%n</strong>', the corresponding argument is taken as an identifier which is created as an integer parameter.</p><p>Normally, conversion specifications are applied to each argument in order but they can explicitly specify the <em>n</em>th argument is to be used by replacing `<strong>%</strong>' by `<strong>%</strong><em>n</em><strong>$</strong>' and `<strong>*</strong>' by `<strong>*</strong><em>n</em><strong>$</strong>'. It is recommended that you do not mix references of this explicit style with the normal style and the handling of such mixed styles may be subject to future change.</p><p>If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format string is reused until all arguments have been consumed. With the <strong>print</strong> builtin, this can be suppressed by using the <strong>-r</strong> option. If more arguments are required by the format than have been specified, the behaviour is as if zero or an empty string had been specified as the argument.</p>

The meaning of <em>old</em> and <em>new</em> in the second form is also the same as for <strong>cd</strong>.</p><p>The third form of <strong>pushd</strong> changes directory by rotating the directory list.  An argument of the form `<strong>+</strong><em>n</em>' identifies a stack entry by counting from the left of the list shown by the <strong>dirs</strong> command, starting with zero.  An argument of the form `<strong>-</strong><em>n</em>' counts from the right.  If the <strong>PUSHD_MINUS</strong> option is set, the meanings of `<strong>+</strong>' and `<strong>-</strong>' in this context are swapped.</p><p>If the <strong>-q</strong> (quiet) option is specified, the hook function <strong>chpwd</strong> and the functions in the array <strong>$chpwd_functions</strong> are not called, and the new directory stack is not printed.  This is useful for calls to <strong>pushd</strong> that do not change the environment seen by an interactive user.</p><p>If the option <strong>-q</strong> is not specified and the shell option <strong>PUSHD_SILENT</strong> is not set, the directory stack will be printed after a <strong>pushd</strong> is performed.</p><p>The options <strong>-s</strong>, <strong>-L</strong> and <strong>-P</strong> have the same meanings as for the <strong>cd</strong> builtin.</p>

Options that are on by default for the emulation are shown with the prefix <strong>no</strong> only if they are off, while other options are shown without the prefix <strong>no</strong> and only if they are on.  In addition to options changed from the default state by the user, any options activated automatically by the shell (for example, <strong>SHIN_STDIN</strong> or <strong>INTERACTIVE</strong>) will be shown in the list.  The format is further modified by the option <strong>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</strong>, however the rationale for choosing options with or without the <strong>no</strong> prefix remains the same in this case.</p><p>If the <strong>-m</strong> flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns (which should be quoted to protect them from filename expansion), and all options with names matching these patterns are set.</p><p>Note that a bad option name does not cause execution of subsequent shell code to be aborted; this is behaviour is different from that of `<strong>set</strong> -o'.

    <p>Like the system version of <strong>test</strong>.  Added for compatibility; use conditional expressions instead (see the section `Conditional Expressions').

Unfortunately there are intrinsic ambiguities in the syntax; in particular there is no distinction between test operators and strings that resemble them.  The standard attempts to resolve these for small numbers of arguments (up to four); for five or more arguments compatibility cannot be relied on.  Users are urged wherever possible to use the `<strong>[[</strong>' test syntax which does not have these ambiguities.</p>

    <p><strong>trap</strong> [ <em>arg</em> ] [ <em>sig</em> ... ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>arg</em> is a series of commands (usually quoted to protect it from immediate evaluation by the shell) to be read and executed when the shell receives any of the signals specified by one or more <em>sig</em> args. Each <em>sig</em> can be given as a number, or as the name of a signal either with or without the string <strong>SIG</strong> in front (e.g. 1, HUP, and SIGHUP are all the same signal).</p><p>If <em>arg</em> is `<strong>-</strong>', then the specified signals are reset to their defaults, or, if no <em>sig</em> args are present, all traps are reset.</p><p>If <em>arg</em> is an empty string, then the specified signals are ignored by the shell (and by the commands it invokes).</p><p>If <em>arg</em> is omitted but one or more <em>sig</em> args are provided (i.e. the first argument is a valid signal number or name), the effect is the same as if <em>arg</em> had been specified as `<strong>-</strong>'.</p><p>The <strong>trap</strong> command with no arguments prints a list of commands associated with each signal.</p><p>If <em>sig</em> is <strong>ZERR</strong> then <em>arg</em> will be executed after each command with a nonzero exit status.  <strong>ERR</strong> is an alias for <strong>ZERR</strong> on systems that have no <strong>SIGERR</strong> signal (this is the usual case).</p><p>If <em>sig</em> is <strong>DEBUG</strong> then <em>arg</em> will be executed before each command if the option <strong>DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD</strong> is set (as it is by default), else after each command.  Here, a `command' is what is described as a `sublist' in the shell grammar, see the section SIMPLE COMMANDS & PIPELINES in <a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html"><strong>zshmisc</strong>(1)</a>. If <strong>DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD</strong> is set various additional features are available. First, it is possible to skip the next command by setting the option <strong>ERR_EXIT</strong>; see the description of the <strong>ERR_EXIT</strong> option in <a href="../man1/zshoptions.1.html"><strong>zshoptions</strong>(1)</a>.  Also, the shell parameter <strong>ZSH_DEBUG_CMD</strong> is set to the string corresponding to the command to be executed following the trap.  Note that this string is reconstructed from the internal format and may not be formatted the same way as the original text.  The parameter is unset after the trap is executed.</p><p>If <em>sig</em> is <strong>0</strong> or <strong>EXIT</strong> and the <strong>trap</strong> statement is executed inside the body of a function, then the command <em>arg</em> is executed after the function completes. The value of <strong>$?</strong> at the start of execution is the exit status of the shell or the return status of the function exiting. If <em>sig</em> is <strong>0</strong> or <strong>EXIT</strong> and the <strong>trap</strong> statement is not executed inside the body of a function, then the command <em>arg</em> is executed when the shell terminates; the trap runs before any <strong>zshexit</strong> hook functions.</p><p><strong>ZERR</strong>, <strong>DEBUG</strong>, and <strong>EXIT</strong> traps are not executed inside other traps.  <strong>ZERR</strong> and <strong>DEBUG</strong> traps are kept within subshells, while other traps are reset.</p><p>Note that traps defined with the <strong>trap</strong> builtin are slightly different from those defined as `<strong>TRAP</strong><em>NAL</em> () { ... }', as the latter have their own function environment (line numbers, local variables, etc.) while the former use the environment of the command in which they were called. For example,</p>
<pre>
<strong>trap 'print $LINENO' DEBUG</strong>
</pre>
<p>will print the line number of a command executed after it has run, while</p>
<pre>
<strong>TRAPDEBUG() { print $LINENO; }</strong>
</pre>
<p>will always print the number zero.</p><p>Alternative signal names are allowed as described under <strong>kill</strong> above. Defining a trap under either name causes any trap under an alternative name to be removed.  However, it is recommended that for consistency users stick exclusively to one name or another.</p>

    <p>The <strong>-f</strong> option freezes the tty (i.e. terminal or terminal emulator), and <strong>-u</strong> unfreezes it. When the tty is frozen, no changes made to the tty settings by external programs will be honored by the shell, except for changes in the size of the screen; the shell will simply reset the settings to their previous values as soon as each command exits or is suspended.  Thus, <strong>stty</strong> and similar programs have no effect when the tty is frozen.  Freezing the tty does not cause the current state to be remembered: instead, it causes future changes to the state to be blocked.</p><p>Without options it reports whether the terminal is frozen or not.</p><p>Note that, regardless of whether the tty is frozen or not, the shell needs to change the settings when the line editor starts, so unfreezing the tty does not guarantee settings made on the command line are preserved.  Strings of commands run between editing the command line will see a consistent tty state. See also the shell variable <strong>STTY</strong> for a means of initialising the tty before running external commands.</p>

    <p>Set or display attributes and values for shell parameters.</p><p>A parameter is created for each <em>name</em> that does not already refer to one.  When inside a function, a new parameter is created for every <em>name</em> (even those that already exist), and is unset again when the function completes.  See `Local Parameters' in <a href="../man1/zshparam.1.html"><strong>zshparam</strong>(1)</a>.  The same rules apply to special shell parameters, which retain their special attributes when made local.</p><p>For each <em>name</em><strong>=</strong><em>value</em> assignment, the parameter <em>name</em> is set to <em>value</em>.  Note that arrays currently cannot be assigned in <strong>typeset</strong> expressions, only scalars and integers.  Unless the option <strong>KSH_TYPESET</strong> is set, normal expansion rules apply to assignment arguments, so <em>value</em> may be split into separate words; if the option is set, assignments which can be recognised when expansion is performed are treated as single words.  For example the command <strong>typeset vbl=$(echo one two)</strong> is treated as having one argument if <strong>KSH_TYPESET</strong> is set, but otherwise is treated as having the two arguments <strong>vbl=one</strong> and <strong>two</strong>.</p><p>If the shell option <strong>TYPESET_SILENT</strong> is not set, for each remaining <em>name</em> that refers to a parameter that is set, the name and value of the parameter are printed in the form of an assignment.  Nothing is printed for newly-created parameters, or when any attribute flags listed below are given along with the <em>name</em>.  Using `<strong>+</strong>' instead of minus to introduce an attribute turns it off.</p><p>If the <strong>-p</strong> option is given, parameters and values are printed in the form of a typeset command and an assignment (which will be printed separately for arrays and associative arrays), regardless of other flags and options.  Note that the <strong>-h</strong> flag on parameters is respected; no value will be shown for these parameters.</p><p>If the <strong>-T</strong> option is given, two or three arguments must be present (an exception is that zero arguments are allowed to show the list of parameters created in this fashion).  The first two are the name of a scalar and an array parameter (in that order) that will be tied together in the manner of <strong>$PATH</strong> and <strong>$path</strong>.  The optional third argument is a single-character separator which will be used to join the elements of the array to form the scalar; if absent, a colon is used, as with <strong>$PATH</strong>.  Only the first character of the separator is significant; any remaining characters are ignored.  Only the scalar parameter may be assigned an initial value.  Both the scalar and the array may otherwise be manipulated as normal.  If one is unset, the other will automatically be unset too.  There is no way of untying the variables without unsetting them, or converting the type of one of them with another <strong>typeset</strong> command; <strong>+T</strong> does not work, assigning an array to <em>SCALAR</em> is an error, and assigning a scalar to <em>array</em> sets it to be a single-element array.  Note that both `<strong>typeset -xT ...</strong>' and `<strong>export -T ...</strong>' work, but only the scalar will be marked for export.  Setting the value using the scalar version causes a split on all separators (which cannot be quoted).  It is possible to use the same two tied variables with a different separator character in which case the variables remain joined as before but the separator is changed. This flag has a different meaning when used with <strong>-f</strong>; see below.</p><p>The <strong>-g</strong> (global) flag is treated specially: it means that any resulting parameter will not be restricted to local scope.  Note that this does not necessarily mean that the parameter will be global, as the flag will apply to any existing parameter (even if unset) from an enclosing function.  This flag does not affect the parameter after creation, hence it has no effect when listing existing parameters, nor does the flag <strong>+g</strong> have any effect except in combination with <strong>-m</strong> (see below).</p><p>If no <em>name</em> is present, the names and values of all parameters are printed.  In this case the attribute flags restrict the display to only those parameters that have the specified attributes, and using `<strong>+</strong>' rather than `<strong>-</strong>' to introduce the flag suppresses printing of the values of parameters when there is no parameter name.  Also, if the last option is the word `<strong>+</strong>', then names are printed but values are not.</p><p>If the <strong>-m</strong> flag is given the <em>name</em> arguments are taken as patterns (which should be quoted).  With no attribute flags, all parameters (or functions with the <strong>-f</strong> flag) with matching names are printed (the shell option <strong>TYPESET_SILENT</strong> is not used in this case).  Note that <strong>-m</strong> is ignored if no patterns are given.  If the <strong>+g</strong> flag is combined with <strong>-m</strong>, a new local parameter is created for every matching parameter that is not already local.  Otherwise <strong>-m</strong> applies all other flags or assignments to the existing parameters.  Except when assignments are made with <em>name</em><strong>=</strong><em>value</em>, using <strong>+m</strong> forces the matching parameters to be printed, even inside a function.</p><p>If no attribute flags are given and either no <strong>-m</strong> flag is present or the <strong>+m</strong> form was used, each parameter name printed is preceded by a list of the attributes of that parameter (<strong>array</strong>, <strong>association</strong>, <strong>exported</strong>, <strong>integer</strong>, <strong>readonly</strong>).  If <strong>+m</strong> is used with attribute flags, and all those flags are introduced with <strong>+</strong>, the matching parameter names are printed but their values are not.</p><p>Attribute flags that transform the final value (<strong>-L</strong>, <strong>-R</strong>, <strong>-Z</strong>, <strong>-l</strong>, <strong>u</strong>) are only applied to the expanded value at the point of a parameter expansion expression using `<strong>$</strong>'.  They are not applied when a parameter is retrieved internally by the shell for any purpose.</p><p>The following attribute flags may be specified:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-A</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The names refer to associative array parameters; see `Array Parameters' in <a href="../man1/zshparam.1.html"><strong>zshparam</strong>(1)</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-L</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Left justify and remove leading blanks from <em>value</em>. If <em>n</em> is nonzero, it defines the width of the field. If <em>n</em> is zero, the width is determined by the width of the value of the first assignment.  In the case of numeric parameters, the length of the complete value assigned to the parameter is used to determine the width, not the value that would be output.</p><p>The width is the count of characters, which may be multibyte characters if the <strong>MULTIBYTE</strong> option is in effect.  Note that the screen width of the character is not taken into account; if this is required, use padding with parameter expansion flags <strong>${(ml</strong><em>...</em><strong>)</strong><em>...</em><strong>}</strong> as described in `Parameter Expansion Flags' in <a href="../man1/zshexpn.1.html"><strong>zshexpn</strong>(1)</a>.</p><p>When the parameter is expanded, it is filled on the right with blanks or truncated if necessary to fit the field. Note truncation can lead to unexpected results with numeric parameters. Leading zeros are removed if the <strong>-Z</strong> flag is also set.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-R</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Similar to <strong>-L</strong>, except that right justification is used; when the parameter is expanded, the field is left filled with blanks or truncated from the end.  May not be combined with the <strong>-Z</strong> flag.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-U</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>For arrays (but not for associative arrays), keep only the first occurrence of each duplicated value.  This may also be set for colon-separated special parameters like <strong>PATH</strong> or <strong>FIGNORE</strong>, etc. This flag has a different meaning when used with <strong>-f</strong>; see below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-Z</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specially handled if set along with the <strong>-L</strong> flag. Otherwise, similar to <strong>-R</strong>, except that leading zeros are used for padding instead of blanks if the first non-blank character is a digit. Numeric parameters are specially handled: they are always eligible for padding with zeroes, and the zeroes are inserted at an appropriate place in the output.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-a</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The names refer to array parameters.  An array parameter may be created this way, but it may not be assigned to in the <strong>typeset</strong> statement.  When displaying, both normal and associative arrays are shown.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-f</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The names refer to functions rather than parameters.  No assignments can be made, and the only other valid flags are <strong>-t</strong>, <strong>-T</strong>, <strong>-k</strong>, <strong>-u</strong>, <strong>-U</strong> and <strong>-z</strong>.  The flag <strong>-t</strong> turns on execution tracing for this function; the flag <strong>-T</strong> does the same, but turns off tracing on any function called from the present one, unless that function also has the <strong>-t</strong> or <strong>-T</strong> flag.  The <strong>-u</strong> and <strong>-U</strong> flags cause the function to be marked for autoloading; <strong>-U</strong> also causes alias expansion to be suppressed when the function is loaded.  The <strong>fpath</strong> parameter will be searched to find the function definition when the function is first referenced; see the section `Functions'. The <strong>-k</strong> and <strong>-z</strong> flags make the function be loaded using ksh-style or zsh-style autoloading respectively. If neither is given, the setting of the KSH_AUTOLOAD option determines how the function is loaded.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-h</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Hide: only useful for special parameters (those marked `&lt;S&gt;' in the table in <a href="../man1/zshparam.1.html"><strong>zshparam</strong>(1)</a>), and for local parameters with the same name as a special parameter, though harmless for others.  A special parameter with this attribute will not retain its special effect when made local.  Thus after `<strong>typeset -h</strong> PATH', a function containing `<strong>typeset PATH</strong>' will create an ordinary local parameter without the usual behaviour of <strong>PATH</strong>.  Alternatively, the local parameter may itself be given this attribute; hence inside a function `<strong>typeset -h PATH</strong>' creates an ordinary local parameter and the special <strong>PATH</strong> parameter is not altered in any way.  It is also possible to create a local parameter using `<strong>typeset +h </strong><em>special</em>', where the local copy of <em>special</em> will retain its special properties regardless of having the <strong>-h</strong> attribute.  Global special parameters loaded from shell modules (currently those in <strong>zsh/mapfile</strong> and <strong>zsh/parameter</strong>) are automatically given the <strong>-h</strong> attribute to avoid name clashes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-H</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Hide value: specifies that <strong>typeset</strong> will not display the value of the parameter when listing parameters; the display for such parameters is always as if the `<strong>+</strong>' flag had been given.  Use of the parameter is in other respects normal, and the option does not apply if the parameter is specified by name, or by pattern with the <strong>-m</strong> option.  This is on by default for the parameters in the <strong>zsh/parameter</strong> and <strong>zsh/mapfile</strong> modules.  Note, however, that unlike the <strong>-h</strong> flag this is also useful for non-special parameters.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-i</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use an internal integer representation.  If <em>n</em> is nonzero it defines the output arithmetic base, otherwise it is determined by the first assignment.  Bases from 2 to 36 inclusive are allowed.</p>
  </dd>

    <p><strong>-E</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use an internal double-precision floating point representation.  On output the variable will be converted to scientific notation.  If <em>n</em> is nonzero it defines the number of significant figures to display; the default is ten.</p>

    <p><strong>-F</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use an internal double-precision floating point representation.  On output the variable will be converted to fixed-point decimal notation.  If <em>n</em> is nonzero it defines the number of digits to display after the decimal point; the default is ten.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-t</strong></p>

  <dd>
    <p>Tags the named parameters.  Tags have no special meaning to the shell. This flag has a different meaning when used with <strong>-f</strong>; see above.</p>

    <p>Mark for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands.  If the option <strong>GLOBAL_EXPORT</strong> is set, this implies the option <strong>-g</strong>, unless <strong>+g</strong> is also explicitly given; in other words the parameter is not made local to the enclosing function.  This is for compatibility with previous versions of zsh.</p>

    <p>This builtin command can be used to compile functions or scripts, storing the compiled form in a file, and to examine files containing the compiled form.  This allows faster autoloading of functions and execution of scripts by avoiding parsing of the text when the files are read.</p><p>The first form (without the <strong>-c</strong>, <strong>-a</strong> or <strong>-t</strong> options) creates a compiled file.  If only the <em>file</em> argument is given, the output file has the name `<em>file</em><strong>.zwc</strong>' and will be placed in the same directory as the <em>file</em>.  The shell will load the compiled file instead of the normal function file when the function is autoloaded; see the section `Autoloading Functions' in <a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html"><strong>zshmisc</strong>(1)</a> for a description of how autoloaded functions are searched.  The extension <strong>.zwc</strong> stands for `zsh word code'.</p><p>If there is at least one <em>name</em> argument, all the named files are compiled into the output <em>file</em> given as the first argument.  If <em>file</em> does not end in <strong>.zwc</strong>, this extension is automatically appended.  Files containing multiple compiled functions are called `digest' files, and are intended to be used as elements of the <strong>FPATH</strong>/<strong>fpath</strong> special array.</p><p>The second form, with the <strong>-c</strong> or <strong>-a</strong> options, writes the compiled definitions for all the named functions into <em>file</em>.  For <strong>-c</strong>, the names must be functions currently defined in the shell, not those marked for autoloading.  Undefined functions that are marked for autoloading may be written by using the <strong>-a</strong> option, in which case the <strong>fpath</strong> is searched and the contents of the definition files for those functions, if found, are compiled into <em>file</em>.  If both <strong>-c</strong> and <strong>-a</strong> are given, names of both defined functions and functions marked for autoloading may be given.  In either case, the functions in files written with the <strong>-c</strong> or <strong>-a</strong> option will be autoloaded as if the <strong>KSH_AUTOLOAD</strong> option were unset.</p><p>The reason for handling loaded and not-yet-loaded functions with different options is that some definition files for autoloading define multiple functions, including the function with the same name as the file, and, at the end, call that function.  In such cases the output of `<strong>zcompile -c</strong>' does not include the additional functions defined in the file, and any other initialization code in the file is lost.  Using `<strong>zcompile -a</strong>' captures all this extra information.</p><p>If the <strong>-m</strong> option is combined with <strong>-c</strong> or <strong>-a</strong>, the <em>name</em>s are used as patterns and all functions whose names match one of these patterns will be written. If no <em>name</em> is given, the definitions of all functions currently defined or marked as autoloaded will be written.</p><p>Note the second form cannot be used for compiling functions that include redirections as part of the definition rather than within the body of the function; for example</p>
<pre>
<strong>fn1() { { ... } &gt;~/logfile }</strong>
</pre>
<p>can be compiled but</p>
<pre>
<strong>fn1() { ... } &gt;~/logfile</strong>
</pre>
<p>cannot.  It is possible to use the first form of <strong>zcompile</strong> to compile autoloadable functions that include the full function definition instead of just the body of the function.</p><p>The third form, with the <strong>-t</strong> option, examines an existing compiled file.  Without further arguments, the names of the original files compiled into it are listed.  The first line of output shows the version of the shell which compiled the file and how the file will be used (i.e. by reading it directly or by mapping it into memory). With arguments, nothing is output and the return status is set to zero if definitions for <em>all</em> <em>name</em>s were found in the compiled file, and non-zero if the definition for at least one <em>name</em> was not found.</p><p>Other options:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>

    <p>When the compiled file is read, its contents are copied into the shell's memory, rather than memory-mapped (see <strong>-M</strong>).  This happens automatically on systems that do not support memory mapping.</p><p>When compiling scripts instead of autoloadable functions, it is often desirable to use this option; otherwise the whole file, including the code to define functions which have already been defined, will remain mapped, consequently wasting memory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-M</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The compiled file is mapped into the shell's memory when read. This is done in such a way that multiple instances of the shell running on the same host will share this mapped file.  If neither <strong>-R</strong> nor <strong>-M</strong> is given, the <strong>zcompile</strong> builtin decides what to do based on the size of the compiled file.</p>

    <p>These options are used when the compiled file contains functions which are to be autoloaded. If <strong>-z</strong> is given, the function will be autoloaded as if the <strong>KSH_AUTOLOAD</strong> option is <em>not</em> set, even if it is set at the time the compiled file is read, while if the <strong>-k</strong> is given, the function will be loaded as if <strong>KSH_AUTOLOAD</strong> <em>is</em> set.  These options also take precedence over any <strong>-k</strong> or <strong>-z</strong> options specified to the <strong>autoload</strong> builtin. If neither of these options is given, the function will be loaded as determined by the setting of the <strong>KSH_AUTOLOAD</strong> option at the time the compiled file is read.</p><p>These options may also appear as many times as necessary between the listed <em>name</em>s to specify the loading style of all following functions, up to the next <strong>-k</strong> or <strong>-z</strong>.</p><p>The created file always contains two versions of the compiled format, one for big-endian machines and one for small-endian machines.  The upshot of this is that the compiled file is machine independent and if it is read or mapped, only one half of the file is actually used (and mapped).</p>

    <p>Performs operations relating to zsh's loadable modules. Loading of modules while the shell is running (`dynamical loading') is not available on all operating systems, or on all installations on a particular operating system, although the <strong>zmodload</strong> command itself is always available and can be used to manipulate modules built into versions of the shell executable without dynamical loading.</p><p>Without arguments the names of all currently loaded binary modules are printed.  The <strong>-L</strong> option causes this list to be in the form of a series of <strong>zmodload</strong> commands.  Forms with arguments are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>zmodload</strong> [ <strong>-i</strong> ] <em>name</em> ...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>zmodload</strong> <strong>-u</strong> [ <strong>-i</strong> ] <em>name</em> ...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>In the simplest case, <strong>zmodload</strong> loads a binary module.  The module must be in a file with a name consisting of the specified <em>name</em> followed by a standard suffix, usually `<strong>.so</strong>' (`<strong>.sl</strong>' on HPUX). If the module to be loaded is already loaded the duplicate module is ignored.  If <strong>zmodload</strong> detects an inconsistency, such as an invalid module name or circular dependency list, the current code block is aborted.   Hence `<strong>zmodload</strong> <em>module</em> <strong>2&gt;/dev/null</strong>' is sufficient to test whether a module is available. If it is available, the module is loaded if necessary, while if it is not available, non-zero status is silently returned.  The option <strong>-i</strong> is accepted for compatibility but has no effect.</p><p>The <em>name</em>d module is searched for in the same way a command is, using <strong>$module_path</strong> instead of <strong>$path</strong>.  However, the path search is performed even when the module name contains a `<strong>/</strong>', which it usually does. There is no way to prevent the path search.</p><p>If the module supports features (see below), <strong>zmodload</strong> tries to enable all features when loading a module.  If the module was successfully loaded but not all features could be enabled, <strong>zmodload</strong> returns status 2.</p><p>With <strong>-u</strong>, <strong>zmodload</strong> unloads modules.  The same <em>name</em> must be given that was given when the module was loaded, but it is not necessary for the module to exist in the file system. The <strong>-i</strong> option suppresses the error if the module is already unloaded (or was never loaded).</p><p>Each module has a boot and a cleanup function.  The module will not be loaded if its boot function fails.  Similarly a module can only be unloaded if its cleanup function runs successfully.</p>
  </dd>

    <p><strong>zmodload -F</strong> [ <strong>-almLe</strong> <strong>-P</strong> <strong>param</strong> ] <em>module</em> [<strong>+-</strong>]<em>feature...</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>zmodload -F</strong> allows more selective control over the features provided by modules.  With no options apart from <strong>-F</strong>, the module named <em>module</em> is loaded, if it was not already loaded, and the list of <em>feature</em>s is set to the required state.  If no <em>feature</em>s are specified, the module is loaded, if it was not already loaded, but the state of features is unchanged.  Each feature may be preceded by a <strong>+</strong> to turn the feature on, or <strong>-</strong> to turn it off; the <strong>+</strong> is assumed if neither character is present. Any feature not explicitly mentioned is left in its current state; if the module was not previously loaded this means any such features will remain disabled.  The return status is zero if all features were set, 1 if the module failed to load, and 2 if some features could not be set (for example, a parameter couldn't be added because there was a different parameter of the same name) but the module was loaded.</p><p>The standard features are builtins, conditions, parameters and math functions; these are indicated by the prefix `<strong>b:</strong>', `<strong>c:</strong>' (`<strong>C:</strong>' for an infix condition), `<strong>p:</strong>' and `<strong>f:</strong>', respectively, followed by the name that the corresponding feature would have in the shell.  For example, `<strong>b:strftime</strong>' indicates a builtin named <strong>strftime</strong> and <strong>p:EPOCHSECONDS</strong> indicates a parameter named <strong>EPOCHSECONDS</strong>.  The module may provide other (`abstract') features of its own as indicated by its documentation; these have no prefix.</p><p>With <strong>-l</strong> or <strong>-L</strong>, features provided by the module are listed.  With <strong>-l</strong> alone, a list of features together with their states is shown, one feature per line.  With <strong>-L</strong> alone, a <strong>zmodload -F</strong> command that would cause enabled features of the module to be turned on is shown.  With <strong>-lL</strong>, a <strong>zmodload -F</strong> command that would cause all the features to be set to their current state is shown.  If one of these combinations is given the option <strong>-P</strong> <em>param</em> then the parameter <strong>param</strong> is set to an array of features, either features together with their state or (if <strong>-L</strong> alone is given) enabled features.</p><p>With the option <strong>-L</strong> the module name may be omitted; then a list of all enabled features for all modules providing features is printed in the form of <strong>zmodload -F</strong> commands.  If <strong>-l</strong> is also given, the state of both enabled and disabled features is output in that form.</p><p>A set of features may be provided together with <strong>-l</strong> or <strong>-L</strong> and a module name; in that case only the state of those features is considered.  Each feature may be preceded by <strong>+</strong> or <strong>-</strong> but the character has no effect.  If no set of features is provided, all features are considered.</p><p>With <strong>-e</strong>, the command first tests that the module is loaded; if it is not, status 1 is returned.  If the module is loaded, the list of features given as an argument is examined.  Any feature given with no prefix is simply tested to see if the module provides it; any feature given with a prefix <strong>+</strong> or <strong>-</strong> is tested to see if is provided and in the given state.  If the tests on all features in the list succeed, status 0 is returned, else status 1.</p><p>With <strong>-m</strong>, each entry in the given list of features is taken as a pattern to be matched against the list of features provided by the module.  An initial <strong>+</strong> or <strong>-</strong> must be given explicitly. This may not be combined with the <strong>-a</strong> option as autoloads must be specified explicitly.</p><p>With <strong>-a</strong>, the given list of features is marked for autoload from the specified module, which may not yet be loaded.  An optional <strong>+</strong> may appear before the feature name.  If the feature is prefixed with <strong>-</strong>, any existing autoload is removed.  The options <strong>-l</strong> and <strong>-L</strong> may be used to list autoloads.  Autoloading is specific to individual features; when the module is loaded only the requested feature is enabled.  Autoload requests are preserved if the module is subsequently unloaded until an explicit `<strong>zmodload -Fa</strong> <em>module</em> <strong>-</strong><em>feature</em>' is issued.  It is not an error to request an autoload for a feature of a module that is already loaded.</p><p>When the module is loaded each autoload is checked against the features actually provided by the module; if the feature is not provided the autoload request is deleted.  A warning message is output; if the module is being loaded to provide a different feature, and that autoload is successful, there is no effect on the status of the current command. If the module is already loaded at the time when <strong>zmodload -Fa</strong> is run, an error message is printed and status 1 returned.</p><p><strong>zmodload -Fa</strong> can be used with the <strong>-l</strong>, <strong>-L</strong>, <strong>-e</strong> and <strong>-P</strong> options for listing and testing the existence of autoloadable features.  In this case <strong>-l</strong> is ignored if <strong>-L</strong> is specified. <strong>zmodload -FaL</strong> with no module name lists autoloads for all modules.</p><p>Note that only standard features as described above can be autoloaded; other features require the module to be loaded before enabling.</p>

    <p>The <strong>-ab</strong> option defines autoloaded builtins.  It defines the specified <em>builtin</em>s.  When any of those builtins is called, the module specified in the first argument is loaded and all its features are enabled (for selective control of features use `<strong>zmodload -F -a</strong>' as described above).  If only the <em>name</em> is given, one builtin is defined, with the same name as the module.  <strong>-i</strong> suppresses the error if the builtin is already defined or autoloaded, but not if another builtin of the same name is already defined.</p><p>With <strong>-ab</strong> and no arguments, all autoloaded builtins are listed, with the module name (if different) shown in parentheses after the builtin name. The <strong>-L</strong> option changes this format to a list of <strong>zmodload -a</strong> commands.</p><p>If <strong>-b</strong> is used together with the <strong>-u</strong> option, it removes builtins previously defined with <strong>-ab</strong>.  This is only possible if the builtin is not yet loaded.  <strong>-i</strong> suppresses the error if the builtin is already removed (or never existed).</p><p>Autoload requests are retained if the module is subsequently unloaded until an explicit `<strong>zmodload -ub</strong> <em>builtin</em>' is issued.</p>

If <em>module</em> is not given, show the definition of <em>modalias</em>.  If no arguments are given, list all defined module aliases. When listing, if the <strong>-L</strong> flag was also given, list the definition as a <strong>zmodload</strong> command to recreate the alias.</p><p>The existence of aliases for modules is completely independent of whether the name resolved is actually loaded as a module: while the alias exists, loading and unloading the module under any alias has exactly the same effect as using the resolved name, and does not affect the connection between the alias and the resolved name which can be removed either by <strong>zmodload -R</strong> or by redefining the alias.  Chains of aliases (i.e. where the first resolved name is itself an alias) are valid so long as these are not circular.  As the aliases take the same format as module names, they may include path separators:  in this case, there is no requirement for any part of the path named to exist as the alias will be resolved first.  For example, `<strong>any/old/alias</strong>' is always a valid alias.</p><p>Dependencies added to aliased modules are actually added to the resolved module; these remain if the alias is removed.  It is valid to create an alias whose name is one of the standard shell modules and which resolves to a different module.  However, if a module has dependencies, it will not be possible to use the module name as an alias as the module will already be marked as a loadable module in its own right.</p><p>Apart from the above, aliases can be used in the <strong>zmodload</strong> command anywhere module names are required.  However, aliases will not be shown in lists of loaded modules with a bare `<strong>zmodload</strong>'.</p>

<p>Note that <strong>zsh</strong> makes no distinction between modules that were linked into the shell and modules that are loaded dynamically.
