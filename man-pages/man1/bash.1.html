        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>Bash</strong> is an <strong>sh</strong>-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. <strong>Bash</strong> also incorporates useful features from the <em>Korn</em> and <em>C</em> shells (<strong>ksh</strong> and <strong>csh</strong>).</p><p><strong>Bash</strong> is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). <strong>Bash</strong> can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>All of the  single-character shell options documented in the description of the <strong>set</strong> builtin command can be used as options when the shell is invoked. In addition, <strong>bash</strong> interprets the following options when it is invoked:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-c</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the <strong>-c</strong> option is present, then commands are read from the first non-option argument <em>command_string</em>. If there are arguments after the <em>command_string</em>, they are assigned to the positional parameters, starting with <strong>$0</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-i</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the <strong>-i</strong> option is present, the shell is <em>interactive</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-l</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Make <strong>bash</strong> act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see <small></small> <strong>INVOCATION</strong> below).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-r</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the <strong>-r</strong> option is present, the shell becomes <em>restricted</em> (see <small></small> <strong>RESTRICTED SHELL</strong> below).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-s</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the <strong>-s</strong> option is present, or if no arguments remain after option processing, then commands are read from the standard input. This option allows the positional parameters to be set when invoking an interactive shell.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-D</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A list of all double-quoted strings preceded by <strong>$</strong> is printed on the standard output. These are the strings that are subject to language translation when the current locale is not <strong>C</strong> or <strong>POSIX</strong>. This implies the <strong>-n</strong> option; no commands will be executed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>[-+]O [</strong><em>shopt_option</em><strong>]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>shopt_option</em> is one of the shell options accepted by the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). If <em>shopt_option</em> is present, <strong>-O</strong> sets the value of that option; <strong>+O</strong> unsets it. If <em>shopt_option</em> is not supplied, the names and values of the shell options accepted by <strong>shopt</strong> are printed on the standard output. If the invocation option is <strong>+O</strong>, the output is displayed in a format that may be reused as input.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A <strong>--</strong> signals the end of options and disables further option processing. Any arguments after the <strong>--</strong> are treated as filenames and arguments.  An argument of <strong>-</strong> is equivalent to <strong>--</strong>.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p><strong>Bash</strong> also interprets a number of multi-character options. These options must appear on the command line before the single-character options to be recognized.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--debugger</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Arrange for the debugger profile to be executed before the shell starts. Turns on extended debugging mode (see the description of the <strong>extdebug</strong> option to the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin below).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--dump-po-strings</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Equivalent to <strong>-D</strong>, but the output is in the GNU <em>gettext</em> <strong>po</strong> (portable object) file format.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--rcfile</strong> <em>file</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Execute commands from <em>file</em> instead of the standard personal initialization file <em>~/.bashrc</em> if the shell is interactive (see <small></small> <strong>INVOCATION</strong> below).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--login</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Equivalent to <strong>-l</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>

    <p>Do not use the GNU <strong>readline</strong> library to read command lines when the shell is interactive.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--noprofile</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Do not read either the system-wide startup file <em>\|&#92;$1\|</em> or any of the personal initialization files <em>~/.bash_profile</em>, <em>~/.bash_login</em>, or <em>~/.profile</em>. By default, <strong>bash</strong> reads these files when it is invoked as a login shell (see <small></small> <strong>INVOCATION</strong> below).</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--posix</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change the behavior of <strong>bash</strong> where the default operation differs from the POSIX standard to match the standard (<em>posix mode</em>). See <small></small> <strong>SEE ALSO</strong> below for a reference to a document that details how posix mode affects bash's behavior.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">ARGUMENTS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the <strong>-c</strong> nor the <strong>-s</strong> option has been supplied, the first argument is assumed to be the name of a file containing shell commands. If <strong>bash</strong> is invoked in this fashion, <strong>$0</strong> is set to the name of the file, and the positional parameters are set to the remaining arguments. <strong>Bash</strong> reads and executes commands from this file, then exits. <strong>Bash</strong>'s exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script. If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0. An attempt is first made to open the file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the shell searches the directories in <small></small> <strong>PATH</strong> for the script.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">INVOCATION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>A <em>login shell</em> is one whose first character of argument zero is a <strong>-</strong>, or one started with the <strong>--login</strong> option.</p><p>An <em>interactive</em> shell is one started without non-option arguments and without the <strong>-c</strong> option whose standard input and error are both connected to terminals (as determined by <a href="../man3/isatty.3.html"><strong>isatty</strong>(3)</a>), or one started with the <strong>-i</strong> option. <small></small> <strong>PS1</strong> is set and <strong>$-</strong> includes <strong>i</strong> if <strong>bash</strong> is interactive, allowing a shell script or a startup file to test this state.</p><p>The following paragraphs describe how <strong>bash</strong> executes its startup files. If any of the files exist but cannot be read, <strong>bash</strong> reports an error. Tildes are expanded in filenames as described below under <strong>Tilde Expansion</strong> in the <small></small> <strong>EXPANSION</strong> section.</p><p>When <strong>bash</strong> is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the <strong>--login</strong> option, it first reads and executes commands from the file <em>/etc/profile</em>, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for <em>~/.bash_profile</em>, <em>~/.bash_login</em>, and <em>~/.profile</em>, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The <strong>--noprofile</strong> option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.</p><p>When a login shell exits, <strong>bash</strong> reads and executes commands from the file <em>~/.bash_logout</em>, if it exists.</p><p>When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, <strong>bash</strong> reads and executes commands from <em>~/.bashrc</em>, if that file exists. This may be inhibited by using the <strong>--norc</strong> option. The <strong>--rcfile</strong> <em>file</em> option will force <strong>bash</strong> to read and execute commands from <em>file</em> instead of <em>~/.bashrc</em>.</p><p>When <strong>bash</strong> is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, it looks for the variable <small></small> <strong>BASH_ENV</strong> in the environment, expands its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute. <strong>Bash</strong> behaves as if the following command were executed:</p><p>but the value of the <small></small> <strong>PATH</strong> variable is not used to search for the filename.</p><p>If <strong>bash</strong> is invoked with the name <strong>sh</strong>, it tries to mimic the startup behavior of historical versions of <strong>sh</strong> as closely as possible, while conforming to the POSIX standard as well. When invoked as an interactive login shell, or a non-interactive shell with the <strong>--login</strong> option, it first attempts to read and execute commands from <em>/etc/profile</em> and <em>~/.profile</em>, in that order. The <strong>--noprofile</strong> option may be used to inhibit this behavior. When invoked as an interactive shell with the name <strong>sh</strong>, <strong>bash</strong> looks for the variable <small></small> <strong>ENV</strong>, expands its value if it is defined, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute. Since a shell invoked as <strong>sh</strong> does not attempt to read and execute commands from any other startup files, the <strong>--rcfile</strong> option has no effect. A non-interactive shell invoked with the name <strong>sh</strong> does not attempt to read any other startup files. When invoked as <strong>sh</strong>, <strong>bash</strong> enters <em>posix</em> mode after the startup files are read.</p><p>When <strong>bash</strong> is started in <em>posix</em> mode, as with the <strong>--posix</strong> command line option, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files. In this mode, interactive shells expand the <small></small> <strong>ENV</strong> variable and commands are read and executed from the file whose name is the expanded value. No other startup files are read.</p><p><strong>Bash</strong> attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input connected to a network connection, as when executed by the remote shell daemon, usually <em>rshd</em>, or the secure shell daemon <em>sshd</em>. If <strong>bash</strong> determines it is being run in this fashion, it reads and executes commands from <em>~/.bashrc</em>, if that file exists and is readable. It will not do this if invoked as <strong>sh</strong>. The <strong>--norc</strong> option may be used to inhibit this behavior, and the <strong>--rcfile</strong> option may be used to force another file to be read, but neither <em>rshd</em> nor <em>sshd</em> generally invoke the shell with those options or allow them to be specified.</p><p>If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the real user (group) id, and the <strong>-p</strong> option is not supplied, no startup files are read, shell functions are not inherited from the environment, the <small></small> <strong>SHELLOPTS</strong>, <small></small> <strong>BASHOPTS</strong>, <small></small> <strong>CDPATH</strong>, and <small></small> <strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored, and the effective user id is set to the real user id. If the <strong>-p</strong> option is supplied at invocation, the startup behavior is the same, but the effective user id is not reset.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">RESERVED WORDS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><em>Reserved words</em> are words that have a special meaning to the shell. The following words are recognized as reserved when unquoted and either the first word of a simple command (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL GRAMMAR</strong> below) or the third word of a <strong>case</strong> or <strong>for</strong> command:</p><p><strong></strong></p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">SHELL GRAMMAR</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<h3>Simple Commands</h3>
<p>A <em>simple command</em> is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by <strong>blank</strong>-separated words and redirections, and terminated by a <em>control operator</em>.  The first word specifies the command to be executed, and is passed as argument zero. The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.</p><p>The return value of a <em>simple command</em> is its exit status, or 128+<em>n\^</em> if the command is terminated by signal <em>n</em>.</p>
<h3>Pipelines</h3>
<p>A <em>pipeline</em> is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators <strong>|</strong> or <strong>|&</strong>. The format for a pipeline is:</p><p>[<strong>time</strong> [<strong>-p</strong>]] [ ! ] <em>command</em> [ [<strong>|</strong>\(bv<strong>|&</strong>] <em>command2</em> ... ]</p><p>The standard output of <em>command</em> is connected via a pipe to the standard input of <em>command2</em>. This connection is performed before any redirections specified by the command (see <small></small> <strong>REDIRECTION</strong> below). If <strong>|&</strong> is used, <em>command</em>'s standard error, in addition to its standard output, is connected to <em>command2</em>'s standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for <strong>2&gt;&1 |</strong>. This implicit redirection of the standard error to the standard output is performed after any redirections specified by the command.</p><p>The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command, unless the <strong>pipefail</strong> option is enabled. If <strong>pipefail</strong> is enabled, the pipeline's return status is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully. If the reserved word <strong>!</strong> precedes a pipeline, the exit status of that pipeline is the logical negation of the exit status as described above. The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate before returning a value.</p><p>If the <strong>time</strong> reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed as well as user and system time consumed by its execution are reported when the pipeline terminates. The <strong>-p</strong> option changes the output format to that specified by POSIX. When the shell is in <em>posix mode</em>, it does not recognize <strong>time</strong> as a reserved word if the next token begins with a `-'. The <small></small> <strong>TIMEFORMAT</strong> variable may be set to a format string that specifies how the timing information should be displayed; see the description of <small></small> <strong>TIMEFORMAT</strong> under <strong>Shell Variables</strong> below.</p><p>When the shell is in <em>posix mode</em>, <strong>time</strong> may be followed by a newline.  In this case, the shell displays the total user and system time consumed by the shell and its children. The <small></small> <strong>TIMEFORMAT</strong> variable may be used to specify the format of the time information.</p><p>Each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process (i.e., in a subshell).</p>
<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>A <em>list</em> is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators <strong>;</strong>, <strong>&</strong>, <strong>&&</strong>, or <strong>||</strong>, and optionally terminated by one of <strong>;</strong>, <strong>&</strong>, or <strong>&lt;newline&gt;</strong>.</p><p>Of these list operators, <strong>&&</strong> and <strong>||</strong> have equal precedence, followed by <strong>;</strong> and <strong>&</strong>, which have equal precedence.</p><p>A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a <em>list</em> instead of a semicolon to delimit commands.</p><p>If a command is terminated by the control operator <strong>&</strong>, the shell executes the command in the <em>background</em> in a subshell.  The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.  Commands separated by a <strong>;</strong> are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in turn.  The return status is the exit status of the last command executed.</p><p>AND and OR lists are sequences of one of more pipelines separated by the <strong>&&</strong> and <strong>||</strong> control operators, respectively. AND and OR lists are executed with left associativity. An AND list has the form</p><p><em>command1</em> <strong>&&</strong> <em>command2</em></p><p><em>command2</em> is executed if, and only if, <em>command1</em> returns an exit status of zero.</p><p>An OR list has the form</p><p><em>command1</em> <strong>||</strong> <em>command2</em></p><p><em>command2</em> is executed if and only if <em>command1</em> returns a non-zero exit status. The return status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command executed in the list.</p>
<h3>Compound Commands</h3>
<p>A <em>compound command</em> is one of the following. In most cases a <em>list</em> in a command's description may be separated from the rest of the command by one or more newlines, and may be followed by a newline in place of a semicolon.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>(<em>list</em>)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>list</em> is executed in a subshell environment (see <small></small> <strong>COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT</strong> below). Variable assignments and builtin commands that affect the shell's environment do not remain in effect after the command completes.  The return status is the exit status of <em>list</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>{ <em>list</em>; }</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>list</em> is simply executed in the current shell environment. <em>list</em> must be terminated with a newline or semicolon. This is known as a <em>group command</em>. The return status is the exit status of <em>list</em>. Note that unlike the metacharacters <strong>(</strong> and <strong>)</strong>, <strong>{</strong> and <strong>}</strong> are <em>reserved words</em> and must occur where a reserved word is permitted to be recognized.  Since they do not cause a word break, they must be separated from <em>list</em> by whitespace or another shell metacharacter.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>((<em>expression</em>))</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <em>expression</em> is evaluated according to the rules described below under <small></small> <strong>ARITHMETIC EVALUATION</strong>. If the value of the expression is non-zero, the return status is 0; otherwise the return status is 1.  This is exactly equivalent to <strong>let "</strong><em>expression</em><strong>"</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>[[</strong> <em>expression</em> <strong>]]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Return a status of 0 or 1 depending on the evaluation of the conditional expression <em>expression</em>. Expressions are composed of the primaries described below under <small></small> <strong>CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS</strong>. Word splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the words between the <strong>[[</strong> and <strong>]]</strong>; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command substitution, process substitution, and quote removal are performed. Conditional operators such as <strong>-f</strong> must be unquoted to be recognized as primaries. When used with <strong>[[</strong>, the <strong>&lt;</strong> and <strong>&gt;</strong> operators sort lexicographically using the current locale. When the <strong>==</strong> and <strong>!=</strong> operators are used, the string to the right of the operator is considered a pattern and matched according to the rules described below under <strong>Pattern Matching</strong>, as if the <strong>extglob</strong> shell option were enabled. The <strong>=</strong> operator is equivalent to <strong>==</strong>. If the shell option <strong>nocasematch</strong> is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. The return value is 0 if the string matches (<strong>==</strong>) or does not match (<strong>!=</strong>) the pattern, and 1 otherwise. Any part of the pattern may be quoted to force the quoted portion to be matched as a string. An additional binary operator, <strong>=~</strong>, is available, with the same precedence as <strong>==</strong> and <strong>!=</strong>. When it is used, the string to the right of the operator is considered an extended regular expression and matched accordingly (as in <a href="../man3/regex.3.html"><strong>regex</strong>(3)</a>). The return value is 0 if the string matches the pattern, and 1 otherwise. If the regular expression is syntactically incorrect, the conditional expression's return value is 2. If the shell option <strong>nocasematch</strong> is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. Any part of the pattern may be quoted to force the quoted portion to be matched as a string. Bracket expressions in regular expressions must be treated carefully, since normal quoting characters lose their meanings between brackets. If the pattern is stored in a shell variable, quoting the variable expansion forces the entire pattern to be matched as a string. Substrings matched by parenthesized subexpressions within the regular expression are saved in the array variable <small></small> <strong>BASH_REMATCH</strong>. The element of <small></small> <strong>BASH_REMATCH</strong> with index 0 is the portion of the string matching the entire regular expression. The element of <small></small> <strong>BASH_REMATCH</strong> with index <em>n</em> is the portion of the string matching the <em>n</em>th parenthesized subexpression. Expressions may be combined using the following operators, listed in decreasing order of precedence:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>( </strong><em>expression</em><strong> )</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Returns the value of <em>expression</em>. This may be used to override the normal precedence of operators.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>! </strong><em>expression</em><strong></strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>True if <em>expression</em> is false.</p>

    <p><em>expression1</em> <strong>||</strong> <em>expression2</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>True if either <em>expression1</em> or <em>expression2</em> is true.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The <strong>&&</strong> and <strong>||</strong> operators do not evaluate <em>expression2</em> if the value of <em>expression1</em> is sufficient to determine the return value of the entire conditional expression.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>for</strong> <em>name</em> [ [ <strong>in</strong> [ <em>word ...</em> ] ] ; ] <strong>do</strong> <em>list</em> ; <strong>done</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The list of words following <strong>in</strong> is expanded, generating a list of items. The variable <em>name</em> is set to each element of this list in turn, and <em>list</em> is executed each time. If the <strong>in</strong> <em>word</em> is omitted, the <strong>for</strong> command executes <em>list</em> once for each positional parameter that is set (see <small></small> <strong>PARAMETERS</strong> below). The return status is the exit status of the last command that executes. If the expansion of the items following <strong>in</strong> results in an empty list, no commands are executed, and the return status is 0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>for</strong> (( <em>expr1</em> ; <em>expr2</em> ; <em>expr3</em> )) ; <strong>do</strong> <em>list</em> ; <strong>done</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>First, the arithmetic expression <em>expr1</em> is evaluated according to the rules described below under <small></small> <strong>ARITHMETIC EVALUATION</strong>. The arithmetic expression <em>expr2</em> is then evaluated repeatedly until it evaluates to zero. Each time <em>expr2</em> evaluates to a non-zero value, <em>list</em> is executed and the arithmetic expression <em>expr3</em> is evaluated. If any expression is omitted, it behaves as if it evaluates to 1. The return value is the exit status of the last command in <em>list</em> that is executed, or false if any of the expressions is invalid.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>select</strong> <em>name</em> [ <strong>in</strong> <em>word</em> ] ; <strong>do</strong> <em>list</em> ; <strong>done</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The list of words following <strong>in</strong> is expanded, generating a list of items.  The set of expanded words is printed on the standard error, each preceded by a number.  If the <strong>in</strong> <em>word</em> is omitted, the positional parameters are printed (see <small></small> <strong>PARAMETERS</strong> below).  The <small></small> <strong>PS3</strong> prompt is then displayed and a line read from the standard input. If the line consists of a number corresponding to one of the displayed words, then the value of <em>name</em> is set to that word.  If the line is empty, the words and prompt are displayed again.  If EOF is read, the command completes.  Any other value read causes <em>name</em> to be set to null.  The line read is saved in the variable <small></small> <strong>REPLY</strong>. The <em>list</em> is executed after each selection until a <strong>break</strong> command is executed. The exit status of <strong>select</strong> is the exit status of the last command executed in <em>list</em>, or zero if no commands were executed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>case</strong> <em>word</em> <strong>in</strong> [ [(] <em>pattern</em> [ <strong>|</strong> <em>pattern</em> ]  ... ) <em>list</em> ;; ] ... <strong>esac</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A <strong>case</strong> command first expands <em>word</em>, and tries to match it against each <em>pattern</em> in turn, using the same matching rules as for pathname expansion (see <strong>Pathname Expansion</strong> below). The <em>word</em> is expanded using tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic substitution, command substitution, process substitution and quote removal. Each <em>pattern</em> examined is expanded using tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic substitution, command substitution, and process substitution. If the shell option <strong>nocasematch</strong> is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. When a match is found, the corresponding <em>list</em> is executed. If the <strong>;;</strong> operator is used, no subsequent matches are attempted after the first pattern match. Using <strong>;&</strong> in place of <strong>;;</strong> causes execution to continue with the <em>list</em> associated with the next set of patterns. Using <strong>;;&</strong> in place of <strong>;;</strong> causes the shell to test the next pattern list in the statement, if any, and execute any associated <em>list</em> on a successful match. The exit status is zero if no pattern matches.  Otherwise, it is the exit status of the last command executed in <em>list</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>if</strong> <em>list</em>; <strong>then</strong> <em>list</em>;  [ <strong>elif</strong> <em>list</em>; <strong>then</strong> <em>list</em>; ] ...  [ <strong>else</strong> <em>list</em>; ] <strong>fi</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <strong>if</strong> <em>list</em> is executed.  If its exit status is zero, the <strong>then</strong> <em>list</em> is executed.  Otherwise, each <strong>elif</strong> <em>list</em> is executed in turn, and if its exit status is zero, the corresponding <strong>then</strong> <em>list</em> is executed and the command completes.  Otherwise, the <strong>else</strong> <em>list</em> is executed, if present.  The exit status is the exit status of the last command executed, or zero if no condition tested true.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>until</strong> <em>list-1</em>; <strong>do</strong> <em>list-2</em>; <strong>done</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <strong>while</strong> command continuously executes the list <em>list-2</em> as long as the last command in the list <em>list-1</em> returns an exit status of zero.  The <strong>until</strong> command is identical to the <strong>while</strong> command, except that the test is negated; <em>list-2</em> is executed as long as the last command in <em>list-1</em> returns a non-zero exit status. The exit status of the <strong>while</strong> and <strong>until</strong> commands is the exit status of the last command executed in <em>list-2</em>, or zero if none was executed.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>Coprocesses</h3>
<p>A <em>coprocess</em> is a shell command preceded by the <strong>coproc</strong> reserved word. A coprocess is executed asynchronously in a subshell, as if the command had been terminated with the <strong>&</strong> control operator, with a two-way pipe established between the executing shell and the coprocess.</p><p>The format for a coprocess is:</p><p><strong>coproc</strong> [<em>NAME</em>] <em>command</em> [<em>redirections</em>]</p><p>This creates a coprocess named <em>NAME</em>. If <em>NAME</em> is not supplied, the default name is <strong>COPROC</strong>. <em>NAME</em> must not be supplied if <em>command</em> is a <em>simple</em> command (see above); otherwise, it is interpreted as the first word of the simple command. When the coprocess is executed, the shell creates an array variable (see <strong>Arrays</strong> below) named <em>NAME</em> in the context of the executing shell. The standard output of <em>command</em> is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor is assigned to <em>NAME</em>[0]. The standard input of <em>command</em> is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor is assigned to <em>NAME</em>[1]. This pipe is established before any redirections specified by the command (see <small></small> <strong>REDIRECTION</strong> below). The file descriptors can be utilized as arguments to shell commands and redirections using standard word expansions. The file descriptors are not available in subshells. The process ID of the shell spawned to execute the coprocess is available as the value of the variable <em>NAME</em>_PID. The <strong>wait</strong> builtin command may be used to wait for the coprocess to terminate.</p><p>Since the coprocess is created as an asynchronous command, the <strong>coproc</strong> command always returns success. The return status of a coprocess is the exit status of <em>command</em>.</p>
<h3>Shell Function Definitions</h3>
<p>A shell function is an object that is called like a simple command and executes a compound command with a new set of positional parameters. Shell functions are declared as follows:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>name</em> () <em>compound-command</em> [<em>redirection</em>]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>function</strong> <em>name</em> [()] <em>compound-command</em> [<em>redirection</em>]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This defines a function named <em>name</em>. The reserved word <strong>function</strong> is optional. If the <strong>function</strong> reserved word is supplied, the parentheses are optional. The <em>body</em> of the function is the compound command <em>compound-command</em> (see <strong>Compound Commands</strong> above). That command is usually a <em>list</em> of commands between { and }, but may be any command listed under <strong>Compound Commands</strong> above. <em>compound-command</em> is executed whenever <em>name</em> is specified as the name of a simple command. When in <em>posix mode</em>, <em>name</em> may not be the name of one of the POSIX <em>special builtins</em>. Any redirections (see <small></small> <strong>REDIRECTION</strong> below) specified when a function is defined are performed when the function is executed. The exit status of a function definition is zero unless a syntax error occurs or a readonly function with the same name already exists. When executed, the exit status of a function is the exit status of the last command executed in the body.  (See <small></small> <strong>FUNCTIONS</strong> below.)</p>

<p>In a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the <strong>interactive_comments</strong> option to the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin is enabled (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below), a word beginning with <strong>#</strong> causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored.  An interactive shell without the <strong>interactive_comments</strong> option enabled does not allow comments.

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">QUOTING</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><em>Quoting</em> is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell.  Quoting can be used to disable special treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being recognized as such, and to prevent parameter expansion.</p><p>Each of the <em>metacharacters</em> listed above under <small></small> <strong>DEFINITIONS</strong> has special meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself.</p><p>When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see <small></small> <strong>HISTORY EXPANSION</strong> below), the <em>history expansion</em> character, usually <strong>!</strong>, must be quoted to prevent history expansion.</p><p>There are three quoting mechanisms: the <em>escape character</em>, single quotes, and double quotes.</p><p>A non-quoted backslash (<strong>&#92;</strong>) is the <em>escape character</em>. It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of &lt;newline&gt;.  If a <strong>&#92;</strong>&lt;newline&gt; pair appears, and the backslash is not itself quoted, the <strong>&#92;</strong>&lt;newline&gt; is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).</p><p>Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.</p><p>Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of <strong>$</strong>, <strong>&#96;</strong>, <strong>&#92;</strong>, and, when history expansion is enabled, <strong>!</strong>. The characters <strong>$</strong> and <strong>&#96;</strong> retain their special meaning within double quotes.  The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: <strong>$</strong>, <strong>&#96;</strong>, \^<strong>"</strong>\^, <strong>&#92;</strong>, or <strong>&lt;newline&gt;</strong>. A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an <strong>!</strong> appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. The backslash preceding the <strong>!</strong> is not removed.</p><p>The special parameters <strong>*</strong> and <strong>@</strong> have special meaning when in double quotes (see <small></small> <strong>PARAMETERS</strong> below).</p><p>Words of the form <strong>$</strong>&apos;<em>string</em>&apos; are treated specially.  The word expands to <em>string</em>, with backslash-escaped characters replaced as specified by the ANSI C standard.  Backslash escape sequences, if present, are decoded as follows:</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">PARAMETERS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>A <em>parameter</em> is an entity that stores values. It can be a <em>name</em>, a number, or one of the special characters listed below under <strong>Special Parameters</strong>. A <em>variable</em> is a parameter denoted by a <em>name</em>. A variable has a <em>value</em> and zero or more <em>attributes</em>. Attributes are assigned using the <strong>declare</strong> builtin command (see <strong>declare</strong> below in <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong>).</p><p>A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value.  The null string is a valid value.  Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by using the <strong>unset</strong> builtin command (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below).</p><p>A <em>variable</em> may be assigned to by a statement of the form</p><p><em>name</em>=[<em>value</em>]</p><p>If <em>value</em> is not given, the variable is assigned the null string.  All <em>values</em> undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal (see <small></small> <strong>EXPANSION</strong> below).  If the variable has its <strong>integer</strong> attribute set, then <em>value</em> is evaluated as an arithmetic expression even if the $((...)) expansion is not used (see <strong>Arithmetic Expansion</strong> below). Word splitting is not performed, with the exception of <strong>"$@"</strong> as explained below under <strong>Special Parameters</strong>. Pathname expansion is not performed. Assignment statements may also appear as arguments to the <strong>alias</strong>, <strong>declare</strong>, <strong>typeset</strong>, <strong>export</strong>, <strong>readonly</strong>, and <strong>local</strong> builtin commands. When in <em>posix mode</em>, these builtins may appear in a command after one or more instances of the <strong>command</strong> builtin and retain these assignment statement properties.</p><p>In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a shell variable or array index, the += operator can be used to append to or add to the variable's previous value. When += is applied to a variable for which the <em>integer</em> attribute has been set, <em>value</em> is evaluated as an arithmetic expression and added to the variable's current value, which is also evaluated. When += is applied to an array variable using compound assignment (see <strong>Arrays</strong> below), the variable's value is not unset (as it is when using =), and new values are appended to the array beginning at one greater than the array's maximum index (for indexed arrays) or added as additional key-value pairs in an associative array. When applied to a string-valued variable, <em>value</em> is expanded and appended to the variable's value.</p><p>A variable can be assigned the <em>nameref</em> attribute using the <strong>-n</strong> option to the <strong>declare</strong> or <strong>local</strong> builtin commands (see the descriptions of <strong>declare</strong> and <strong>local</strong> below) to create a <em>nameref</em>, or a reference to another variable. This allows variables to be manipulated indirectly. Whenever the nameref variable is referenced or assigned to, the operation is actually performed on the variable specified by the nameref variable's value. A nameref is commonly used within shell functions to refer to a variable whose name is passed as an argument to the function. For instance, if a variable name is passed to a shell function as its first argument, running</p><p>inside the function creates a nameref variable <strong>ref</strong> whose value is the variable name passed as the first argument. References and assignments to <strong>ref</strong> are treated as references and assignments to the variable whose name was passed as <strong>$1</strong>. If the control variable in a <strong>for</strong> loop has the nameref attribute, the list of words can be a list of shell variables, and a name reference will be established for each word in the list, in turn, when the loop is executed. Array variables cannot be given the <strong>-n</strong> attribute. However, nameref variables can reference array variables and subscripted array variables. Namerefs can be unset using the <strong>-n</strong> option to the <strong>unset</strong> builtin. Otherwise, if <strong>unset</strong> is executed with the name of a nameref variable as an argument, the variable referenced by the nameref variable will be unset.</p><h3>Positional Parameters</h3>
<p>A <em>positional parameter</em> is a parameter denoted by one or more digits, other than the single digit 0.  Positional parameters are assigned from the shell's arguments when it is invoked, and may be reassigned using the <strong>set</strong> builtin command.  Positional parameters may not be assigned to with assignment statements.  The positional parameters are temporarily replaced when a shell function is executed (see <small></small> <strong>FUNCTIONS</strong> below).</p><p>When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see <small></small> <strong>EXPANSION</strong> below).</p>
<h3>Special Parameters</h3>
<p>The shell treats several parameters specially.  These parameters may only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>*</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion is not within double quotes, each positional parameter expands to a separate word. In contexts where it is performed, those words are subject to further word splitting and pathname expansion. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands to a single word with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> special variable.  That is, "<strong>$*</strong>" is equivalent to "<strong>$1</strong><em>c</em><strong>$2</strong><em>c</em><strong>...</strong>", where <em>c</em> is the first character of the value of the <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> variable.  If <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> is unset, the parameters are separated by spaces. If <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> is null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>@</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  When the expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter expands to a separate word.  That is, "<strong>$@</strong>" is equivalent to "<strong>$1</strong>" "<strong>$2</strong>" ... If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last part of the original word. When there are no positional parameters, "<strong>$@</strong>" and <strong>$@</strong> expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>?</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Expands to the current option flags as specified upon invocation, by the <strong>set</strong> builtin command, or those set by the shell itself (such as the <strong>-i</strong> option).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>$</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Expands to the process ID of the shell.  In a () subshell, it expands to the process ID of the current shell, not the subshell.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>!</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Expands to the process ID of the job most recently placed into the background, whether executed as an asynchronous command or using the <strong>bg</strong> builtin (see <small></small> <strong>JOB CONTROL</strong> below).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>0</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.  This is set at shell initialization.  If <strong>bash</strong> is invoked with a file of commands, <strong>$0</strong> is set to the name of that file.  If <strong>bash</strong> is started with the <strong>-c</strong> option, then <strong>$0</strong> is set to the first argument after the string to be executed, if one is present.  Otherwise, it is set to the filename used to invoke <strong>bash</strong>, as given by argument zero.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>_</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>At shell startup, set to the absolute pathname used to invoke the shell or shell script being executed as passed in the environment or argument list. Subsequently, expands to the last argument to the previous command, after expansion. Also set to the full pathname used to invoke each command executed and placed in the environment exported to that command. When checking mail, this parameter holds the name of the mail file currently being checked.</p>

  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The following variables are used by the shell.  In some cases, <strong>bash</strong> assigns a default value to a variable; these cases are noted below.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>BASH_COMPAT</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The value is used to set the shell's compatibility level. See the description of the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin below under <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> for a description of the various compatibility levels and their effects. The value may be a decimal number (e.g., 4.2) or an integer (e.g., 42) corresponding to the desired compatibility level. If <strong>BASH_COMPAT</strong> is unset or set to the empty string, the compatibility level is set to the default for the current version. If <strong>BASH_COMPAT</strong> is set to a value that is not one of the valid compatibility levels, the shell prints an error message and sets the compatibility level to the default for the current version. The valid compatibility levels correspond to the compatibility options accepted by the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin described below (for example, <strong>compat42</strong> means that 4.2 and 42 are valid values). The current version is also a valid value.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>BASH_ENV</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this parameter is set when <strong>bash</strong> is executing a shell script, its value is interpreted as a filename containing commands to initialize the shell, as in <em>~/.bashrc</em>. The value of <small></small> <strong>BASH_ENV</strong> is subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a filename. <small></small> <strong>PATH</strong> is not used to search for the resultant filename.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>BASH_XTRACEFD</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to an integer corresponding to a valid file descriptor, <strong>bash</strong> will write the trace output generated when is enabled to that file descriptor. The file descriptor is closed when <small></small> <strong>BASH_XTRACEFD</strong> is unset or assigned a new value. Unsetting <small></small> <strong>BASH_XTRACEFD</strong> or assigning it the empty string causes the trace output to be sent to the standard error. Note that setting <small></small> <strong>BASH_XTRACEFD</strong> to 2 (the standard error file descriptor) and then unsetting it will result in the standard error being closed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>CDPATH</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The search path for the <strong>cd</strong> command. This is a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for destination directories specified by the <strong>cd</strong> command. A sample value is</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>CHILD_MAX</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the number of exited child status values for the shell to remember. Bash will not allow this value to be decreased below a POSIX-mandated minimum, and there is a maximum value (currently 8192) that this may not exceed. The minimum value is system-dependent.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>COLUMNS</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Used by the <strong>select</strong> compound command to determine the terminal width when printing selection lists. Automatically set if the <strong>checkwinsize</strong> option is enabled or in an interactive shell upon receipt of a <small></small> <strong>SIGWINCH</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>COMPREPLY</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>An array variable from which <strong>bash</strong> reads the possible completions generated by a shell function invoked by the programmable completion facility (see <strong>Programmable Completion</strong> below). Each array element contains one possible completion.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>EMACS</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If <strong>bash</strong> finds this variable in the environment when the shell starts with value it assumes that the shell is running in an Emacs shell buffer and disables line editing.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ENV</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Similar to <small></small> <strong>BASH_ENV</strong>; used when the shell is invoked in POSIX mode.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>FCEDIT</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The default editor for the <strong>fc</strong> builtin command.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>FIGNORE</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when performing filename completion (see <small></small> <strong>READLINE</strong> below). A filename whose suffix matches one of the entries in <small></small> <strong>FIGNORE</strong> is excluded from the list of matched filenames. A sample value is</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>FUNCNEST</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a maximum function nesting level.  Function invocations that exceed this nesting level will cause the current command to abort.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of filenames to be ignored by pathname expansion. If a filename matched by a pathname expansion pattern also matches one of the patterns in <small></small> <strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong>, it is removed from the list of matches.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>HISTCONTROL</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A colon-separated list of values controlling how commands are saved on the history list. If the list of values includes <em>ignorespace</em>, lines which begin with a <strong>space</strong> character are not saved in the history list. A value of <em>ignoredups</em> causes lines matching the previous history entry to not be saved. A value of <em>ignoreboth</em> is shorthand for <em>ignorespace</em> and <em>ignoredups</em>. A value of <em>erasedups</em> causes all previous lines matching the current line to be removed from the history list before that line is saved. Any value not in the above list is ignored. If <small></small> <strong>HISTCONTROL</strong> is unset, or does not include a valid value, all lines read by the shell parser are saved on the history list, subject to the value of <small></small> <strong>HISTIGNORE</strong>. The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the value of <small></small> <strong>HISTCONTROL</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>HISTFILE</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The name of the file in which command history is saved (see <small></small> <strong>HISTORY</strong> below).  The default value is <em>~/.bash_history</em>.  If unset, the command history is not saved when a shell exits.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>HISTFILESIZE</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum number of lines contained in the history file.  When this variable is assigned a value, the history file is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than that number of lines by removing the oldest entries. The history file is also truncated to this size after writing it when a shell exits. If the value is 0, the history file is truncated to zero size. Non-numeric values and numeric values less than zero inhibit truncation. The shell sets the default value to the value of <strong>HISTSIZE</strong> after reading any startup files.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>HISTIGNORE</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A colon-separated list of patterns used to decide which command lines should be saved on the history list.  Each pattern is anchored at the beginning of the line and must match the complete line (no implicit `<strong>*</strong>' is appended).  Each pattern is tested against the line after the checks specified by <small></small> <strong>HISTCONTROL</strong> are applied. In addition to the normal shell pattern matching characters, `<strong>&</strong>' matches the previous history line.  `<strong>&</strong>' may be escaped using a backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting a match. The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the value of <small></small> <strong>HISTIGNORE</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>HISTSIZE</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The number of commands to remember in the command history (see <small></small> <strong>HISTORY</strong> below). If the value is 0, commands are not saved in the history list. Numeric values less than zero result in every command being saved on the history list (there is no limit). The shell sets the default value to 500 after reading any startup files.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>HISTTIMEFORMAT</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this variable is set and not null, its value is used as a format string for <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html"><strong>strftime</strong>(3)</a> to print the time stamp associated with each history entry displayed by the <strong>history</strong> builtin. If this variable is set, time stamps are written to the history file so they may be preserved across shell sessions. This uses the history comment character to distinguish timestamps from other history lines.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>HOME</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The home directory of the current user; the default argument for the <strong>cd</strong> builtin command. The value of this variable is also used when performing tilde expansion.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>HOSTFILE</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Contains the name of a file in the same format as that should be read when the shell needs to complete a hostname. The list of possible hostname completions may be changed while the shell is running; the next time hostname completion is attempted after the value is changed, <strong>bash</strong> adds the contents of the new file to the existing list. If <small></small> <strong>HOSTFILE</strong> is set, but has no value, or does not name a readable file, <strong>bash</strong> attempts to read to obtain the list of possible hostname completions. When <small></small> <strong>HOSTFILE</strong> is unset, the hostname list is cleared.</p>

    <p><strong>IFS</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <em>Internal Field Separator</em> that is used for word splitting after expansion and to split lines into words with the <strong>read</strong> builtin command.  The default value is ``&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;''.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>IGNOREEOF</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Controls the action of an interactive shell on receipt of an <small></small> <strong>EOF</strong> character as the sole input.  If set, the value is the number of consecutive <small></small> <strong>EOF</strong> characters which must be typed as the first characters on an input line before <strong>bash</strong> exits.  If the variable exists but does not have a numeric value, or has no value, the default value is 10.  If it does not exist, <small></small> <strong>EOF</strong> signifies the end of input to the shell.</p>
  </dd>

    <p><strong>MAIL</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this parameter is set to a file or directory name and the <small></small> <strong>MAILPATH</strong> variable is not set, <strong>bash</strong> informs the user of the arrival of mail in the specified file or Maildir-format directory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MAILCHECK</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies how often (in seconds) <strong>bash</strong> checks for mail.  The default is 60 seconds.  When it is time to check for mail, the shell does so before displaying the primary prompt. If this variable is unset, or set to a value that is not a number greater than or equal to zero, the shell disables mail checking.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MAILPATH</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A colon-separated list of filenames to be checked for mail. The message to be printed when mail arrives in a particular file may be specified by separating the filename from the message with a `?'. When used in the text of the message, <strong>$_</strong> expands to the name of the current mailfile. Example:</p><p><strong>MAILPATH</strong>=&apos;/var/mail/bfox?"You have mail":~/shell-mail?"$_ has mail!"&apos;</p><p><strong>Bash</strong> supplies a default value for this variable, but the location of the user mail files that it uses is system dependent (e.g., /var/mail/<strong>$USER</strong>).</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>OPTERR</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to the value 1, <strong>bash</strong> displays error messages generated by the <strong>getopts</strong> builtin command (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). <small></small> <strong>OPTERR</strong> is initialized to 1 each time the shell is invoked or a shell script is executed.</p>

A zero-length (null) directory name in the value of <small></small> <strong>PATH</strong> indicates the current directory. A null directory name may appear as two adjacent colons, or as an initial or trailing colon. The default path is system-dependent, and is set by the administrator who installs <strong>bash</strong>. A common value is</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>POSIXLY_CORRECT</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this variable is in the environment when <strong>bash</strong> starts, the shell enters <em>posix mode</em> before reading the startup files, as if the <strong>--posix</strong> invocation option had been supplied.

  <dt>
    <p><strong>TIMEFORMAT</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The value of this parameter is used as a format string specifying how the timing information for pipelines prefixed with the <strong>time</strong> reserved word should be displayed. The <strong>%</strong> character introduces an escape sequence that is expanded to a time value or other information. The escape sequences and their meanings are as follows; the braces denote optional portions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The optional <em>p</em> is a digit specifying the <em>precision</em>, the number of fractional digits after a decimal point. A value of 0 causes no decimal point or fraction to be output. At most three places after the decimal point may be specified; values of <em>p</em> greater than 3 are changed to 3. If <em>p</em> is not specified, the value 3 is used.</p></li><li><p>The optional <strong>l</strong> specifies a longer format, including minutes, of the form <em>MM</em>m<em>SS</em>.<em>FF</em>s. The value of <em>p</em> determines whether or not the fraction is included.</p></li><li><p>If this variable is not set, <strong>bash</strong> acts as if it had the value <strong>$&apos;&#92;nreal&#92;t%3lR&#92;nuser&#92;t%3lU&#92;nsys&#92;t%3lS&apos;</strong>.

  <dd>
    <p>If set to a value greater than zero, <small></small> <strong>TMOUT</strong> is treated as the default timeout for the <strong>read</strong> builtin. The <strong>select</strong> command terminates if input does not arrive after <small></small> <strong>TMOUT</strong> seconds when input is coming from a terminal. In an interactive shell, the value is interpreted as the number of seconds to wait for a line of input after issuing the primary prompt. <strong>Bash</strong> terminates after waiting for that number of seconds if a complete line of input does not arrive.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This variable controls how the shell interacts with the user and job control.  If this variable is set, single word simple commands without redirections are treated as candidates for resumption of an existing stopped job.  There is no ambiguity allowed; if there is more than one job beginning with the string typed, the job most recently accessed is selected.  The <em>name</em> of a stopped job, in this context, is the command line used to start it. If set to the value <em>exact</em>, the string supplied must match the name of a stopped job exactly; if set to <em>substring</em>, the string supplied needs to match a substring of the name of a stopped job.  The <em>substring</em> value provides functionality analogous to the <strong>%?</strong> job identifier (see <small></small> <strong>JOB CONTROL</strong> below).  If set to any other value, the supplied string must be a prefix of a stopped job's name; this provides functionality analogous to the <strong>%</strong><em>string</em> job identifier.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The two or three characters which control history expansion and tokenization (see <small></small> <strong>HISTORY EXPANSION</strong> below).  The first character is the <em>history expansion</em> character, the character which signals the start of a history expansion, normally `<strong>!</strong>'. The second character is the <em>quick substitution</em> character, which is used as shorthand for re-running the previous command entered, substituting one string for another in the command. The default is `<strong>^</strong>'. The optional third character is the character which indicates that the remainder of the line is a comment when found as the first character of a word, normally `<strong>#</strong>'.  The history comment character causes history substitution to be skipped for the remaining words on the line.  It does not necessarily cause the shell parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>Arrays</h3>
<p><strong>Bash</strong> provides one-dimensional indexed and associative array variables. Any variable may be used as an indexed array; the <strong>declare</strong> builtin will explicitly declare an array. There is no maximum limit on the size of an array, nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned contiguously. Indexed arrays are referenced using integers (including arithmetic expressions)  and are zero-based; associative arrays are referenced using arbitrary strings. Unless otherwise noted, indexed array indices must be non-negative integers.</p><p>An indexed array is created automatically if any variable is assigned to using the syntax <em>name</em>[<em>subscript</em>]=<em>value</em>.  The <em>subscript</em> is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evaluate to a number. To explicitly declare an indexed array, use <strong>declare -a </strong><em>name</em><strong></strong> (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). <strong>declare -a </strong><em>name</em><strong>[</strong><em>subscript</em><strong>]</strong> is also accepted; the <em>subscript</em> is ignored.</p><p>Associative arrays are created using <strong>declare -A </strong><em>name</em><strong></strong>.</p><p>Attributes may be specified for an array variable using the <strong>declare</strong> and <strong>readonly</strong> builtins.  Each attribute applies to all members of an array.</p><p>Arrays are assigned to using compound assignments of the form <em>name</em>=<strong>(</strong>value<em>1</em> ... value<em>n</em><strong>)</strong>, where each <em>value</em> is of the form [<em>subscript</em>]=<em>string</em>. Indexed array assignments do not require anything but <em>string</em>. When assigning to indexed arrays, if the optional brackets and subscript are supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the index of the element assigned is the last index assigned to by the statement plus one.  Indexing starts at zero.</p><p>When assigning to an associative array, the subscript is required.</p><p>This syntax is also accepted by the <strong>declare</strong> builtin.  Individual array elements may be assigned to using the <em>name</em>[<em>subscript</em>]=<em>value</em> syntax introduced above. When assigning to an indexed array, if <em>name</em> is subscripted by a negative number, that number is interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of <em>name</em>, so negative indices count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last element.</p><p>Any element of an array may be referenced using ${<em>name</em>[<em>subscript</em>]}.  The braces are required to avoid conflicts with pathname expansion.  If <em>subscript</em> is <strong>@</strong> or <strong>*</strong>, the word expands to all members of <em>name</em>.  These subscripts differ only when the word appears within double quotes.  If the word is double-quoted, ${<em>name</em>[*]} expands to a single word with the value of each array member separated by the first character of the <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> special variable, and ${<em>name</em>[@]} expands each element of <em>name</em> to a separate word.  When there are no array members, ${<em>name</em>[@]} expands to nothing. If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last part of the original word. This is analogous to the expansion of the special parameters <strong>*</strong> and <strong>@</strong> (see <strong>Special Parameters</strong> above).  ${#<em>name</em>[<em>subscript</em>]} expands to the length of ${<em>name</em>[<em>subscript</em>]}.  If <em>subscript</em> is <strong>*</strong> or <strong>@</strong>, the expansion is the number of elements in the array. Referencing an array variable without a subscript is equivalent to referencing the array with a subscript of 0. If the <em>subscript</em> used to reference an element of an indexed array evaluates to a number less than zero, it is interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of the array, so negative indices count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last element.</p><p>An array variable is considered set if a subscript has been assigned a value.  The null string is a valid value.</p><p>It is possible to obtain the keys (indices) of an array as well as the values. ${<strong>!</strong><em>name</em>[<em>@</em>]} and ${<strong>!</strong><em>name</em>[<em>*</em>]} expand to the indices assigned in array variable <em>name</em>. The treatment when in double quotes is similar to the expansion of the special parameters <em>@</em> and <em>*</em> within double quotes.</p><p>The <strong>unset</strong> builtin is used to destroy arrays.  <strong>unset</strong> <em>name</em>[<em>subscript</em>] destroys the array element at index <em>subscript</em>. Negative subscripts to indexed arrays are interpreted as described above. Care must be taken to avoid unwanted side effects caused by pathname expansion. <strong>unset</strong> <em>name</em>, where <em>name</em> is an array, or <strong>unset</strong> <em>name</em>[<em>subscript</em>], where <em>subscript</em> is <strong>*</strong> or <strong>@</strong>, removes the entire array.</p><p>The <strong>declare</strong>, <strong>local</strong>, and <strong>readonly</strong> builtins each accept a <strong>-a</strong> option to specify an indexed array and a <strong>-A</strong> option to specify an associative array. If both options are supplied, <strong>-A</strong> takes precedence. The <strong>read</strong> builtin accepts a <strong>-a</strong> option to assign a list of words read from the standard input to an array.  The <strong>set</strong> and <strong>declare</strong> builtins display array values in a way that allows them to be reused as assignments.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">EXPANSION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into words.  There are seven kinds of expansion performed: <em>brace expansion</em>, <em>tilde expansion</em>, <em>parameter and variable expansion</em>, <em>command substitution</em>, <em>arithmetic expansion</em>, <em>word splitting</em>, and <em>pathname expansion</em>.</p><p>The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; and pathname expansion.</p><p>On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion available: <em>process substitution</em>. This is performed at the same time as tilde, parameter, variable, and arithmetic expansion and command substitution.</p><p>Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can change the number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand a single word to a single word. The only exceptions to this are the expansions of "<strong>$@</strong>" and "<strong>${</strong><em>name</em><strong>[@]}</strong>" as explained above (see <small></small> <strong>PARAMETERS</strong>).</p><h3>Brace Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Brace expansion</em> is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated.  This mechanism is similar to <em>pathname expansion</em>, but the filenames generated need not exist.  Patterns to be brace expanded take the form of an optional <em>preamble</em>, followed by either a series of comma-separated strings or a sequence expression between a pair of braces, followed by an optional <em>postscript</em>. The preamble is prefixed to each string contained within the braces, and the postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expanding left to right.</p><p>Brace expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left to right order is preserved. For example, a<strong>{</strong>d,c,b<strong>}</strong>e expands into `ade ace abe'.</p><p>A sequence expression takes the form <strong>{</strong><em>x</em><strong>..</strong><em>y</em><strong>[..</strong><em>incr</em><strong>]}</strong>, where <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are either integers or single characters, and <em>incr</em>, an optional increment, is an integer. When integers are supplied, the expression expands to each number between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, inclusive. Supplied integers may be prefixed with <em>0</em> to force each term to have the same width. When either <em>x</em> or <em>y</em> begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same number of digits, zero-padding where necessary. When characters are supplied, the expression expands to each character lexicographically between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, inclusive, using the default C locale. Note that both <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> must be of the same type. When the increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between each term.  The default increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.</p><p>Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any characters special to other expansions are preserved in the result.  It is strictly textual. <strong>Bash</strong> does not apply any syntactic interpretation to the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.</p><p>A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence expression. Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged. A <strong>{</strong> or <strong>,</strong> may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being considered part of a brace expression. To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the string <strong>${</strong> is not considered eligible for brace expansion.</p><p>This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of the strings to be generated is longer than in the above example:</p><p>mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}</p><p>or</p><p>chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}</p><p>Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with historical versions of <strong>sh</strong>. <strong>sh</strong> does not treat opening or closing braces specially when they appear as part of a word, and preserves them in the output. <strong>Bash</strong> removes braces from words as a consequence of brace expansion.  For example, a word entered to <strong>sh</strong> as <em>file{1,2}</em> appears identically in the output.  The same word is output as <em>file1 file2</em> after expansion by <strong>bash</strong>. If strict compatibility with <strong>sh</strong> is desired, start <strong>bash</strong> with the <strong>+B</strong> option or disable brace expansion with the <strong>+B</strong> option to the <strong>set</strong> command (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below).</p>
<h3>Tilde Expansion</h3>
<p>If a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`<strong>~</strong>'), all of the characters preceding the first unquoted slash (or all characters, if there is no unquoted slash) are considered a <em>tilde-prefix</em>. If none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible <em>login name</em>. If this login name is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the value of the shell parameter <small></small> <strong>HOME</strong>. If <small></small> <strong>HOME</strong> is unset, the home directory of the user executing the shell is substituted instead. Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the home directory associated with the specified login name.</p><p>If the tilde-prefix is a `~+', the value of the shell variable <small></small> <strong>PWD</strong> replaces the tilde-prefix. If the tilde-prefix is a `~-', the value of the shell variable <small></small> <strong>OLDPWD</strong>, if it is set, is substituted. If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number <em>N</em>, optionally prefixed by a `+' or a `-', the tilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding element from the directory stack, as it would be displayed by the <strong>dirs</strong> builtin invoked with the tilde-prefix as an argument. If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number without a leading `+' or `-', `+' is assumed.</p><p>If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is unchanged.</p><p>Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes immediately following a <strong>:</strong> or the first <strong>=</strong>. In these cases, tilde expansion is also performed. Consequently, one may use filenames with tildes in assignments to <small></small> <strong>PATH</strong>, <small></small> <strong>MAILPATH</strong>, and <small></small> <strong>CDPATH</strong>, and the shell assigns the expanded value.</p>
<h3>Parameter Expansion</h3>
<p>The `<strong>$</strong>' character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion.  The parameter name or symbol to be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which are optional but serve to protect the variable to be expanded from characters immediately following it which could be interpreted as part of the name.</p><p>When braces are used, the matching ending brace is the first `<strong>}</strong>' not escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not within an embedded arithmetic expansion, command substitution, or parameter expansion.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>${<em>parameter</em>}</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The value of <em>parameter</em> is substituted.  The braces are required when <em>parameter</em> is a positional parameter with more than one digit, or when <em>parameter</em> is followed by a character which is not to be interpreted as part of its name. The <em>parameter</em> is a shell parameter as described above <strong>PARAMETERS</strong>) or an array reference (<strong>Arrays</strong>).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>If the first character of <em>parameter</em> is an exclamation point (<strong>!</strong>), it introduces a level of variable indirection. <strong>Bash</strong> uses the value of the variable formed from the rest of <em>parameter</em> as the name of the variable; this variable is then expanded and that value is used in the rest of the substitution, rather than the value of <em>parameter</em> itself. This is known as <em>indirect expansion</em>. The exceptions to this are the expansions of ${<strong>!</strong><em>prefix</em><strong>*</strong>} and ${<strong>!</strong><em>name</em>[<em>@</em>]} described below. The exclamation point must immediately follow the left brace in order to introduce indirection.</p><p>In each of the cases below, <em>word</em> is subject to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.</p><p>When not performing substring expansion, using the forms documented below (e.g., <strong>:-</strong>), <strong>bash</strong> tests for a parameter that is unset or null.  Omitting the colon results in a test only for a parameter that is unset.</p>

    <p><strong>Substring Expansion</strong>. Expands to up to <em>length</em> characters of the value of <em>parameter</em> starting at the character specified by <em>offset</em>. If <em>parameter</em> is <strong>@</strong>, an indexed array subscripted by <strong>@</strong> or <strong>*</strong>, or an associative array name, the results differ as described below. If <em>length</em> is omitted, expands to the substring of the value of <em>parameter</em> starting at the character specified by <em>offset</em> and extending to the end of the value. <em>length</em> and <em>offset</em> are arithmetic expressions (see <small></small> <strong></strong> ARITHMETIC EVALUATION below).</p><p>If <em>offset</em> evaluates to a number less than zero, the value is used as an offset in characters from the end of the value of <em>parameter</em>. If <em>length</em> evaluates to a number less than zero, it is interpreted as an offset in characters from the end of the value of <em>parameter</em> rather than a number of characters, and the expansion is the characters between <em>offset</em> and that result. Note that a negative offset must be separated from the colon by at least one space to avoid being confused with the <strong>:-</strong> expansion.</p><p>If <em>parameter</em> is <strong>@</strong>, the result is <em>length</em> positional parameters beginning at <em>offset</em>. A negative <em>offset</em> is taken relative to one greater than the greatest positional parameter, so an offset of -1 evaluates to the last positional parameter. It is an expansion error if <em>length</em> evaluates to a number less than zero.</p><p>If <em>parameter</em> is an indexed array name subscripted by @ or *, the result is the <em>length</em> members of the array beginning with ${<em>parameter</em>[<em>offset</em>]}. A negative <em>offset</em> is taken relative to one greater than the maximum index of the specified array. It is an expansion error if <em>length</em> evaluates to a number less than zero.</p><p>Substring expansion applied to an associative array produces undefined results.</p><p>Substring indexing is zero-based unless the positional parameters are used, in which case the indexing starts at 1 by default. If <em>offset</em> is 0, and the positional parameters are used, <strong>$0</strong> is prefixed to the list.</p>

    <p><strong>Pattern substitution</strong>.

    <p><strong>Case modification</strong>. This expansion modifies the case of alphabetic characters in <em>parameter</em>. The <em>pattern</em> is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion. Each character in the expanded value of <em>parameter</em> is tested against <em>pattern</em>, and, if it matches the pattern, its case is converted. The pattern should not attempt to match more than one character. The <strong>^</strong> operator converts lowercase letters matching <em>pattern</em> to uppercase; the <strong>,</strong> operator converts matching uppercase letters to lowercase. The <strong>^^</strong> and <strong>,,</strong> expansions convert each matched character in the expanded value; the <strong>^</strong> and <strong>,</strong> expansions match and convert only the first character in the expanded value. If <em>pattern</em> is omitted, it is treated like a <strong>?</strong>, which matches every character. If <em>parameter</em> is <strong>@</strong> or <strong>*</strong>, the case modification operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list. If <em>parameter</em> is an array variable subscripted with <strong>@</strong> or <strong>*</strong>, the case modification operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.</p>

<h3>Command Substitution</h3>
<p><em>Command substitution</em> allows the output of a command to replace the command name.  There are two forms:</p><p><strong>$(</strong><em>command</em>\|<strong>)</strong></p><p>or</p><p><strong>&#96;</strong><em>command</em><strong>&#96;</strong></p><p><strong>Bash</strong> performs the expansion by executing <em>command</em> and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted. Embedded newlines are not deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting. The command substitution <strong>$(cat </strong><em>file</em><strong>)</strong> can be replaced by the equivalent but faster <strong>$(&lt; </strong><em>file</em><strong>)</strong>.</p><p>When the old-style backquote form of substitution is used, backslash retains its literal meaning except when followed by <strong>$</strong>, <strong>&#96;</strong>, or <strong>&#92;</strong>. The first backquote not preceded by a backslash terminates the command substitution. When using the $(\^<em>command</em>\|) form, all characters between the parentheses make up the command; none are treated specially.</p><p>Command substitutions may be nested.  To nest when using the backquoted form, escape the inner backquotes with backslashes.</p><p>If the substitution appears within double quotes, word splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the results.</p>
<h3>Arithmetic Expansion</h3>
<p>Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and the substitution of the result.  The format for arithmetic expansion is:</p><p><strong>$((</strong><em>expression</em><strong>))</strong></p><p>The <em>expression</em> is treated as if it were within double quotes, but a double quote inside the parentheses is not treated specially. All tokens in the expression undergo parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and quote removal. The result is treated as the arithmetic expression to be evaluated. Arithmetic expansions may be nested.</p><p>The evaluation is performed according to the rules listed below under <small></small> <strong>ARITHMETIC EVALUATION</strong>. If <em>expression</em> is invalid, <strong>bash</strong> prints a message indicating failure and no substitution occurs.</p>
<h3>Process Substitution</h3>
<p><em>Process substitution</em> is supported on systems that support named pipes (<em>FIFOs</em>) or the <strong>/dev/fd</strong> method of naming open files. It takes the form of <strong>&lt;(</strong><em>list\^</em><strong>)</strong> or <strong>&gt;(</strong><em>list\^</em><strong>)</strong>. The process <em>list</em> is run with its input or output connected to a <em>FIFO</em> or some file in <strong>/dev/fd</strong>.  The name of this file is passed as an argument to the current command as the result of the expansion.  If the <strong>&gt;(</strong><em>list\^</em><strong>)</strong> form is used, writing to the file will provide input for <em>list</em>.  If the <strong>&lt;(</strong><em>list\^</em><strong>)</strong> form is used, the file passed as an argument should be read to obtain the output of <em>list</em>.</p><p>When available, process substitution is performed simultaneously with parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.</p>
<h3>Word Splitting</h3>
<p>The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double quotes for <em>word splitting</em>.</p><p>The shell treats each character of <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> as a delimiter, and splits the results of the other expansions into words using these characters as field terminators. If <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> is unset, or its value is exactly <strong>&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;</strong>, the default, then sequences of <strong>&lt;space&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;tab&gt;</strong>, and <strong>&lt;newline&gt;</strong> at the beginning and end of the results of the previous expansions are ignored, and any sequence of <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> characters not at the beginning or end serves to delimit words. If <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> has a value other than the default, then sequences of the whitespace characters <strong>space</strong> and <strong>tab</strong> are ignored at the beginning and end of the word, as long as the whitespace character is in the value of <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> (an <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> whitespace character). Any character in <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> that is not <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> whitespace, along with any adjacent <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> whitespace characters, delimits a field. A sequence of <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> whitespace characters is also treated as a delimiter. If the value of <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> is null, no word splitting occurs.</p><p>Explicit null arguments (\^<strong>"\^"</strong> or \^<strong>&apos;\^&apos;</strong>\^) are retained. Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting from the expansion of parameters that have no values, are removed. If a parameter with no value is expanded within double quotes, a null argument results and is retained.</p><p>Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.</p>
<h3>Pathname Expansion</h3>
<p>After word splitting, unless the <strong>-f</strong> option has been set, <strong>bash</strong> scans each word for the characters <strong>*</strong>, <strong>?</strong>, and <strong>[</strong>. If one of these characters appears, then the word is regarded as a <em>pattern</em>, and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of filenames matching the pattern (see <small></small> <strong>Pattern Matching</strong> below). If no matching filenames are found, and the shell option <strong>nullglob</strong> is not enabled, the word is left unchanged. If the <strong>nullglob</strong> option is set, and no matches are found, the word is removed. If the <strong>failglob</strong> shell option is set, and no matches are found, an error message is printed and the command is not executed. If the shell option <strong>nocaseglob</strong> is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. When a pattern is used for pathname expansion, the character <strong>``.''</strong> at the start of a name or immediately following a slash must be matched explicitly, unless the shell option <strong>dotglob</strong> is set. When matching a pathname, the slash character must always be matched explicitly. In other cases, the <strong>``.''</strong> character is not treated specially. See the description of <strong>shopt</strong> below under <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> for a description of the <strong>nocaseglob</strong>, <strong>nullglob</strong>, <strong>failglob</strong>, and <strong>dotglob</strong> shell options.</p><p>The <small></small> <strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> shell variable may be used to restrict the set of filenames matching a <em>pattern</em>. If <small></small> <strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> is set, each matching filename that also matches one of the patterns in <small></small> <strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> is removed from the list of matches. The filenames <strong>``.''</strong> and <strong>``..''</strong> are always ignored when <small></small> <strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> is set and not null.  However, setting <small></small> <strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> to a non-null value has the effect of enabling the <strong>dotglob</strong> shell option, so all other filenames beginning with a <strong>``.''</strong> will match. To get the old behavior of ignoring filenames beginning with a <strong>``.''</strong>, make <strong>``.*''</strong> one of the patterns in <small></small> <strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong>. The <strong>dotglob</strong> option is disabled when <small></small> <strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> is unset.</p><p><strong>Pattern Matching</strong></p><p>Any character that appears in a pattern, other than the special pattern characters described below, matches itself.  The NUL character may not occur in a pattern.  A backslash escapes the following character; the escaping backslash is discarded when matching. The special pattern characters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally.</p><p>The special pattern characters have the following meanings:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>*</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Matches any string, including the null string. When the <strong>globstar</strong> shell option is enabled, and <strong>*</strong> is used in a pathname expansion context, two adjacent <strong>*</strong>s used as a single pattern will match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. If followed by a <strong>/</strong>, two adjacent <strong>*</strong>s will match only directories and subdirectories.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>?</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Matches any single character.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>[...]</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Matches any one of the enclosed characters.  A pair of characters separated by a hyphen denotes a <em>range expression</em>; any character that falls between those two characters, inclusive, using the current locale's collating sequence and character set, is matched.  If the first character following the <strong>[</strong> is a <strong>!</strong> or a <strong>^</strong> then any character not enclosed is matched. The sorting order of characters in range expressions is determined by the current locale and the values of the <small></small> <strong>LC_COLLATE</strong> or <small></small> <strong>LC_ALL</strong> shell variables, if set. To obtain the traditional interpretation of range expressions, where <strong>[a-d]</strong> is equivalent to <strong>[abcd]</strong>, set value of the <strong>LC_ALL</strong> shell variable to <strong>C</strong>, or enable the <strong>globasciiranges</strong> shell option. A <strong>-</strong> may be matched by including it as the first or last character in the set. A <strong>]</strong> may be matched by including it as the first character in the set.</p><p>Within <strong>[</strong> and <strong>]</strong>, <em>character classes</em> can be specified using the syntax <strong>[:</strong><em>class</em><strong>:]</strong>, where <em>class</em> is one of the following classes defined in the POSIX standard:</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p><strong></strong></p><p>A character class matches any character belonging to that class. The <strong>word</strong> character class matches letters, digits, and the character _.</p><p>Within <strong>[</strong> and <strong>]</strong>, an <em>equivalence class</em> can be specified using the syntax <strong>[=</strong><em>c</em><strong>=]</strong>, which matches all characters with the same collation weight (as defined by the current locale) as the character <em>c</em>.</p><p>Within <strong>[</strong> and <strong>]</strong>, the syntax <strong>[.</strong><em>symbol</em><strong>.]</strong> matches the collating symbol <em>symbol</em>.</p><p>If the <strong>extglob</strong> shell option is enabled using the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin, several extended pattern matching operators are recognized. In the following description, a <em>pattern-list</em> is a list of one or more patterns separated by a <strong>|</strong>. Composite patterns may be formed using one or more of the following sub-patterns:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>?(</strong>\^<em>pattern-list\^</em><strong>)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>*(</strong>\^<em>pattern-list\^</em><strong>)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>+(</strong>\^<em>pattern-list\^</em><strong>)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>@(</strong>\^<em>pattern-list\^</em><strong>)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Matches one of the given patterns</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>!(</strong>\^<em>pattern-list\^</em><strong>)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Matches anything except one of the given patterns</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>Quote Removal</h3>
<p>After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the characters <strong>&#92;</strong>, <strong>&apos;</strong>, and \^<strong>"</strong>\^ that did not result from one of the above expansions are removed.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">REDIRECTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Before a command is executed, its input and output may be <em>redirected</em> using a special notation interpreted by the shell. Redirection allows commands' file handles to be duplicated, opened, closed, made to refer to different files, and can change the files the command reads from and writes to. Redirection may also be used to modify file handles in the current shell execution environment. The following redirection operators may precede or appear anywhere within a <em>simple command</em> or may follow a <em>command</em>. Redirections are processed in the order they appear, from left to right.</p><p>Each redirection that may be preceded by a file descriptor number may instead be preceded by a word of the form {<em>varname</em>}. In this case, for each redirection operator except &gt;&- and &lt;&-, the shell will allocate a file descriptor greater than or equal to 10 and assign it to <em>varname</em>. If &gt;&- or &lt;&- is preceded by {<em>varname</em>}, the value of <em>varname</em> defines the file descriptor to close.</p><p>In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is omitted, and the first character of the redirection operator is <strong>&lt;</strong>, the redirection refers to the standard input (file descriptor 0).  If the first character of the redirection operator is <strong>&gt;</strong>, the redirection refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1).</p><p>The word following the redirection operator in the following descriptions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected to brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, quote removal, pathname expansion, and word splitting. If it expands to more than one word, <strong>bash</strong> reports an error.</p><p>Note that the order of redirections is significant.  For example, the command</p><p>ls <strong>&gt;</strong> dirlist 2<strong>&gt;&</strong>1</p><p>directs both standard output and standard error to the file <em>dirlist</em>, while the command</p><p>ls 2<strong>&gt;&</strong>1 <strong>&gt;</strong> dirlist</p><p>directs only the standard output to file <em>dirlist</em>, because the standard error was duplicated from the standard output before the standard output was redirected to <em>dirlist</em>.</p><p><strong>Bash</strong> handles several filenames specially when they are used in redirections, as described in the following table:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>/dev/fd/</strong><em>fd</em><strong></strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If <em>fd</em> is a valid integer, file descriptor <em>fd</em> is duplicated.</p>

  </dd>

</dl>
<p>A failure to open or create a file causes the redirection to fail.</p><p>Redirections using file descriptors greater than 9 should be used with care, as they may conflict with file descriptors the shell uses internally.</p><h3>Redirecting Input</h3>
<p>Redirection of input causes the file whose name results from the expansion of <em>word</em> to be opened for reading on file descriptor <em>n</em>, or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if <em>n</em> is not specified.</p><p>The general format for redirecting input is:</p><p>[<em>n</em>]<strong>&lt;</strong><em>word</em></p>
<h3>Redirecting Output</h3>
<p>Redirection of output causes the file whose name results from the expansion of <em>word</em> to be opened for writing on file descriptor <em>n</em>, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if <em>n</em> is not specified.  If the file does not exist it is created; if it does exist it is truncated to zero size.</p><p>The general format for redirecting output is:</p><p>[<em>n</em>]<strong>&gt;</strong><em>word</em></p><p>If the redirection operator is <strong>&gt;</strong>, and the <strong>noclobber</strong> option to the <strong>set</strong> builtin has been enabled, the redirection will fail if the file whose name results from the expansion of <em>word</em> exists and is a regular file. If the redirection operator is <strong>&gt;|</strong>, or the redirection operator is <strong>&gt;</strong> and the <strong>noclobber</strong> option to the <strong>set</strong> builtin command is not enabled, the redirection is attempted even if the file named by <em>word</em> exists.</p>
<h3>Appending Redirected Output</h3>
<p>Redirection of output in this fashion causes the file whose name results from the expansion of <em>word</em> to be opened for appending on file descriptor <em>n</em>, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if <em>n</em> is not specified.  If the file does not exist it is created.</p><p>The general format for appending output is:</p><p>[<em>n</em>]<strong>&gt;&gt;</strong><em>word</em></p>
<h3>Redirecting Standard Output and Standard Error</h3>
<p>This construct allows both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to be redirected to the file whose name is the expansion of <em>word</em>.</p><p>There are two formats for redirecting standard output and standard error:</p><p><strong>&&gt;</strong><em>word</em></p><p>and</p><p><strong>&gt;&</strong><em>word</em></p><p>Of the two forms, the first is preferred. This is semantically equivalent to</p><p><strong>&gt;</strong><em>word</em> 2<strong>&gt;&</strong>1</p><p>When using the second form, <em>word</em> may not expand to a number or <strong>-</strong>.  If it does, other redirection operators apply (see <strong>Duplicating File Descriptors</strong> below) for compatibility reasons.</p>
<h3>Appending Standard Output and Standard Error</h3>
<p>This construct allows both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to be appended to the file whose name is the expansion of <em>word</em>.</p><p>The format for appending standard output and standard error is:</p><p><strong>&&gt;&gt;</strong><em>word</em></p><p>This is semantically equivalent to</p><p><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong><em>word</em> 2<strong>&gt;&</strong>1</p><p>(see <strong>Duplicating File Descriptors</strong> below).</p>
<h3>Here Documents</h3>
<p>This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from the current source until a line containing only <em>delimiter</em> (with no trailing blanks) is seen.  All of the lines read up to that point are then used as the standard input for a command.</p><p>The format of here-documents is:</p>
<pre>
<strong>&lt;&lt;</strong>[<strong>-</strong>]<em>word</em>
        <em>here-document</em>
<em>delimiter</em>
</pre>
<p>No parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, or pathname expansion is performed on <em>word</em>. If any characters in <em>word</em> are quoted, the <em>delimiter</em> is the result of quote removal on <em>word</em>, and the lines in the here-document are not expanded. If <em>word</em> is unquoted, all lines of the here-document are subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, the character sequence <strong>&#92;&lt;newline&gt;</strong> is ignored, and <strong>&#92;</strong> must be used to quote the characters <strong>&#92;</strong>, <strong>$</strong>, and <strong>&#96;</strong>.</p><p>If the redirection operator is <strong>&lt;&lt;-</strong>, then all leading tab characters are stripped from input lines and the line containing <em>delimiter</em>. This allows here-documents within shell scripts to be indented in a natural fashion.</p>
<h3>Here Strings</h3>
<p>A variant of here documents, the format is:</p>
<pre>
<strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong><em>word</em>
</pre>
<p>The <em>word</em> undergoes brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal. Pathname expansion and word splitting are not performed. The result is supplied as a single string to the command on its standard input.</p>
<h3>Duplicating File Descriptors</h3>
<p>The redirection operator</p><p>[<em>n</em>]<strong>&lt;&</strong><em>word</em></p><p>is used to duplicate input file descriptors. If <em>word</em> expands to one or more digits, the file descriptor denoted by <em>n</em> is made to be a copy of that file descriptor. If the digits in <em>word</em> do not specify a file descriptor open for input, a redirection error occurs. If <em>word</em> evaluates to <strong>-</strong>, file descriptor <em>n</em> is closed.  If <em>n</em> is not specified, the standard input (file descriptor 0) is used.</p><p>The operator</p><p>[<em>n</em>]<strong>&gt;&</strong><em>word</em></p><p>is used similarly to duplicate output file descriptors.  If <em>n</em> is not specified, the standard output (file descriptor 1) is used. If the digits in <em>word</em> do not specify a file descriptor open for output, a redirection error occurs. If <em>word</em> evaluates to <strong>-</strong>, file descriptor <em>n</em> is closed. As a special case, if <em>n</em> is omitted, and <em>word</em> does not expand to one or more digits or <strong>-</strong>, the standard output and standard error are redirected as described previously.</p>
<h3>Moving File Descriptors</h3>
<p>The redirection operator</p><p>[<em>n</em>]<strong>&lt;&</strong><em>digit</em><strong>-</strong></p><p>moves the file descriptor <em>digit</em> to file descriptor <em>n</em>, or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if <em>n</em> is not specified. <em>digit</em> is closed after being duplicated to <em>n</em>.</p><p>Similarly, the redirection operator</p><p>[<em>n</em>]<strong>&gt;&</strong><em>digit</em><strong>-</strong></p><p>moves the file descriptor <em>digit</em> to file descriptor <em>n</em>, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if <em>n</em> is not specified.</p>
<h3>Opening File Descriptors for Reading and Writing</h3>
<p>The redirection operator</p><p>[<em>n</em>]<strong>&lt;&gt;</strong><em>word</em></p><p>causes the file whose name is the expansion of <em>word</em> to be opened for both reading and writing on file descriptor <em>n</em>, or on file descriptor 0 if <em>n</em> is not specified.  If the file does not exist, it is created.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">ALIASES</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><em>Aliases</em> allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple command. The shell maintains a list of aliases that may be set and unset with the <strong>alias</strong> and <strong>unalias</strong> builtin commands (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). The first word of each simple command, if unquoted, is checked to see if it has an alias.  If so, that word is replaced by the text of the alias. The characters <strong>/</strong>, <strong>$</strong>, <strong>&#96;</strong>, and <strong>=</strong> and any of the shell <em>metacharacters</em> or quoting characters listed above may not appear in an alias name. The replacement text may contain any valid shell input, including shell metacharacters. The first word of the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word that is identical to an alias being expanded is not expanded a second time. This means that one may alias <strong>ls</strong> to <strong>ls -F</strong>, for instance, and <strong>bash</strong> does not try to recursively expand the replacement text. If the last character of the alias value is a <em>blank</em>, then the next command word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.</p><p>Aliases are created and listed with the <strong>alias</strong> command, and removed with the <strong>unalias</strong> command.</p><p>There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text. If arguments are needed, a shell function should be used (see <small></small> <strong>FUNCTIONS</strong> below).</p><p>Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the <strong>expand_aliases</strong> shell option is set using <strong>shopt</strong> (see the description of <strong>shopt</strong> under <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below).</p><p>The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat confusing. <strong>Bash</strong> always reads at least one complete line of input before executing any of the commands on that line.  Aliases are expanded when a command is read, not when it is executed.  Therefore, an alias definition appearing on the same line as another command does not take effect until the next line of input is read. The commands following the alias definition on that line are not affected by the new alias. This behavior is also an issue when functions are executed. Aliases are expanded when a function definition is read, not when the function is executed, because a function definition is itself a compound command.  As a consequence, aliases defined in a function are not available until after that function is executed.  To be safe, always put alias definitions on a separate line, and do not use <strong>alias</strong> in compound commands.</p><p>For almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">FUNCTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>A shell function, defined as described above under <small></small> <strong>SHELL GRAMMAR</strong>, stores a series of commands for later execution. When the name of a shell function is used as a simple command name, the list of commands associated with that function name is executed. Functions are executed in the context of the current shell; no new process is created to interpret them (contrast this with the execution of a shell script). When a function is executed, the arguments to the function become the positional parameters during its execution. The special parameter <strong>#</strong> is updated to reflect the change.  Special parameter <strong>0</strong> is unchanged. The first element of the <small></small> <strong>FUNCNAME</strong> variable is set to the name of the function while the function is executing.</p><p>All other aspects of the shell execution environment are identical between a function and its caller with these exceptions:  the <small></small> <strong>DEBUG</strong> and <strong>RETURN</strong> traps (see the description of the <strong>trap</strong> builtin under <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below) are not inherited unless the function has been given the <strong>trace</strong> attribute (see the description of the <small></small> <strong>declare</strong> builtin below) or the <strong>-o functrace</strong> shell option has been enabled with the <strong>set</strong> builtin (in which case all functions inherit the <strong>DEBUG</strong> and <strong>RETURN</strong> traps), and the <small></small> <strong>ERR</strong> trap is not inherited unless the <strong>-o errtrace</strong> shell option has been enabled.</p><p>Variables local to the function may be declared with the <strong>local</strong> builtin command.  Ordinarily, variables and their values are shared between the function and its caller.</p><p>The <strong>FUNCNEST</strong> variable, if set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a maximum function nesting level.  Function invocations that exceed the limit cause the entire command to abort.</p><p>If the builtin command <strong>return</strong> is executed in a function, the function completes and execution resumes with the next command after the function call. Any command associated with the <strong>RETURN</strong> trap is executed before execution resumes. When a function completes, the values of the positional parameters and the special parameter <strong>#</strong> are restored to the values they had prior to the function's execution.</p><p>Function names and definitions may be listed with the <strong>-f</strong> option to the <strong>declare</strong> or <strong>typeset</strong> builtin commands.  The <strong>-F</strong> option to <strong>declare</strong> or <strong>typeset</strong> will list the function names only (and optionally the source file and line number, if the <strong>extdebug</strong> shell option is enabled). Functions may be exported so that subshells automatically have them defined with the <strong>-f</strong> option to the <strong>export</strong> builtin. A function definition may be deleted using the <strong>-f</strong> option to the <strong>unset</strong> builtin. Note that shell functions and variables with the same name may result in multiple identically-named entries in the environment passed to the shell's children. Care should be taken in cases where this may cause a problem.</p><p>Functions may be recursive. The <strong>FUNCNEST</strong> variable may be used to limit the depth of the function call stack and restrict the number of function invocations. By default, no limit is imposed on the number of recursive calls.</p>

<p>Shell variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is performed before the expression is evaluated. Within an expression, shell variables may also be referenced by name without using the parameter expansion syntax. A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates to 0 when referenced by name without using the parameter expansion syntax. The value of a variable is evaluated as an arithmetic expression when it is referenced, or when a variable which has been given the <em>integer</em> attribute using <strong>declare -i</strong> is assigned a value. A null value evaluates to 0. A shell variable need not have its <em>integer</em> attribute turned on to be used in an expression.</p><p>Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as octal numbers. A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal. Otherwise, numbers take the form [<em>base#</em>]n, where the optional <em>base</em> is a decimal number between 2 and 64 representing the arithmetic base, and <em>n</em> is a number in that base. If <em>base#</em> is omitted, then base 10 is used. When specifying <em>n</em>, the digits greater&lt; than 9 are represented by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _, in that order. If <em>base</em> is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and uppercase letters may be used interchangeably to represent numbers between 10 and 35.</p><p>Operators are evaluated in order of precedence.  Sub-expressions in parentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence rules above.</p>

<p>After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken.</p><p>If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it.  If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is invoked as described above in <small></small> <strong>FUNCTIONS</strong>. If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.  If a match is found, that builtin is invoked.</p><p>If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no slashes, <strong>bash</strong> searches each element of the <small></small> <strong>PATH</strong> for a directory containing an executable file by that name. <strong>Bash</strong> uses a hash table to remember the full pathnames of executable files (see <strong>hash</strong> under <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). A full search of the directories in <small></small> <strong>PATH</strong> is performed only if the command is not found in the hash table. If the search is unsuccessful, the shell searches for a defined shell function named <strong>command_not_found_handle</strong>. If that function exists, it is invoked with the original command and the original command's arguments as its arguments, and the function's exit status becomes the exit status of the shell. If that function is not defined, the shell prints an error message and returns an exit status of 127.</p><p>If the search is successful, or if the command name contains one or more slashes, the shell executes the named program in a separate execution environment. Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the remaining arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.</p><p>If this execution fails because the file is not in executable format, and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a <em>shell script</em>, a file containing shell commands.  A subshell is spawned to execute it.  This subshell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a new shell had been invoked to handle the script, with the exception that the locations of commands remembered by the parent (see <strong>hash</strong> below under <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong>) are retained by the child.</p><p>If the program is a file beginning with <strong>#!</strong>, the remainder of the first line specifies an interpreter for the program.  The shell executes the specified interpreter on operating systems that do not handle this executable format themselves.  The arguments to the interpreter consist of a single optional argument following the interpreter name on the first line of the program, followed by the name of the program, followed by the command arguments, if any.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">ENVIRONMENT</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the <em>environment</em>. This is a list of <em>name</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, of the form <em>name</em>=<em>value</em>.</p><p>The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment. On invocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter for each name found, automatically marking it for <em>export</em> to child processes.  Executed commands inherit the environment. The <strong>export</strong> and <strong>declare -x</strong> commands allow parameters and functions to be added to and deleted from the environment.  If the value of a parameter in the environment is modified, the new value becomes part of the environment, replacing the old.  The environment inherited by any executed command consists of the shell's initial environment, whose values may be modified in the shell, less any pairs removed by the <strong>unset</strong> command, plus any additions via the <strong>export</strong> and <strong>declare -x</strong> commands.</p><p>The environment for any <em>simple command</em> or function may be augmented temporarily by prefixing it with parameter assignments, as described above in <small></small> <strong>PARAMETERS</strong>. These assignment statements affect only the environment seen by that command.</p><p>If the <strong>-k</strong> option is set (see the <strong>set</strong> builtin command below), then <em>all</em> parameter assignments are placed in the environment for a command, not just those that precede the command name.</p><p>When <strong>bash</strong> invokes an external command, the variable <strong>_</strong> is set to the full filename of the command and passed to that command in its environment.</p>

<p>The exit status of an executed command is the value returned by the <em>waitpid</em> system call or equivalent function.  Exit statuses fall between 0 and 255, though, as explained below, the shell may use values above 125 specially.  Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands are also limited to this range. Under certain circumstances, the shell will use special values to indicate specific failure modes.</p><p>For the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded.  An exit status of zero indicates success.  A non-zero exit status indicates failure. When a command terminates on a fatal signal <em>N</em>, <strong>bash</strong> uses the value of 128+<em>N</em> as the exit status.</p><p>If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127.  If a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.</p><p>If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection, the exit status is greater than zero.</p><p>Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (<em>true</em>) if successful, and non-zero (<em>false</em>) if an error occurs while they execute. All builtins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage.</p><p><strong>Bash</strong> itself returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-zero value.

In all cases, <strong>bash</strong> ignores <small></small> <strong>SIGQUIT</strong>.

To prevent the shell from sending the signal to a particular job, it should be removed from the jobs table with the <strong>disown</strong> builtin (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below) or marked to not receive <small></small> <strong>SIGHUP</strong> using <strong>disown -h</strong>.</p><p>If the <strong>huponexit</strong> shell option has been set with <strong>shopt</strong>, <strong>bash</strong> sends a <small></small> <strong>SIGHUP</strong> to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.</p><p>If <strong>bash</strong> is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal for which a trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until the command completes. When <strong>bash</strong> is waiting for an asynchronous command via the <strong>wait</strong> builtin, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been set will cause the <strong>wait</strong> builtin to return immediately with an exit status greater than 128, immediately after which the trap is executed.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">JOB CONTROL</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><em>Job control</em> refers to the ability to selectively stop (<em>suspend</em>) the execution of processes and continue (<em>resume</em>) their execution at a later point.  A user typically employs this facility via an interactive interface supplied jointly by the operating system kernel's terminal driver and <strong>bash</strong>.</p><p>The shell associates a <em>job</em> with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of currently executing jobs, which may be listed with the <strong>jobs</strong> command.  When <strong>bash</strong> starts a job asynchronously (in the <em>background</em>), it prints a line that looks like:</p><p>[1] 25647</p><p>indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID of the last process in the pipeline associated with this job is 25647. All of the processes in a single pipeline are members of the same job. <strong>Bash</strong> uses the <em>job</em> abstraction as the basis for job control.</p><p>To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job control, the operating system maintains the notion of a <em>current terminal</em> process group ID.  Members of this process group (processes whose process group ID is equal to the current terminal process group ID) receive keyboard-generated signals such as <small></small> <strong>SIGINT</strong>. These processes are said to be in the <em>foreground</em>. <em>Background</em> processes are those whose process group ID differs from the terminal's; such processes are immune to keyboard-generated signals. Only foreground processes are allowed to read from or, if the user so specifies with stty tostop, write to the terminal. Background processes which attempt to read from (write to when stty tostop is in effect) the terminal are sent a <small></small> <strong>SIGTTIN (SIGTTOU)</strong> signal by the kernel's terminal driver, which, unless caught, suspends the process.</p><p>If the operating system on which <strong>bash</strong> is running supports job control, <strong>bash</strong> contains facilities to use it. Typing the <em>suspend</em> character (typically <strong>^Z</strong>, Control-Z) while a process is running causes that process to be stopped and returns control to <strong>bash</strong>. Typing the <em>delayed suspend</em> character (typically <strong>^Y</strong>, Control-Y) causes the process to be stopped when it attempts to read input from the terminal, and control to be returned to <strong>bash</strong>. The user may then manipulate the state of this job, using the <strong>bg</strong> command to continue it in the background, the <strong>fg</strong> command to continue it in the foreground, or the <strong>kill</strong> command to kill it.  A <strong>^Z</strong> takes effect immediately, and has the additional side effect of causing pending output and typeahead to be discarded.</p><p>There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell. The character <strong>%</strong> introduces a job specification (<em>jobspec</em>).  Job number <em>n</em> may be referred to as <strong>%n</strong>. A job may also be referred to using a prefix of the name used to start it, or using a substring that appears in its command line. For example, <strong>%ce</strong> refers to a stopped <strong>ce</strong> job.  If a prefix matches more than one job, <strong>bash</strong> reports an error.  Using <strong>%?ce</strong>, on the other hand, refers to any job containing the string <strong>ce</strong> in its command line.  If the substring matches more than one job, <strong>bash</strong> reports an error.  The symbols <strong>%%</strong> and <strong>%+</strong> refer to the shell's notion of the <em>current job</em>, which is the last job stopped while it was in the foreground or started in the background. The <em>previous job</em> may be referenced using <strong>%-</strong>. If there is only a single job, <strong>%+</strong> and <strong>%-</strong> can both be used to refer to that job. In output pertaining to jobs (e.g., the output of the <strong>jobs</strong> command), the current job is always flagged with a <strong>+</strong>, and the previous job with a <strong>-</strong>. A single % (with no accompanying job specification) also refers to the current job.</p><p>Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground: <strong>%1</strong> is a synonym for <strong>``fg %1''</strong>, bringing job 1 from the background into the foreground. Similarly, <strong>``%1 &''</strong> resumes job 1 in the background, equivalent to <strong>``bg %1''</strong>.</p><p>The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state. Normally, <strong>bash</strong> waits until it is about to print a prompt before reporting changes in a job's status so as to not interrupt any other output.  If the <strong>-b</strong> option to the <strong>set</strong> builtin command is enabled, <strong>bash</strong> reports such changes immediately. Any trap on <small></small> <strong>SIGCHLD</strong> is executed for each child that exits.</p><p>If an attempt to exit <strong>bash</strong> is made while jobs are stopped (or, if the <strong>checkjobs</strong> shell option has been enabled using the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin, running), the shell prints a warning message, and, if the <strong>checkjobs</strong> option is enabled, lists the jobs and their statuses. The <strong>jobs</strong> command may then be used to inspect their status. If a second attempt to exit is made without an intervening command, the shell does not print another warning, and any stopped jobs are terminated.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">PROMPTING</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>When executing interactively, <strong>bash</strong> displays the primary prompt <small></small> <strong>PS1</strong> when it is ready to read a command, and the secondary prompt <small></small> <strong>PS2</strong> when it needs more input to complete a command. <strong>Bash</strong> allows these prompt strings to be customized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special characters that are decoded as follows:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>

<p>The command number and the history number are usually different: the history number of a command is its position in the history list, which may include commands restored from the history file (see <small></small> <strong>HISTORY</strong> below), while the command number is the position in the sequence of commands executed during the current shell session. After the string is decoded, it is expanded via parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal, subject to the value of the <strong>promptvars</strong> shell option (see the description of the <strong>shopt</strong> command under <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below).</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">READLINE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>This is the library that handles reading input when using an interactive shell, unless the <strong>--noediting</strong> option is given at shell invocation. Line editing is also used when using the <strong>-e</strong> option to the <strong>read</strong> builtin. By default, the line editing commands are similar to those of Emacs. A vi-style line editing interface is also available. Line editing can be enabled at any time using the <strong>-o emacs</strong> or <strong>-o vi</strong> options to the <strong>set</strong> builtin (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). To turn off line editing after the shell is running, use the <strong>+o emacs</strong> or <strong>+o vi</strong> options to the <strong>set</strong> builtin.</p><h3>Readline Notation</h3>
<p>In this section, the Emacs-style notation is used to denote keystrokes.  Control keys are denoted by C-<em>key</em>, e.g., C-n means Control-N.  Similarly, <em>meta</em> keys are denoted by M-<em>key</em>, so M-x means Meta-X.  (On keyboards without a <em>meta</em> key, M-<em>x</em> means ESC <em>x</em>, i.e., press the Escape key then the <em>x</em> key.  This makes ESC the <em>meta prefix</em>. The combination M-C-<em>x</em> means ESC-Control-<em>x</em>, or press the Escape key then hold the Control key while pressing the <em>x</em> key.)</p><p>Readline commands may be given numeric <em>arguments</em>, which normally act as a repeat count. Sometimes, however, it is the sign of the argument that is significant. Passing a negative argument to a command that acts in the forward direction (e.g., <strong>kill-line</strong>) causes that command to act in a backward direction. Commands whose behavior with arguments deviates from this are noted below.</p><p>When a command is described as <em>killing</em> text, the text deleted is saved for possible future retrieval (<em>yanking</em>).  The killed text is saved in a <em>kill ring</em>.  Consecutive kills cause the text to be accumulated into one unit, which can be yanked all at once. Commands which do not kill text separate the chunks of text on the kill ring.</p>
<h3>Readline Initialization</h3>
<p>Readline is customized by putting commands in an initialization file (the <em>inputrc</em> file). The name of this file is taken from the value of the <small></small> <strong>INPUTRC</strong> variable.  If that variable is unset, the default is <em>~/.inputrc</em>. When a program which uses the readline library starts up, the initialization file is read, and the key bindings and variables are set. There are only a few basic constructs allowed in the readline initialization file. Blank lines are ignored. Lines beginning with a <strong>#</strong> are comments. Lines beginning with a <strong>$</strong> indicate conditional constructs. Other lines denote key bindings and variable settings.</p><p>The default key-bindings may be changed with an <em>inputrc</em> file. Other programs that use this library may add their own commands and bindings.</p><p>For example, placing</p><p>M-Control-u: universal-argument</p><p>or</p><p>C-Meta-u: universal-argument</p><p>into the <em>inputrc</em> would make M-C-u execute the readline command <em>universal-argument</em>.</p><p>The following symbolic character names are recognized: <em>RUBOUT</em>, <em>DEL</em>, <em>ESC</em>, <em>LFD</em>, <em>NEWLINE</em>, <em>RET</em>, <em>RETURN</em>, <em>SPC</em>, <em>SPACE</em>, and <em>TAB</em>.</p><p>In addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound to a string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a <em>macro</em>).</p>
<h3>Readline Key Bindings</h3>
<p>The syntax for controlling key bindings in the <em>inputrc</em> file is simple.  All that is required is the name of the command or the text of a macro and a key sequence to which it should be bound. The name may be specified in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with <em>Meta-</em> or <em>Control-</em> prefixes, or as a key sequence.</p><p>When using the form <strong>keyname</strong>:\^<em>function-name</em> or <em>macro</em>, <em>keyname</em> is the name of a key spelled out in English.  For example:</p><p>Control-u: universal-argument</p><p>Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word</p><p>Control-o: "&gt; output"</p><p>In the above example, <em>C-u</em> is bound to the function <strong>universal-argument</strong>, <em>M-DEL</em> is bound to the function <strong>backward-kill-word</strong>, and <em>C-o</em> is bound to run the macro expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the text into the line).</p><p>In the second form, <strong>"keyseq"</strong>:\^<em>function-name</em> or <em>macro</em>, <strong>keyseq</strong> differs from <strong>keyname</strong> above in that strings denoting an entire key sequence may be specified by placing the sequence within double quotes.  Some GNU Emacs style key escapes can be used, as in the following example, but the symbolic character names are not recognized.</p><p>"&#92;C-u": universal-argument</p><p>"&#92;C-x&#92;C-r": re-read-init-file</p><p>"&#92;e[11~": "Function Key 1"</p><p>In this example, <em>C-u</em> is again bound to the function <strong>universal-argument</strong>. <em>C-x C-r</em> is bound to the function <strong>re-read-init-file</strong>, and <em>ESC [ 1 1 ~</em> is bound to insert the text</p><p>The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences is</p>

  </dd>

</dl>
<p>When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be used to indicate a macro definition. Unquoted text is assumed to be a function name. In the macro body, the backslash escapes described above are expanded. Backslash will quote any other character in the macro text, including " and &apos;.</p><p><strong>Bash</strong> allows the current readline key bindings to be displayed or modified with the <strong>bind</strong> builtin command.  The editing mode may be switched during interactive use by using the <strong>-o</strong> option to the <strong>set</strong> builtin command (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below).</p>
<h3>Readline Variables</h3>
<p>Readline has variables that can be used to further customize its behavior.  A variable may be set in the <em>inputrc</em> file with a statement of the form</p><p><strong>set</strong> <em>variable-name</em> <em>value</em></p><p>Except where noted, readline variables can take the values <strong>On</strong> or <strong>Off</strong> (without regard to case). Unrecognized variable names are ignored. When a variable value is read, empty or null values, "on" (case-insensitive), and "1" are equivalent to <strong>On</strong>.  All other values are equivalent to <strong>Off</strong>. The variables and their default values are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bell-style (audible)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Controls what happens when readline wants to ring the terminal bell. If set to <strong>none</strong>, readline never rings the bell.  If set to <strong>visible</strong>, readline uses a visible bell if one is available. If set to <strong>audible</strong>, readline attempts to ring the terminal's bell.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bind-tty-special-chars (On)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline attempts to bind the control characters treated specially by the kernel's terminal driver to their readline equivalents.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>colored-stats (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline displays possible completions using different colors to indicate their file type. The color definitions are taken from the value of the <strong>LS_COLORS</strong> environment variable.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>comment-begin (``#'')</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The length in characters of the common prefix of a list of possible completions that is displayed without modification.  When set to a value greater than zero, common prefixes longer than this value are replaced with an ellipsis when displaying possible completions.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>completion-query-items (100)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This determines when the user is queried about viewing the number of possible completions generated by the <strong>possible-completions</strong> command. It may be set to any integer value greater than or equal to zero.  If the number of possible completions is greater than or equal to the value of this variable, the user is asked whether or not he wishes to view them; otherwise they are simply listed on the terminal.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>convert-meta (On)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will convert characters with the eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and prefixing an escape character (in effect, using escape as the <em>meta prefix</em>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>disable-completion (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will inhibit word completion.  Completion characters will be inserted into the line as if they had been mapped to <strong>self-insert</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>editing-mode (emacs)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Controls whether readline begins with a set of key bindings similar to <em>Emacs</em> or <em>vi</em>. <strong>editing-mode</strong> can be set to either <strong>emacs</strong> or <strong>vi</strong>.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>enable-keypad (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will try to enable the application keypad when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable the arrow keys.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>enable-meta-key (On)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will try to enable any meta modifier key the terminal claims to support when it is called.  On many terminals, the meta key is used to send eight-bit characters.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>expand-tilde (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, tilde expansion is performed when readline attempts word completion.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>history-size (0)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the maximum number of history entries saved in the history list. If set to zero, any existing history entries are deleted and no new entries are saved. If set to a value less than zero, the number of history entries is not limited. By default, the number of history entries is not limited.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>horizontal-scroll-mode (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When set to <strong>On</strong>, makes readline use a single line for display, scrolling the input horizontally on a single screen line when it becomes longer than the screen width rather than wrapping to a new line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>input-meta (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will enable eight-bit input (that is, it will not strip the high bit from the characters it reads), regardless of what the terminal claims it can support.  The name <strong>meta-flag</strong> is a synonym for this variable.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>isearch-terminators (``C-[C-J'')</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The string of characters that should terminate an incremental search without subsequently executing the character as a command. If this variable has not been given a value, the characters <em>ESC</em> and <em>C-J</em> will terminate an incremental search.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>keymap (emacs)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the current readline keymap.  The set of valid keymap names is <em>emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi,</em> vi-command, and <em>vi-insert</em>. <em>vi</em> is equivalent to <em>vi-command</em>; <em>emacs</em> is equivalent to <em>emacs-standard</em>.  The default value is <em>emacs</em>; the value of <strong>editing-mode</strong> also affects the default keymap.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>keyseq-timeout (500)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies the duration <em>readline</em> will wait for a character when reading an ambiguous key sequence (one that can form a complete key sequence using the input read so far, or can take additional input to complete a longer key sequence). If no input is received within the timeout, <em>readline</em> will use the shorter but complete key sequence. The value is specified in milliseconds, so a value of 1000 means that <em>readline</em> will wait one second for additional input. If this variable is set to a value less than or equal to zero, or to a non-numeric value, <em>readline</em> will wait until another key is pressed to decide which key sequence to complete.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>mark-directories (On)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, completed directory names have a slash appended.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>mark-modified-lines (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, history lines that have been modified are displayed with a preceding asterisk (<strong>*</strong>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>mark-symlinked-directories (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, completed names which are symbolic links to directories have a slash appended (subject to the value of <strong>mark-directories</strong>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>match-hidden-files (On)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This variable, when set to <strong>On</strong>, causes readline to match files whose names begin with a `.' (hidden files) when performing filename completion. If set to <strong>Off</strong>, the leading `.' must be supplied by the user in the filename to be completed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>menu-complete-display-prefix (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, menu completion displays the common prefix of the list of possible completions (which may be empty) before cycling through the list.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>output-meta (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will display characters with the eighth bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>page-completions (On)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline uses an internal <em>more</em>-like pager to display a screenful of possible completions at a time.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>print-completions-horizontally (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will display completions with matches sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the screen.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>revert-all-at-newline (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will undo all changes to history lines before returning when <strong>accept-line</strong> is executed.  By default, history lines may be modified and retain individual undo lists across calls to <strong>readline</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>show-all-if-ambiguous (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.  If set to <strong>On</strong>, words which have more than one possible completion cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>show-all-if-unmodified (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This alters the default behavior of the completion functions in a fashion similar to <strong>show-all-if-ambiguous</strong>. If set to <strong>On</strong>, words which have more than one possible completion without any possible partial completion (the possible completions don't share a common prefix) cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>show-mode-in-prompt (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, add a character to the beginning of the prompt indicating the editing mode: emacs (@), vi command (:) or vi insertion (+).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>skip-completed-text (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, this alters the default completion behavior when inserting a single match into the line.  It's only active when performing completion in the middle of a word.  If enabled, readline does not insert characters from the completion that match characters after point in the word being completed, so portions of the word following the cursor are not duplicated.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>visible-stats (Off)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, a character denoting a file's type as reported by <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a> is appended to the filename when listing possible completions.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>Readline Conditional Constructs</h3>
<p>Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional compilation features of the C preprocessor which allows key bindings and variable settings to be performed as the result of tests.  There are four parser directives used.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    \fB$if\fP
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <strong>$if</strong> construct allows bindings to be made based on the editing mode, the terminal being used, or the application using readline.  The text of the test extends to the end of the line; no characters are required to isolate it.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    \fBmode\fP
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <strong>mode=</strong> form of the <strong>$if</strong> directive is used to test whether readline is in emacs or vi mode. This may be used in conjunction with the <strong>set keymap</strong> command, for instance, to set bindings in the <em>emacs-standard</em> and <em>emacs-ctlx</em> keymaps only if readline is starting out in emacs mode.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    \fBterm\fP
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <strong>term=</strong> form may be used to include terminal-specific key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side of the <strong>=</strong> is tested against the both full name of the terminal and the portion of the terminal name before the first <strong>-</strong>.  This allows <em>sun</em> to match both <em>sun</em> and <em>sun-cmd</em>, for instance.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    \fBapplication\fP
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <strong>application</strong> construct is used to include application-specific settings.  Each program using the readline library sets the <em>application name</em>, and an initialization file can test for a particular value. This could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for a specific program.  For instance, the following command adds a key sequence that quotes the current or previous word in <strong>bash</strong>:</p>
<pre>
<strong>$if</strong> Bash
# Quote the current or previous word
"&#92;C-xq": "&#92;eb&#92;"&#92;ef&#92;""
<strong>$endif</strong>
</pre>

  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    \fB$endif\fP
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an <strong>$if</strong> command.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    \fB$else\fP
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Commands in this branch of the <strong>$if</strong> directive are executed if the test fails.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    \fB$include\fP
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This directive takes a single filename as an argument and reads commands and bindings from that file.  For example, the following directive would read <em>/etc/inputrc</em>:</p>
<pre>
<strong>$include</strong> \^ <em>/etc/inputrc</em>
</pre>

  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>Searching</h3>
<p>Readline provides commands for searching through the command history (see <small></small> <strong>HISTORY</strong> below) for lines containing a specified string. There are two search modes: <em>incremental</em> and <em>non-incremental</em>.</p><p>Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the search string. As each character of the search string is typed, readline displays the next entry from the history matching the string typed so far. An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to find the desired history entry. The characters present in the value of the <strong>isearch-terminators</strong> variable are used to terminate an incremental search. If that variable has not been assigned a value the Escape and Control-J characters will terminate an incremental search. Control-G will abort an incremental search and restore the original line. When the search is terminated, the history entry containing the search string becomes the current line.</p><p>To find other matching entries in the history list, type Control-S or Control-R as appropriate. This will search backward or forward in the history for the next entry matching the search string typed so far. Any other key sequence bound to a readline command will terminate the search and execute that command. For instance, a <em>newline</em> will terminate the search and accept the line, thereby executing the command from the history list.</p><p>Readline remembers the last incremental search string.  If two Control-Rs are typed without any intervening characters defining a new search string, any remembered search string is used.</p><p>Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before starting to search for matching history lines.  The search string may be typed by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.</p>
<h3>Readline Command Names</h3>
<p>The following is a list of the names of the commands and the default key sequences to which they are bound. Command names without an accompanying key sequence are unbound by default. In the following descriptions, <em>point</em> refers to the current cursor position, and <em>mark</em> refers to a cursor position saved by the <strong>set-mark</strong> command. The text between the point and mark is referred to as the <em>region</em>.</p>

    <p>Toggle overwrite mode.  With an explicit positive numeric argument, switches to overwrite mode.  With an explicit non-positive numeric argument, switches to insert mode.  This command affects only <strong>emacs</strong> mode; <strong>vi</strong> mode does overwrite differently. Each call to <em>readline()</em> starts in insert mode. In overwrite mode, characters bound to <strong>self-insert</strong> replace the text at point rather than pushing the text to the right. Characters bound to <strong>backward-delete-char</strong> replace the character before point with a space.  By default, this command is unbound.</p>

As a special case, if this command is immediately followed by a character that is neither a digit or minus sign, the argument count for the next command is multiplied by four. The argument count is initially one, so executing this function the first time makes the argument count four, a second time makes the argument count sixteen, and so on.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>complete (TAB)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Attempt to perform completion on the text before point. <strong>Bash</strong> attempts completion treating the text as a variable (if the text begins with <strong>$</strong>), username (if the text begins with <strong>~</strong>), hostname (if the text begins with <strong>@</strong>), or command (including aliases and functions) in turn.

<h3>Programmable Completion</h3>
<p>When word completion is attempted for an argument to a command for which a completion specification (a <em>compspec</em>) has been defined using the <strong>complete</strong> builtin (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below), the programmable completion facilities are invoked.</p><p>First, the command name is identified. If the command word is the empty string (completion attempted at the beginning of an empty line), any compspec defined with the <strong>-E</strong> option to <strong>complete</strong> is used. If a compspec has been defined for that command, the compspec is used to generate the list of possible completions for the word. If the command word is a full pathname, a compspec for the full pathname is searched for first. If no compspec is found for the full pathname, an attempt is made to find a compspec for the portion following the final slash. If those searches do not result in a compspec, any compspec defined with the <strong>-D</strong> option to <strong>complete</strong> is used as the default.</p><p>Once a compspec has been found, it is used to generate the list of matching words. If a compspec is not found, the default <strong>bash</strong> completion as described above under <strong>Completing</strong> is performed.</p><p>First, the actions specified by the compspec are used. Only matches which are prefixed by the word being completed are returned. When the <strong>-f</strong> or <strong>-d</strong> option is used for filename or directory name completion, the shell variable <small></small> <strong>FIGNORE</strong> is used to filter the matches.</p><p>Any completions specified by a pathname expansion pattern to the <strong>-G</strong> option are generated next. The words generated by the pattern need not match the word being completed. The <small></small> <strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> shell variable is not used to filter the matches, but the <small></small> <strong>FIGNORE</strong> variable is used.</p><p>Next, the string specified as the argument to the <strong>-W</strong> option is considered. The string is first split using the characters in the <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> special variable as delimiters. Shell quoting is honored. Each word is then expanded using brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, as described above under <small></small> <strong>EXPANSION</strong>. The results are split using the rules described above under <strong>Word Splitting</strong>. The results of the expansion are prefix-matched against the word being completed, and the matching words become the possible completions.</p><p>After these matches have been generated, any shell function or command specified with the <strong>-F</strong> and <strong>-C</strong> options is invoked. When the command or function is invoked, the <small></small> <strong>COMP_LINE</strong>, <small></small> <strong>COMP_POINT</strong>, <small></small> <strong>COMP_KEY</strong>, and <small></small> <strong>COMP_TYPE</strong> variables are assigned values as described above under <strong>Shell Variables</strong>. If a shell function is being invoked, the <small></small> <strong>COMP_WORDS</strong> and <small></small> <strong>COMP_CWORD</strong> variables are also set. When the function or command is invoked, the first argument (<strong>$1</strong>) is the name of the command whose arguments are being completed, the second argument (<strong>$2</strong>) is the word being completed, and the third argument (<strong>$3</strong>) is the word preceding the word being completed on the current command line. No filtering of the generated completions against the word being completed is performed; the function or command has complete freedom in generating the matches.</p><p>Any function specified with <strong>-F</strong> is invoked first. The function may use any of the shell facilities, including the <strong>compgen</strong> builtin described below, to generate the matches. It must put the possible completions in the <small></small> <strong>COMPREPLY</strong> array variable, one per array element.</p><p>Next, any command specified with the <strong>-C</strong> option is invoked in an environment equivalent to command substitution. It should print a list of completions, one per line, to the standard output. Backslash may be used to escape a newline, if necessary.</p><p>After all of the possible completions are generated, any filter specified with the <strong>-X</strong> option is applied to the list. The filter is a pattern as used for pathname expansion; a <strong>&</strong> in the pattern is replaced with the text of the word being completed. A literal <strong>&</strong> may be escaped with a backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting a match. Any completion that matches the pattern will be removed from the list. A leading <strong>!</strong> negates the pattern; in this case any completion not matching the pattern will be removed.</p><p>Finally, any prefix and suffix specified with the <strong>-P</strong> and <strong>-S</strong> options are added to each member of the completion list, and the result is returned to the readline completion code as the list of possible completions.</p><p>If the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches, and the <strong>-o dirnames</strong> option was supplied to <strong>complete</strong> when the compspec was defined, directory name completion is attempted.</p><p>If the <strong>-o plusdirs</strong> option was supplied to <strong>complete</strong> when the compspec was defined, directory name completion is attempted and any matches are added to the results of the other actions.</p><p>By default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates is returned to the completion code as the full set of possible completions. The default <strong>bash</strong> completions are not attempted, and the readline default of filename completion is disabled. If the <strong>-o bashdefault</strong> option was supplied to <strong>complete</strong> when the compspec was defined, the <strong>bash</strong> default completions are attempted if the compspec generates no matches. If the <strong>-o default</strong> option was supplied to <strong>complete</strong> when the compspec was defined, readline's default completion will be performed if the compspec (and, if attempted, the default <strong>bash</strong> completions) generate no matches.</p><p>When a compspec indicates that directory name completion is desired, the programmable completion functions force readline to append a slash to completed names which are symbolic links to directories, subject to the value of the <strong>mark-directories</strong> readline variable, regardless of the setting of the <strong>mark-symlinked-directories</strong> readline variable.</p><p>There is some support for dynamically modifying completions.  This is most useful when used in combination with a default completion specified with <strong>complete -D</strong>. It's possible for shell functions executed as completion handlers to indicate that completion should be retried by returning an exit status of 124.  If a shell function returns 124, and changes the compspec associated with the command on which completion is being attempted (supplied as the first argument when the function is executed), programmable completion restarts from the beginning, with an attempt to find a new compspec for that command.  This allows a set of completions to be built dynamically as completion is attempted, rather than being loaded all at once.</p><p>For instance, assuming that there is a library of compspecs, each kept in a file corresponding to the name of the command, the following default completion function would load completions dynamically:</p><p>_completion_loader()</p><p>{</p><p>	. "/etc/bash_completion.d/$1.sh" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1 && return 124</p><p>}</p><p>complete -D -F _completion_loader -o bashdefault -o default</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">HISTORY</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>When the <strong>-o history</strong> option to the <strong>set</strong> builtin is enabled, the shell provides access to the <em>command history</em>, the list of commands previously typed. The value of the <small></small> <strong>HISTSIZE</strong> variable is used as the number of commands to save in a history list. The text of the last <small></small> <strong>HISTSIZE</strong> commands (default 500) is saved.  The shell stores each command in the history list prior to parameter and variable expansion (see <small></small> <strong>EXPANSION</strong> above) but after history expansion is performed, subject to the values of the shell variables <small></small> <strong>HISTIGNORE</strong> and <small></small> <strong>HISTCONTROL</strong>.</p><p>On startup, the history is initialized from the file named by the variable <small></small> <strong>HISTFILE</strong> (default <em>~/.bash_history</em>). The file named by the value of <small></small> <strong>HISTFILE</strong> is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than the number of lines specified by the value of <small></small> <strong>HISTFILESIZE</strong>. If <strong>HISTFILESIZE</strong> is unset, or set to null, a non-numeric value, or a numeric value less than zero, the history file is not truncated. When the history file is read, lines beginning with the history comment character followed immediately by a digit are interpreted as timestamps for the preceding history line. These timestamps are optionally displayed depending on the value of the <small></small> <strong>HISTTIMEFORMAT</strong> variable. When a shell with history enabled exits, the last <small></small> <strong>$HISTSIZE</strong> lines are copied from the history list to <small></small> <strong>$HISTFILE</strong>. If the <strong>histappend</strong> shell option is enabled (see the description of <strong>shopt</strong> under <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below), the lines are appended to the history file, otherwise the history file is overwritten. If <small></small> <strong>HISTFILE</strong> is unset, or if the history file is unwritable, the history is not saved. If the <small></small> <strong>HISTTIMEFORMAT</strong> variable is set, time stamps are written to the history file, marked with the history comment character, so they may be preserved across shell sessions. This uses the history comment character to distinguish timestamps from other history lines. After saving the history, the history file is truncated to contain no more than <small></small> <strong>HISTFILESIZE</strong> lines.  If <small></small> <strong>HISTFILESIZE</strong> is unset, or set to null, a non-numeric value, or a numeric value less than zero, the history file is not truncated.</p><p>The builtin command <strong>fc</strong> (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below) may be used to list or edit and re-execute a portion of the history list. The <strong>history</strong> builtin may be used to display or modify the history list and manipulate the history file. When using command-line editing, search commands are available in each editing mode that provide access to the history list.</p><p>The shell allows control over which commands are saved on the history list.  The <small></small> <strong>HISTCONTROL</strong> and <small></small> <strong>HISTIGNORE</strong> variables may be set to cause the shell to save only a subset of the commands entered. The <strong>cmdhist</strong> shell option, if enabled, causes the shell to attempt to save each line of a multi-line command in the same history entry, adding semicolons where necessary to preserve syntactic correctness. The <strong>lithist</strong> shell option causes the shell to save the command with embedded newlines instead of semicolons.  See the description of the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin below under <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> for information on setting and unsetting shell options.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">HISTORY EXPANSION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar to the history expansion in <strong>csh.</strong> This section describes what syntax features are available.  This feature is enabled by default for interactive shells, and can be disabled using the <strong>+H</strong> option to the <strong>set</strong> builtin command (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below).  Non-interactive shells do not perform history expansion by default.</p><p>History expansions introduce words from the history list into the input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to a previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous commands quickly.</p><p>History expansion is performed immediately after a complete line is read, before the shell breaks it into words. It takes place in two parts. The first is to determine which line from the history list to use during substitution. The second is to select portions of that line for inclusion into the current one. The line selected from the history is the <em>event</em>, and the portions of that line that are acted upon are <em>words</em>. Various <em>modifiers</em> are available to manipulate the selected words. The line is broken into words in the same fashion as when reading input, so that several <em>metacharacter</em>-separated words surrounded by quotes are considered one word. History expansions are introduced by the appearance of the history expansion character, which is \^<strong>!</strong>\^ by default. Only backslash (\^<strong>&#92;</strong>\^) and single quotes can quote the history expansion character.</p><p>Several characters inhibit history expansion if found immediately following the history expansion character, even if it is unquoted: space, tab, newline, carriage return, and <strong>=</strong>. If the <strong>extglob</strong> shell option is enabled, <strong>(</strong> will also inhibit expansion.</p><p>Several shell options settable with the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin may be used to tailor the behavior of history expansion. If the <strong>histverify</strong> shell option is enabled (see the description of the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin below), and <strong>readline</strong> is being used, history substitutions are not immediately passed to the shell parser. Instead, the expanded line is reloaded into the <strong>readline</strong> editing buffer for further modification. If <strong>readline</strong> is being used, and the <strong>histreedit</strong> shell option is enabled, a failed history substitution will be reloaded into the <strong>readline</strong> editing buffer for correction. The <strong>-p</strong> option to the <strong>history</strong> builtin command may be used to see what a history expansion will do before using it. The <strong>-s</strong> option to the <strong>history</strong> builtin may be used to add commands to the end of the history list without actually executing them, so that they are available for subsequent recall.</p><p>The shell allows control of the various characters used by the history expansion mechanism (see the description of <strong>histchars</strong> above under <strong>Shell Variables</strong>). The shell uses the history comment character to mark history timestamps when writing the history file.</p><h3>Event Designators</h3>
<p>An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the history list. Unless the reference is absolute, events are relative to the current position in the history list.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>!</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Start a history substitution, except when followed by a <strong>blank</strong>, newline, carriage return, = or ( (when the <strong>extglob</strong> shell option is enabled using the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin).</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Refer to the most recent command preceding the current position in the history list containing <em>string</em>. The trailing <strong>?</strong> may be omitted if <em>string</em> is followed immediately by a newline.</p>

    <p><strong>\d\s+2^\s-2\u</strong><em>string1</em><strong>\d\s+2^\s-2\u</strong><em>string2</em><strong>\d\s+2^\s-2\u</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Quick substitution.  Repeat the previous command, replacing <em>string1</em> with <em>string2</em>. Equivalent to ``!!:s/<em>string1</em>/<em>string2</em>/'' (see <strong>Modifiers</strong> below).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>!#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The entire command line typed so far.</p>
  </dd>

<h3>Word Designators</h3>
<p>Word designators are used to select desired words from the event. A <strong>:</strong> separates the event specification from the word designator. It may be omitted if the word designator begins with a <strong>^</strong>, <strong>$</strong>, <strong>*</strong>, <strong>-</strong>, or <strong>%</strong>. Words are numbered from the beginning of the line, with the first word being denoted by 0 (zero). Words are inserted into the current line separated by single spaces.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>0 (zero)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command word.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>n</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <em>n</em>th word.</p>
  </dd>

    <p>The first argument.  That is, word 1.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>$</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The last word.  This is usually the last argument, but will expand to the zeroth word if there is only one word in the line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>%</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The word matched by the most recent `?<em>string</em>?' search.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>x</em><strong>-</strong><em>y</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A range of words; `-<em>y</em>' abbreviates `0-<em>y</em>'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>*</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>All of the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym for `<em>1-$</em>'.  It is not an error to use <strong>*</strong> if there is just one word in the event; the empty string is returned in that case.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>x*</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Abbreviates <em>x-$</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>x-</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Abbreviates <em>x-$</em> like <strong>x*</strong>, but omits the last word.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>If a word designator is supplied without an event specification, the previous command is used as the event.</p>
<h3>Modifiers</h3>
<p>After the optional word designator, there may appear a sequence of one or more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a `:'.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>h</strong></p>

    <p>Quote the substituted words as with <strong>q</strong>, but break into words at <strong>blanks</strong> and newlines.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>s/</strong><em>old</em><strong>/</strong><em>new</em><strong>/</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Substitute <em>new</em> for the first occurrence of <em>old</em> in the event line.  Any delimiter can be used in place of /.  The final delimiter is optional if it is the last character of the event line.  The delimiter may be quoted in <em>old</em> and <em>new</em> with a single backslash.  If & appears in <em>new</em>, it is replaced by <em>old</em>. A single backslash will quote the &.  If <em>old</em> is null, it is set to the last <em>old</em> substituted, or, if no previous history substitutions took place, the last <em>string</em> in a <strong>!?</strong><em>string</em><strong>[?]</strong> search.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>&</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Repeat the previous substitution.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>g</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line.  This is used in conjunction with `<strong>:s</strong>' (e.g., `<strong>:gs/</strong><em>old</em><strong>/</strong><em>new</em><strong>/</strong>') or `<strong>:&</strong>'.  If used with `<strong>:s</strong>', any delimiter can be used in place of /, and the final delimiter is optional if it is the last character of the event line. An <strong>a</strong> may be used as a synonym for <strong>g</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>G</strong></p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this section as accepting options preceded by <strong>-</strong> accepts <strong>--</strong> to signify the end of the options. The <strong>:</strong>, <strong>true</strong>, <strong>false</strong>, and <strong>test</strong> builtins do not accept options and do not treat <strong>--</strong> specially. The <strong>exit</strong>, <strong>logout</strong>, <strong>break</strong>, <strong>continue</strong>, <strong>let</strong>, and <strong>shift</strong> builtins accept and process arguments beginning with <strong>-</strong> without requiring <strong>--</strong>. Other builtins that accept arguments but are not specified as accepting options interpret arguments beginning with <strong>-</strong> as invalid options and require <strong>--</strong> to prevent this interpretation.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>

    <p>Read and execute commands from <em>filename</em> in the current shell environment and return the exit status of the last command executed from <em>filename</em>. If <em>filename</em> does not contain a slash, filenames in <small></small> <strong>PATH</strong> are used to find the directory containing <em>filename</em>. The file searched for in <small></small> <strong>PATH</strong> need not be executable. When <strong>bash</strong> is not in <em>posix mode</em>, the current directory is searched if no file is found in <small></small> <strong>PATH</strong>. If the <strong>sourcepath</strong> option to the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin command is turned off, the <small></small> <strong>PATH</strong> is not searched. If any <em>arguments</em> are supplied, they become the positional parameters when <em>filename</em> is executed.  Otherwise the positional parameters are unchanged.

    <p><strong>Alias</strong> with no arguments or with the <strong>-p</strong> option prints the list of aliases in the form <strong>alias</strong> <em>name</em>=<em>value</em> on standard output. When arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for each <em>name</em> whose <em>value</em> is given. A trailing space in  <em>value</em> causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution when the alias is expanded. For each <em>name</em> in the argument list for which no <em>value</em> is supplied, the name and value of the alias is printed. <strong>Alias</strong> returns true unless a <em>name</em> is given for which no alias has been defined.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bg</strong> [<em>jobspec</em> ...]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Resume each suspended job <em>jobspec</em> in the background, as if it had been started with <strong>&</strong>. If <em>jobspec</em> is not present, the shell's notion of the <em>current job</em> is used. <strong>bg</strong> <em>jobspec</em> returns 0 unless run when job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled, any specified <em>jobspec</em> was not found or was started without job control.</p>

The <strong>-P</strong> option causes <strong>cd</strong> to use the physical directory structure by resolving symbolic links while traversing <em>dir</em> and before processing instances of <em>..</em> in <em>dir</em> (see also the <strong>-P</strong> option to the <strong>set</strong> builtin command); the <strong>-L</strong> option forces symbolic links to be followed by resolving the link after processing instances of <em>..</em> in <em>dir</em>. If <em>..</em> appears in <em>dir</em>, it is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component from <em>dir</em>, back to a slash or the beginning of <em>dir</em>. If the <strong>-e</strong> option is supplied with <strong>-P</strong>, and the current working directory cannot be successfully determined after a successful directory change, <strong>cd</strong> will return an unsuccessful status. On systems that support it, the <strong>-@</strong> option presents the extended attributes associated with a file as a directory. An argument of <strong>-</strong> is converted to <small></small> <strong>$OLDPWD</strong> before the directory change is attempted. If a non-empty directory name from <small></small> <strong>CDPATH</strong> is used, or if <strong>-</strong> is the first argument, and the directory change is successful, the absolute pathname of the new working directory is written to the standard output. The return value is true if the directory was successfully changed; false otherwise.</p>

If either the <strong>-V</strong> or <strong>-v</strong> option is supplied, a description of <em>command</em> is printed.  The <strong>-v</strong> option causes a single word indicating the command or filename used to invoke <em>command</em> to be displayed; the <strong>-V</strong> option produces a more verbose description. If the <strong>-V</strong> or <strong>-v</strong> option is supplied, the exit status is 0 if <em>command</em> was found, and 1 if not.  If neither option is supplied and an error occurred or <em>command</em> cannot be found, the exit status is 127.

    <p>Enable and disable builtin shell commands. Disabling a builtin allows a disk command which has the same name as a shell builtin to be executed without specifying a full pathname, even though the shell normally searches for builtins before disk commands. If <strong>-n</strong> is used, each <em>name</em> is disabled; otherwise, <em>names</em> are enabled.  For example, to use the <strong>test</strong> binary found via the <small></small> <strong>PATH</strong> instead of the shell builtin version, run The <strong>-f</strong> option means to load the new builtin command <em>name</em> from shared object <em>filename</em>, on systems that support dynamic loading.  The <strong>-d</strong> option will delete a builtin previously loaded with <strong>-f</strong>. If no <em>name</em> arguments are given, or if the <strong>-p</strong> option is supplied, a list of shell builtins is printed. With no other option arguments, the list consists of all enabled shell builtins. If <strong>-n</strong> is supplied, only disabled builtins are printed. If <strong>-a</strong> is supplied, the list printed includes all builtins, with an indication of whether or not each is enabled. If <strong>-s</strong> is supplied, the output is restricted to the POSIX <em>special</em> builtins. The return value is 0 unless a <em>name</em> is not a shell builtin or there is an error loading a new builtin from a shared object.</p>

    <p>The <em>arg</em>s are read and concatenated together into a single command.  This command is then read and executed by the shell, and its exit status is returned as the value of <strong>eval</strong>. If there are no <em>args</em>, or only null arguments, <strong>eval</strong> returns 0.</p>

    <p>If <em>command</em> is specified, it replaces the shell. No new process is created.  The <em>arguments</em> become the arguments to <em>command</em>. If the <strong>-l</strong> option is supplied, the shell places a dash at the beginning of the zeroth argument passed to <em>command</em>. This is what <a href="../man1/login.1.html"><strong>login</strong>(1)</a> does.  The <strong>-c</strong> option causes <em>command</em> to be executed with an empty environment.  If <strong>-a</strong> is supplied, the shell passes <em>name</em> as the zeroth argument to the executed command. If <em>command</em> cannot be executed for some reason, a non-interactive shell exits, unless the <strong>execfail</strong> shell option is enabled.  In that case, it returns failure. An interactive shell returns failure if the file cannot be executed. If <em>command</em> is not specified, any redirections take effect in the current shell, and the return status is 0.  If there is a redirection error, the return status is 1.</p>

If the <strong>-f</strong> option is given, the <em>names</em> refer to functions. If no <em>names</em> are given, or if the <strong>-p</strong> option is supplied, a list of names of all exported variables is printed. The <strong>-n</strong> option causes the export property to be removed from each <em>name</em>. If a variable name is followed by =<em>word</em>, the value of the variable is set to <em>word</em>. <strong>export</strong> returns an exit status of 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the <em>names</em> is not a valid shell variable name, or <strong>-f</strong> is supplied with a <em>name</em> that is not a function.</p>

    <p>The first form selects a range of commands from <em>first</em> to <em>last</em> from the history list and displays or edits and re-executes them. <em>First</em> and <em>last</em> may be specified as a string (to locate the last command beginning with that string) or as a number (an index into the history list, where a negative number is used as an offset from the current command number).  If <em>last</em> is not specified it is set to the current command for listing (so that prints the last 10 commands) and to <em>first</em> otherwise. If <em>first</em> is not specified it is set to the previous command for editing and -16 for listing.</p><p>The <strong>-n</strong> option suppresses the command numbers when listing.  The <strong>-r</strong> option reverses the order of the commands.  If the <strong>-l</strong> option is given, the commands are listed on standard output.  Otherwise, the editor given by <em>ename</em> is invoked on a file containing those commands.  If <em>ename</em> is not given, the value of the <small></small> <strong>FCEDIT</strong> variable is used, and the value of <small></small> <strong>EDITOR</strong> if <small></small> <strong>FCEDIT</strong> is not set.  If neither variable is set, is used.  When editing is complete, the edited commands are echoed and executed.</p><p>In the second form, <em>command</em> is re-executed after each instance of <em>pat</em> is replaced by <em>rep</em>. <em>Command</em> is intepreted the same as <em>first</em> above. A useful alias to use with this is so that typing runs the last command beginning with and typing re-executes the last command.</p><p>If the first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered or <em>first</em> or <em>last</em> specify history lines out of range. If the <strong>-e</strong> option is supplied, the return value is the value of the last command executed or failure if an error occurs with the temporary file of commands.  If the second form is used, the return status is that of the command re-executed, unless <em>cmd</em> does not specify a valid history line, in which case <strong>fc</strong> returns failure.</p>

    <p>Resume <em>jobspec</em> in the foreground, and make it the current job. If <em>jobspec</em> is not present, the shell's notion of the <em>current job</em> is used. The return value is that of the command placed into the foreground, or failure if run when job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled, if <em>jobspec</em> does not specify a valid job or <em>jobspec</em> specifies a job that was started without job control.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>getopts</strong> <em>optstring</em> <em>name</em> [<em>args</em>]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>getopts</strong> is used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters. <em>optstring</em> contains the option characters to be recognized; if a character is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an argument, which should be separated from it by white space. The colon and question mark characters may not be used as option characters. Each time it is invoked, <strong>getopts</strong> places the next option in the shell variable <em>name</em>, initializing <em>name</em> if it does not exist, and the index of the next argument to be processed into the variable <small></small> <strong>OPTIND</strong>. <small></small> <strong>OPTIND</strong> is initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell script is invoked.  When an option requires an argument, <strong>getopts</strong> places that argument into the variable <small></small> <strong>OPTARG</strong>. The shell does not reset <small></small> <strong>OPTIND</strong> automatically; it must be manually reset between multiple calls to <strong>getopts</strong> within the same shell invocation if a new set of parameters is to be used.</p><p>When the end of options is encountered, <strong>getopts</strong> exits with a return value greater than zero. <small></small> <strong>OPTIND</strong> is set to the index of the first non-option argument, and <em>name</em> is set to ?.</p><p><strong>getopts</strong> normally parses the positional parameters, but if more arguments are given in <em>args</em>, <strong>getopts</strong> parses those instead.</p><p><strong>getopts</strong> can report errors in two ways.  If the first character of <em>optstring</em> is a colon, <em>silent</em> error reporting is used.  In normal operation, diagnostic messages are printed when invalid options or missing option arguments are encountered. If the variable <small></small> <strong>OPTERR</strong> is set to 0, no error messages will be displayed, even if the first character of <em>optstring</em> is not a colon.</p><p>If an invalid option is seen, <strong>getopts</strong> places ? into <em>name</em> and, if not silent, prints an error message and unsets <small></small> <strong>OPTARG</strong>. If <strong>getopts</strong> is silent, the option character found is placed in <small></small> <strong>OPTARG</strong> and no diagnostic message is printed.</p><p>If a required argument is not found, and <strong>getopts</strong> is not silent, a question mark (\^<strong>?</strong>\^) is placed in <em>name</em>, <small></small> <strong>OPTARG</strong> is unset, and a diagnostic message is printed. If <strong>getopts</strong> is silent, then a colon (\^<strong>:</strong>\^) is placed in <em>name</em> and <small></small> <strong>OPTARG</strong> is set to the option character found.</p><p><strong>getopts</strong> returns true if an option, specified or unspecified, is found. It returns false if the end of options is encountered or an error occurs.</p>

    <p><strong>hash</strong> [<strong>-lr</strong>] [<strong>-p</strong> <em>filename</em>] [<strong>-dt</strong>] [<em>name</em>]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Each time <strong>hash</strong> is invoked, the full pathname of the command <em>name</em> is determined by searching the directories in <strong>$PATH</strong> and remembered.  Any previously-remembered pathname is discarded. If the <strong>-p</strong> option is supplied, no path search is performed, and <em>filename</em> is used as the full filename of the command. The <strong>-r</strong> option causes the shell to forget all remembered locations. The <strong>-d</strong> option causes the shell to forget the remembered location of each <em>name</em>. If the <strong>-t</strong> option is supplied, the full pathname to which each <em>name</em> corresponds is printed.  If multiple <em>name</em> arguments are supplied with <strong>-t</strong>, the <em>name</em> is printed before the hashed full pathname. The <strong>-l</strong> option causes output to be displayed in a format that may be reused as input. If no arguments are given, or if only <strong>-l</strong> is supplied, information about remembered commands is printed. The return status is true unless a <em>name</em> is not found or an invalid option is supplied.</p>

The corresponding <em>argument</em> is an integer representing the number of seconds since the epoch. Two special argument values may be used: -1 represents the current time, and -2 represents the time the shell was invoked. If no argument is specified, conversion behaves as if -1 had been given. This is an exception to the usual <strong>printf</strong> behavior.</p>

    <p>One line is read from the standard input, or from the file descriptor <em>fd</em> supplied as an argument to the <strong>-u</strong> option, and the first word is assigned to the first <em>name</em>, the second word to the second <em>name</em>, and so on, with leftover words and their intervening separators assigned to the last <em>name</em>. If there are fewer words read from the input stream than names, the remaining names are assigned empty values. The characters in <small></small> <strong>IFS</strong> are used to split the line into words using the same rules the shell uses for expansion (described above under <strong>Word Splitting</strong>). The backslash character (<strong>&#92;</strong>) may be used to remove any special meaning for the next character read and for line continuation.

    <p>Cause <strong>read</strong> to time out and return failure if a complete line of input (or a specified number of characters) is not read within <em>timeout</em> seconds. <em>timeout</em> may be a decimal number with a fractional portion following the decimal point. This option is only effective if <strong>read</strong> is reading input from a terminal, pipe, or other special file; it has no effect when reading from regular files. If <strong>read</strong> times out, <strong>read</strong> saves any partial input read into the specified variable <em>name</em>. If <em>timeout</em> is 0, <strong>read</strong> returns immediately, without trying to read any data.  The exit status is 0 if input is available on the specified file descriptor, non-zero otherwise. The exit status is greater than 128 if the timeout is exceeded.</p>

    <p>The given <em>names</em> are marked readonly; the values of these <em>names</em> may not be changed by subsequent assignment. If the <strong>-f</strong> option is supplied, the functions corresponding to the <em>names</em> are so marked. The <strong>-a</strong> option restricts the variables to indexed arrays; the <strong>-A</strong> option restricts the variables to associative arrays. If both options are supplied, <strong>-A</strong> takes precedence. If no <em>name</em> arguments are given, or if the <strong>-p</strong> option is supplied, a list of all readonly names is printed. The other options may be used to restrict the output to a subset of the set of readonly names. The <strong>-p</strong> option causes output to be displayed in a format that may be reused as input. If a variable name is followed by =<em>word</em>, the value of the variable is set to <em>word</em>. The return status is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the <em>names</em> is not a valid shell variable name, or <strong>-f</strong> is supplied with a <em>name</em> that is not a function.</p>

    <p>Causes a function to stop executing and return the value specified by <em>n</em> to its caller. If <em>n</em> is omitted, the return status is that of the last command executed in the function body.  If <strong>return</strong> is used outside a function, but during execution of a script by the <strong>.</strong> (<strong>source</strong>) command, it causes the shell to stop executing that script and return either <em>n</em> or the exit status of the last command executed within the script as the exit status of the script. If <em>n</em> is supplied, the return value is its least significant 8 bits. The return status is non-zero if <strong>return</strong> is supplied a non-numeric argument, or is used outside a function and not during execution of a script by <strong>.</strong>\^ or <strong>source</strong>. Any command associated with the <strong>RETURN</strong> trap is executed before execution resumes after the function or script.</p>

    <p>Without options, the name and value of each shell variable are displayed in a format that can be reused as input for setting or resetting the currently-set variables. Read-only variables cannot be reset. In <em>posix</em> mode, only shell variables are listed. The output is sorted according to the current locale. When options are specified, they set or unset shell attributes. Any arguments remaining after option processing are treated as values for the positional parameters and are assigned, in order, to <strong>$1</strong>, <strong>$2</strong>, <strong>...</strong> <strong>$</strong><em>n</em><strong></strong>. Options, if specified, have the following meanings:</p>

    <p>Exit immediately if a <em>pipeline</em> (which may consist of a single <em>simple command</em>), a <em>list</em>, or a <em>compound command</em> (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL GRAMMAR</strong> above),  exits with a non-zero status. The shell does not exit if the command that fails is part of the command list immediately following a <strong>while</strong> or <strong>until</strong> keyword, part of the test following the <strong>if</strong> or <strong>elif</strong> reserved words, part of any command executed in a <strong>&&</strong> or <strong>||</strong> list except the command following the final <strong>&&</strong> or <strong>||</strong>, any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command's return value is being inverted with <strong>!</strong>. If a compound command other than a subshell returns a non-zero status because a command failed while <strong>-e</strong> was being ignored, the shell does not exit. A trap on <strong>ERR</strong>, if set, is executed before the shell exits. This option applies to the shell environment and each subshell environment separately (see <small></small> <strong>COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT</strong> above), and may cause subshells to exit before executing all the commands in the subshell. If a compound command or shell function executes in a context where <strong>-e</strong> is being ignored, none of the commands executed within the compound command or function body will be affected by the <strong>-e</strong> setting, even if <strong>-e</strong> is set and a command returns a failure status. If a compound command or shell function sets <strong>-e</strong> while executing in a context where <strong>-e</strong> is ignored, that setting will not have any effect until the compound command or the command containing the function call completes.</p>

    <p>The command <em>arg</em> is to be read and executed when the shell receives signal(s) <em>sigspec</em>. If <em>arg</em> is absent (and there is a single <em>sigspec</em>) or <strong>-</strong>, each specified signal is reset to its original disposition (the value it had upon entrance to the shell). If <em>arg</em> is the null string the signal specified by each <em>sigspec</em> is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes. If <em>arg</em> is not present and <strong>-p</strong> has been supplied, then the trap commands associated with each <em>sigspec</em> are displayed. If no arguments are supplied or if only <strong>-p</strong> is given, <strong>trap</strong> prints the list of commands associated with each signal. The <strong>-l</strong> option causes the shell to print a list of signal names and their corresponding numbers. Each <em>sigspec</em> is either a signal name defined in &lt;<em>signal.h</em>&gt;, or a signal number. Signal names are case insensitive and the <small></small> <strong>SIG</strong> prefix is optional. If a <em>sigspec</em> is <small></small> <strong>EXIT</strong> (0) the command <em>arg</em> is executed on exit from the shell. If a <em>sigspec</em> is <small></small> <strong>DEBUG</strong>, the command <em>arg</em> is executed before every <em>simple command</em>, <em>for</em> command, <em>case</em> command, <em>select</em> command, every arithmetic <em>for</em> command, and before the first command executes in a shell function (see <small></small> <strong>SHELL GRAMMAR</strong> above). Refer to the description of the <strong>extdebug</strong> option to the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin for details of its effect on the <strong>DEBUG</strong> trap. If a <em>sigspec</em> is <small></small> <strong>RETURN</strong>, the command <em>arg</em> is executed each time a shell function or a script executed with the <strong>.</strong> or <strong>source</strong> builtins finishes executing. If a <em>sigspec</em> is <small></small> <strong>ERR</strong>, the command <em>arg</em> is executed whenever a a pipeline (which may consist of a single simple command), a list, or a compound command returns a non-zero exit status, subject to the following conditions. The <small></small> <strong>ERR</strong> trap is not executed if the failed command is part of the command list immediately following a <strong>while</strong> or <strong>until</strong> keyword, part of the test in an <em>if</em> statement, part of a command executed in a <strong>&&</strong> or <strong>||</strong> list except the command following the final <strong>&&</strong> or <strong>||</strong>, any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command's return value is being inverted using <strong>!</strong>. These are the same conditions obeyed by the <strong>errexit</strong> (<strong>-e</strong>) option. Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or reset. Trapped signals that are not being ignored are reset to their original values in a subshell or subshell environment when one is created. The return status is false if any <em>sigspec</em> is invalid; otherwise <strong>trap</strong> returns true.</p>

If the <em>name</em> is not found, then nothing is printed, and an exit status of false is returned. If the <strong>-p</strong> option is used, <strong>type</strong> either returns the name of the disk file that would be executed if <em>name</em> were specified as a command name, or nothing if would not return <em>file</em>. The <strong>-P</strong> option forces a <small></small> <strong>PATH</strong> search for each <em>name</em>, even if would not return <em>file</em>. If a command is hashed, <strong>-p</strong> and <strong>-P</strong> print the hashed value, which is not necessarily the file that appears first in <small></small> <strong>PATH</strong>. If the <strong>-a</strong> option is used, <strong>type</strong> prints all of the places that contain an executable named <em>name</em>. This includes aliases and functions, if and only if the <strong>-p</strong> option is not also used. The table of hashed commands is not consulted when using <strong>-a</strong>. The <strong>-f</strong> option suppresses shell function lookup, as with the <strong>command</strong> builtin. <strong>type</strong> returns true if all of the arguments are found, false if any are not found.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Provides control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it, on systems that allow such control. The <strong>-H</strong> and <strong>-S</strong> options specify that the hard or soft limit is set for the given resource. A hard limit cannot be increased by a non-root user once it is set; a soft limit may be increased up to the value of the hard limit. If neither <strong>-H</strong> nor <strong>-S</strong> is specified, both the soft and hard limits are set. The value of <em>limit</em> can be a number in the unit specified for the resource or one of the special values <strong>hard</strong>, <strong>soft</strong>, or <strong>unlimited</strong>, which stand for the current hard limit, the current soft limit, and no limit, respectively. If <em>limit</em> is omitted, the current value of the soft limit of the resource is printed, unless the <strong>-H</strong> option is given.  When more than one resource is specified, the limit name and unit are printed before the value. Other options are interpreted as follows:</p>

<p>If <em>limit</em> is given, and the <strong>-a</strong> option is not used, <em>limit</em> is the new value of the specified resource. If no option is given, then <strong>-f</strong> is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte increments, except for <strong>-t</strong>, which is in seconds; <strong>-p</strong>, which is in units of 512-byte blocks; and <strong>-T</strong>, <strong>-b</strong>, <strong>-n</strong>, and <strong>-u</strong>, which are unscaled values. The return status is 0 unless an invalid option or argument is supplied, or an error occurs while setting a new limit.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>umask</strong> [<strong>-p</strong>] [<strong>-S</strong>] [<em>mode</em>]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The user file-creation mask is set to <em>mode</em>. If <em>mode</em> begins with a digit, it is interpreted as an octal number; otherwise it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar to that accepted by <strong>chmod</strong>(1). If <em>mode</em> is omitted, the current value of the mask is printed. The <strong>-S</strong> option causes the mask to be printed in symbolic form; the default output is an octal number. If the <strong>-p</strong> option is supplied, and <em>mode</em> is omitted, the output is in a form that may be reused as input. The return status is 0 if the mode was successfully changed or if no <em>mode</em> argument was supplied, and false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>unalias</strong> [-<strong>a</strong>] [<em>name</em> ...]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Remove each <em>name</em> from the list of defined aliases.  If <strong>-a</strong> is supplied, all alias definitions are removed.  The return value is true unless a supplied <em>name</em> is not a defined alias.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>unset</strong> [-<strong>fv</strong>] [-<strong>n</strong>] [<em>name</em> ...]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>For each <em>name</em>, remove the corresponding variable or function. If the <strong>-v</strong> option is given, each <em>name</em> refers to a shell variable, and that variable is removed. Read-only variables may not be unset. If <strong>-f</strong> is specified, each <em>name</em> refers to a shell function, and the function definition is removed. If the <strong>-n</strong> option is supplied, and <em>name</em> is a variable with the <em>nameref</em> attribute, <em>name</em> will be unset rather than the variable it references. <strong>-n</strong> has no effect if the <strong>-f</strong> option is supplied. If no options are supplied, each <em>name</em> refers to a variable; if there is no variable by that name, any function with that name is unset. Each unset variable or function is removed from the environment passed to subsequent commands. If any of <small></small> <strong>COMP_WORDBREAKS</strong>, <small></small> <strong>RANDOM</strong>, <small></small> <strong>SECONDS</strong>, <small></small> <strong>LINENO</strong>, <small></small> <strong>HISTCMD</strong>, <small></small> <strong>FUNCNAME</strong>, <small></small> <strong>GROUPS</strong>, or <small></small> <strong>DIRSTACK</strong> are unset, they lose their special properties, even if they are subsequently reset.  The exit status is true unless a <em>name</em> is readonly.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>wait</strong> [<strong>-n</strong>] [<em>n ...</em>]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Wait for each specified child process and return its termination status. Each <em>n</em> may be a process ID or a job specification; if a job spec is given, all processes in that job's pipeline are waited for.  If <em>n</em> is not given, all currently active child processes are waited for, and the return status is zero. If the <strong>-n</strong> option is supplied, <strong>wait</strong> waits for any job to terminate and returns its exit status. If <em>n</em> specifies a non-existent process or job, the return status is 127.  Otherwise, the return status is the exit status of the last process or job waited for.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>If <strong>bash</strong> is started with the name <strong>rbash</strong>, or the <strong>-r</strong> option is supplied at invocation, the shell becomes restricted.

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>It's too big and too slow.</p><p>There are some subtle differences between <strong>bash</strong> and traditional versions of <strong>sh</strong>, mostly because of the <small></small> <strong>POSIX</strong> specification.</p><p>Aliases are confusing in some uses.</p><p>Shell builtin commands and functions are not stoppable/restartable.</p><p>Compound commands and command sequences of the form `a ; b ; c' are not handled gracefully when process suspension is attempted. When a process is stopped, the shell immediately executes the next command in the sequence. It suffices to place the sequence of commands between parentheses to force it into a subshell, which may be stopped as a unit.</p><p>Array variables may not (yet) be exported.</p><p>There may be only one active coprocess at a time.</p>
