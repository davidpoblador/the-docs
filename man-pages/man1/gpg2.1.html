      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>gpg2</strong> is the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It is a tool to provide digital encryption and signing services using the OpenPGP standard. <strong>gpg2</strong> features complete key management and all bells and whistles you can expect from a decent OpenPGP implementation.</p><p>In contrast to the standalone version <strong>gpg</strong>, which is more suited for server and embedded platforms, this version is commonly installed under the name <strong>gpg2</strong> and more targeted to the desktop as it requires several other modules to be installed.  The standalone version will be kept maintained and it is possible to install both versions on the same system.  If you need to use different configuration files, you should make use of something like \(oq<em>gpg.conf-2</em>\(cq instead of just \(oq<em>gpg.conf</em>\(cq.</p>
        </div>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">RETURN VALUE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The program returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 if at least a signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">WARNINGS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Use a *good* password for your user account and a *good* passphrase to protect your secret key. This passphrase is the weakest part of the whole system. Programs to do dictionary attacks on your secret keyring are very easy to write and so you should protect your "~/.gnupg/" directory very well.</p><p>Keep in mind that, if this program is used over a network (telnet), it is *very* easy to spy out your passphrase!</p><p>If you are going to verify detached signatures, make sure that the program knows about it; either give both filenames on the command line or use &apos;-&apos; to specify STDIN.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">INTEROPERABILITY</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>GnuPG tries to be a very flexible implementation of the OpenPGP standard. In particular, GnuPG implements many of the optional parts of the standard, such as the SHA-512 hash, and the ZLIB and BZIP2 compression algorithms. It is important to be aware that not all OpenPGP programs implement these optional algorithms and that by forcing their use via the <strong>--cipher-algo</strong>, <strong>--digest-algo</strong>, <strong>--cert-digest-algo</strong>, or <strong>--compress-algo</strong> options in GnuPG, it is possible to create a perfectly valid OpenPGP message, but one that cannot be read by the intended recipient.</p><p>There are dozens of variations of OpenPGP programs available, and each supports a slightly different subset of these optional algorithms. For example, until recently, no (unhacked) version of PGP supported the BLOWFISH cipher algorithm. A message using BLOWFISH simply could not be read by a PGP user. By default, GnuPG uses the standard OpenPGP preferences system that will always do the right thing and create messages that are usable by all recipients, regardless of which OpenPGP program they use. Only override this safe default if you really know what you are doing.</p><p>If you absolutely must override the safe default, or if the preferences on a given key are invalid for some reason, you are far better off using the <strong>--pgp6</strong>, <strong>--pgp7</strong>, or <strong>--pgp8</strong> options. These options are safe as they do not force any particular algorithms in violation of OpenPGP, but rather reduce the available algorithms to a "PGP-safe" list.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">COMMANDS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that only one command is allowed.</p><p><strong>gpg2</strong> may be run with no commands, in which case it will perform a reasonable action depending on the type of file it is given as input (an encrypted message is decrypted, a signature is verified, a file containing keys is listed).</p><p>Please remember that option as well as command parsing stops as soon as a non-option is encountered, you can explicitly stop parsing by using the special option <strong>--</strong>.</p><h3>Commands not specific to the function</h3>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>

<h3>Commands to select the type of operation</h3>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--sign</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-s</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Make a signature. This command may be combined with <strong>--encrypt</strong> (for a signed and encrypted message), <strong>--symmetric</strong> (for a signed and symmetrically encrypted message), or <strong>--encrypt</strong> and <strong>--symmetric</strong> together (for a signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase).  The key to be used for signing is chosen by default or can be set with the <strong>--local-user</strong> and <strong>--default-key</strong> options.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--clearsign</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Make a clear text signature.  The content in a clear text signature is readable without any special software. OpenPGP software is only needed to verify the signature.  Clear text signatures may modify end-of-line whitespace for platform independence and are not intended to be reversible.  The key to be used for signing is chosen by default or can be set with the <strong>--local-user</strong> and <strong>--default-key</strong> options.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--detach-sign</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-b</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Make a detached signature.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--encrypt</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-e</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Encrypt data. This option may be combined with <strong>--sign</strong> (for a signed and encrypted message), <strong>--symmetric</strong> (for a message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase), or <strong>--sign</strong> and <strong>--symmetric</strong> together (for a signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--symmetric</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-c</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase. The default symmetric cipher used is CAST5, but may be chosen with the <strong>--cipher-algo</strong> option. This option may be combined with <strong>--sign</strong> (for a signed and symmetrically encrypted message), <strong>--encrypt</strong> (for a message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase), or <strong>--sign</strong> and <strong>--encrypt</strong> together (for a signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--store</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Store only (make a simple RFC1991 literal data packet).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--decrypt</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-d</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Decrypt the file given on the command line (or STDIN if no file is specified) and write it to STDOUT (or the file specified with <strong>--output</strong>). If the decrypted file is signed, the signature is also verified. This command differs from the default operation, as it never writes to the filename which is included in the file and it rejects files which don't begin with an encrypted message.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--verify</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Assume that the first argument is a signed file or a detached signature and verify it without generating any output. With no arguments, the signature packet is read from STDIN. If only a sigfile is given, it may be a complete signature or a detached signature, in which case the signed stuff is expected in a file without the ".sig" or ".asc" extension.  With more than 1 argument, the first should be a detached signature and the remaining files are the signed stuff. To read the signed stuff from STDIN, use &apos;-&apos; as the second filename.  For security reasons a detached signature cannot read the signed material from STDIN without denoting it in the above way.</p><p>Note: When verifying a cleartext signature, <strong>gpg</strong> verifies only what makes up the cleartext signed data and not any extra data outside of the cleartext signature or header lines following directly the dash marker line.  The option <strong>--output</strong> may be used to write out the actual signed data; but there are other pitfalls with this format as well.  It is suggested to avoid cleartext signatures in favor of detached signatures.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--multifile</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This modifies certain other commands to accept multiple files for processing on the command line or read from STDIN with each filename on a separate line. This allows for many files to be processed at once. <strong>--multifile</strong> may currently be used along with <strong>--verify</strong>, <strong>--encrypt</strong>, and <strong>--decrypt</strong>. Note that <strong>--multifile --verify</strong> may not be used with detached signatures.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--verify-files</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Identical to <strong>--multifile --verify</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--encrypt-files</strong></p>

  <dd>
    <p>Identical to <strong>--multifile --encrypt</strong>.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--list-public-keys</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>List all keys from the public keyrings, or just the keys given on the command line.</p><p>Avoid using the output of this command in scripts or other programs as it is likely to change as GnuPG changes. See <strong>--with-colons</strong> for a machine-parseable key listing command that is appropriate for use in scripts and other programs.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--list-secret-keys</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-K</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>List all keys from the secret keyrings, or just the ones given on the command line. A <strong>#</strong> after the letters <strong>sec</strong> means that the secret key is not usable (for example, if it was created via <strong>--export-secret-subkeys</strong>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--list-sigs</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Same as <strong>--list-keys</strong>, but the signatures are listed too. This command has the same effect as using <strong>--list-keys</strong> with <strong>--with-sig-list</strong>.</p><p>For each signature listed, there are several flags in between the "sig" tag and keyid. These flags give additional information about each signature. From left to right, they are the numbers 1-3 for certificate check level (see <strong>--ask-cert-level</strong>), "L" for a local or non-exportable signature (see <strong>--lsign-key</strong>), "R" for a nonRevocable signature (see the <strong>--edit-key</strong> command "nrsign"), "P" for a signature that contains a policy URL (see <strong>--cert-policy-url</strong>), "N" for a signature that contains a notation (see <strong>--cert-notation</strong>), "X" for an eXpired signature (see <strong>--ask-cert-expire</strong>), and the numbers 1-9 or "T" for 10 and above to indicate trust signature levels (see the <strong>--edit-key</strong> command "tsign").</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--check-sigs</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Same as <strong>--list-sigs</strong>, but the signatures are verified.  Note that for performance reasons the revocation status of a signing key is not shown. This command has the same effect as using <strong>--list-keys</strong> with <strong>--with-sig-check</strong>.</p><p>The status of the verification is indicated by a flag directly following the "sig" tag (and thus before the flags described above for <strong>--list-sigs</strong>).  A "!" indicates that the signature has been successfully verified, a "-" denotes a bad signature and a "%" is used if an error occurred while checking the signature (e.g. a non supported algorithm).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--locate-keys</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Locate the keys given as arguments.  This command basically uses the same algorithm as used when locating keys for encryption or signing and may thus be used to see what keys <strong>gpg2</strong> might use.  In particular external methods as defined by <strong>--auto-key-locate</strong> may be used to locate a key.  Only public keys are listed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--fingerprint</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>List all keys (or the specified ones) along with their fingerprints. This is the same output as <strong>--list-keys</strong> but with the additional output of a line with the fingerprint. May also be combined with <strong>--list-sigs</strong> or <strong>--check-sigs</strong>.  If this command is given twice, the fingerprints of all secondary keys are listed too.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--list-packets</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>List only the sequence of packets. This is mainly useful for debugging.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--card-edit</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Present a menu to work with a smartcard. The subcommand "help" provides an overview on available commands. For a detailed description, please see the Card HOWTO at https://gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-cardHOWTO .</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--card-status</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Show the content of the smart card.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--change-pin</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Present a menu to allow changing the PIN of a smartcard. This functionality is also available as the subcommand "passwd" with the <strong>--card-edit</strong> command.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--delete-key </strong><strong>name</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Remove key from the public keyring. In batch mode either <strong>--yes</strong> is required or the key must be specified by fingerprint. This is a safeguard against accidental deletion of multiple keys.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--delete-secret-key </strong><strong>name</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Remove key from the secret keyring. In batch mode the key must be specified by fingerprint.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--delete-secret-and-public-key </strong><strong>name</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Same as <strong>--delete-key</strong>, but if a secret key exists, it will be removed first. In batch mode the key must be specified by fingerprint.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--export</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Either export all keys from all keyrings (default keyrings and those registered via option <strong>--keyring</strong>), or if at least one name is given, those of the given name. The exported keys are written to STDOUT or to the file given with option <strong>--output</strong>.  Use together with <strong>--armor</strong> to mail those keys.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--send-keys </strong><strong>key IDs</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Similar to <strong>--export</strong> but sends the keys to a keyserver. Fingerprints may be used instead of key IDs. Option <strong>--keyserver</strong> must be used to give the name of this keyserver. Don't send your complete keyring to a keyserver --- select only those keys which are new or changed by you.  If no key IDs are given, <strong>gpg</strong> does nothing.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--export-secret-keys</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--export-secret-subkeys</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Same as <strong>--export</strong>, but exports the secret keys instead.  The exported keys are written to STDOUT or to the file given with option <strong>--output</strong>.  This command is often used along with the option <strong>--armor</strong> to allow easy printing of the key for paper backup; however the external tool <strong>paperkey</strong> does a better job for creating backups on paper.  Note that exporting a secret key can be a security risk if the exported keys are send over an insecure channel.</p><p>The second form of the command has the special property to render the secret part of the primary key useless; this is a GNU extension to OpenPGP and other implementations can not be expected to successfully import such a key.  Its intended use is to generated a full key with an additional signing subkey on a dedicated machine and then using this command to export the key without the primary key to the main machine.</p><p>See the option <strong>--simple-sk-checksum</strong> if you want to import an exported secret key into ancient OpenPGP implementations.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--import</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--fast-import</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Import/merge keys. This adds the given keys to the keyring. The fast version is currently just a synonym.</p><p>There are a few other options which control how this command works. Most notable here is the <strong>--import-options merge-only</strong> option which does not insert new keys but does only the merging of new signatures, user-IDs and subkeys.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--recv-keys </strong><strong>key IDs</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Import the keys with the given key IDs from a keyserver. Option <strong>--keyserver</strong> must be used to give the name of this keyserver.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--refresh-keys</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Request updates from a keyserver for keys that already exist on the local keyring. This is useful for updating a key with the latest signatures, user IDs, etc. Calling this with no arguments will refresh the entire keyring. Option <strong>--keyserver</strong> must be used to give the name of the keyserver for all keys that do not have preferred keyservers set (see <strong>--keyserver-options honor-keyserver-url</strong>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--search-keys </strong><strong>names</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Search the keyserver for the given names. Multiple names given here will be joined together to create the search string for the keyserver. Option <strong>--keyserver</strong> must be used to give the name of this keyserver.  Keyservers that support different search methods allow using the syntax specified in "How to specify a user ID" below. Note that different keyserver types support different search methods. Currently only LDAP supports them all.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--fetch-keys </strong><strong>URIs</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Retrieve keys located at the specified URIs. Note that different installations of GnuPG may support different protocols (HTTP, FTP, LDAP, etc.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--update-trustdb</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Do trust database maintenance. This command iterates over all keys and builds the Web of Trust. This is an interactive command because it may have to ask for the "ownertrust" values for keys. The user has to give an estimation of how far she trusts the owner of the displayed key to correctly certify (sign) other keys. GnuPG only asks for the ownertrust value if it has not yet been assigned to a key. Using the <strong>--edit-key</strong> menu, the assigned value can be changed at any time.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--check-trustdb</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Do trust database maintenance without user interaction. From time to time the trust database must be updated so that expired keys or signatures and the resulting changes in the Web of Trust can be tracked. Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is required and do it automatically unless <strong>--no-auto-check-trustdb</strong> is set. This command can be used to force a trust database check at any time. The processing is identical to that of <strong>--update-trustdb</strong> but it skips keys with a not yet defined "ownertrust".</p><p>For use with cron jobs, this command can be used together with <strong>--batch</strong> in which case the trust database check is done only if a check is needed. To force a run even in batch mode add the option <strong>--yes</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--export-ownertrust</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Send the ownertrust values to STDOUT. This is useful for backup purposes as these values are the only ones which can't be re-created from a corrupted trustdb.  Example:</p>
<pre>
  gpg2 --export-ownertrust &gt; otrust.txt
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--import-ownertrust</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Update the trustdb with the ownertrust values stored in <strong>files</strong> (or STDIN if not given); existing values will be overwritten.  In case of a severely damaged trustdb and if you have a recent backup of the ownertrust values (e.g. in the file \(oq<em>otrust.txt</em>\(cq, you may re-create the trustdb using these commands:</p>
<pre>
  cd ~/.gnupg
  rm trustdb.gpg
  gpg2 --import-ownertrust &lt; otrust.txt
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--rebuild-keydb-caches</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When updating from version 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 this command should be used to create signature caches in the keyring. It might be handy in other situations too.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--print-md </strong><strong>algo</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--print-mds</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Print message digest of algorithm ALGO for all given files or STDIN. With the second form (or a deprecated "*" as algo) digests for all available algorithms are printed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--gen-random </strong><strong>0|1|2</strong> <strong>count</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Emit <em>count</em> random bytes of the given quality level 0, 1 or 2. If <em>count</em> is not given or zero, an endless sequence of random bytes will be emitted.  If used with <strong>--armor</strong> the output will be base64 encoded.  PLEASE, don't use this command unless you know what you are doing; it may remove precious entropy from the system!</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--gen-prime </strong><strong>mode</strong> <strong>bits</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use the source, Luke :-). The output format is still subject to change.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--enarmor</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--dearmor</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Pack or unpack an arbitrary input into/from an OpenPGP ASCII armor. This is a GnuPG extension to OpenPGP and in general not very useful.</p>
  </dd>

<h3>How to manage your keys</h3>
<p>This section explains the main commands for key management</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--gen-key</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Generate a new key pair. This command is normally only used interactively.</p><p>There is an experimental feature which allows you to create keys in batch mode. See the file \(oq<em>doc/DETAILS</em>\(cq in the source distribution on how to use this.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--gen-revoke </strong><strong>name</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Generate a revocation certificate for the complete key. To revoke a subkey or a signature, use the <strong>--edit</strong> command.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--desig-revoke </strong><strong>name</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Generate a designated revocation certificate for a key. This allows a user (with the permission of the keyholder) to revoke someone else's key.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--edit-key</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Present a menu which enables you to do most of the key management related tasks.  It expects the specification of a key on the command line.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>uid </strong><strong>n</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Toggle selection of user ID or photographic user ID with index <strong>n</strong>. Use <strong>*</strong> to select all and <strong>0</strong> to deselect all.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>key </strong><strong>n</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Toggle selection of subkey with index <strong>n</strong>. Use <strong>*</strong> to select all and <strong>0</strong> to deselect all.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>sign</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Make a signature on key of user <strong>name</strong> If the key is not yet signed by the default user (or the users given with -u), the program displays the information of the key again, together with its fingerprint and asks whether it should be signed. This question is repeated for all users specified with -u.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>lsign</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Same as "sign" but the signature is marked as non-exportable and will therefore never be used by others. This may be used to make keys valid only in the local environment.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>nrsign</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Same as "sign" but the signature is marked as non-revocable and can therefore never be revoked.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>tsign</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Make a trust signature. This is a signature that combines the notions of certification (like a regular signature), and trust (like the "trust" command). It is generally only useful in distinct communities or groups.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Note that "l" (for local / non-exportable), "nr" (for non-revocable, and "t" (for trust) may be freely mixed and prefixed to "sign" to create a signature of any type desired.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>delsig</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Delete a signature. Note that it is not possible to retract a signature, once it has been send to the public (i.e. to a keyserver).  In that case you better use <strong>revsig</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>revsig</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Revoke a signature. For every signature which has been generated by one of the secret keys, GnuPG asks whether a revocation certificate should be generated.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>check</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Check the signatures on all selected user IDs.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>adduid</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Create an additional user ID.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>addphoto</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Create a photographic user ID. This will prompt for a JPEG file that will be embedded into the user ID. Note that a very large JPEG will make for a very large key. Also note that some programs will display your JPEG unchanged (GnuPG), and some programs will scale it to fit in a dialog box (PGP).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>showphoto</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Display the selected photographic user ID.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>deluid</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Delete a user ID or photographic user ID.  Note that it is not possible to retract a user id, once it has been send to the public (i.e. to a keyserver).  In that case you better use <strong>revuid</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>revuid</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Revoke a user ID or photographic user ID.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>primary</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Flag the current user id as the primary one, removes the primary user id flag from all other user ids and sets the timestamp of all affected self-signatures one second ahead. Note that setting a photo user ID as primary makes it primary over other photo user IDs, and setting a regular user ID as primary makes it primary over other regular user IDs.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>keyserver</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set a preferred keyserver for the specified user ID(s). This allows other users to know where you prefer they get your key from. See <strong>--keyserver-options honor-keyserver-url</strong> for more on how this works.  Setting a value of "none" removes an existing preferred keyserver.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>notation</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set a name=value notation for the specified user ID(s). See <strong>--cert-notation</strong> for more on how this works. Setting a value of "none" removes all notations, setting a notation prefixed with a minus sign (-) removes that notation, and setting a notation name (without the =value) prefixed with a minus sign removes all notations with that name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>pref</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>List preferences from the selected user ID. This shows the actual preferences, without including any implied preferences.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>showpref</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>More verbose preferences listing for the selected user ID. This shows the preferences in effect by including the implied preferences of 3DES (cipher), SHA-1 (digest), and Uncompressed (compression) if they are not already included in the preference list. In addition, the preferred keyserver and signature notations (if any) are shown.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>setpref </strong><strong>string</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the list of user ID preferences to <strong>string</strong> for all (or just the selected) user IDs. Calling setpref with no arguments sets the preference list to the default (either built-in or set via <strong>--default-preference-list</strong>), and calling setpref with "none" as the argument sets an empty preference list. Use <strong>gpg2</strong> --version to get a list of available algorithms. Note that while you can change the preferences on an attribute user ID (aka "photo ID"), GnuPG does not select keys via attribute user IDs so these preferences will not be used by GnuPG.</p><p>When setting preferences, you should list the algorithms in the order which you'd like to see them used by someone else when encrypting a message to your key.  If you don't include 3DES, it will be automatically added at the end.  Note that there are many factors that go into choosing an algorithm (for example, your key may not be the only recipient), and so the remote OpenPGP application being used to send to you may or may not follow your exact chosen order for a given message.  It will, however, only choose an algorithm that is present on the preference list of every recipient key.  See also the INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>addkey</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Add a subkey to this key.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>addcardkey</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Generate a subkey on a card and add it to this key.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>keytocard</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Transfer the selected secret subkey (or the primary key if no subkey has been selected) to a smartcard. The secret key in the keyring will be replaced by a stub if the key could be stored successfully on the card and you use the save command later. Only certain key types may be transferred to the card. A sub menu allows you to select on what card to store the key. Note that it is not possible to get that key back from the card - if the card gets broken your secret key will be lost unless you have a backup somewhere.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bkuptocard </strong><strong>file</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Restore the given file to a card. This command may be used to restore a backup key (as generated during card initialization) to a new card. In almost all cases this will be the encryption key. You should use this command only with the corresponding public key and make sure that the file given as argument is indeed the backup to restore. You should then select 2 to restore as encryption key.  You will first be asked to enter the passphrase of the backup key and then for the Admin PIN of the card.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>delkey</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Remove a subkey (secondart key). Note that it is not possible to retract a subkey, once it has been send to the public (i.e. to a keyserver).  In that case you better use <strong>revkey</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>revkey</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Revoke a subkey.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>expire</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change the key or subkey expiration time. If a subkey is selected, the expiration time of this subkey will be changed. With no selection, the key expiration of the primary key is changed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>trust</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change the owner trust value for the key. This updates the trust-db immediately and no save is required.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>disable</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>enable</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Disable or enable an entire key. A disabled key can not normally be used for encryption.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>addrevoker</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Add a designated revoker to the key. This takes one optional argument: "sensitive". If a designated revoker is marked as sensitive, it will not be exported by default (see export-options).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>passwd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change the passphrase of the secret key.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>toggle</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Toggle between public and secret key listing.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>clean</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Compact (by removing all signatures except the selfsig) any user ID that is no longer usable (e.g. revoked, or expired). Then, remove any signatures that are not usable by the trust calculations. Specifically, this removes any signature that does not validate, any signature that is superseded by a later signature, revoked signatures, and signatures issued by keys that are not present on the keyring.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>minimize</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Make the key as small as possible. This removes all signatures from each user ID except for the most recent self-signature.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>cross-certify</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Add cross-certification signatures to signing subkeys that may not currently have them. Cross-certification signatures protect against a subtle attack against signing subkeys. See <strong>--require-cross-certification</strong>.  All new keys generated have this signature by default, so this option is only useful to bring older keys up to date.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>save</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Save all changes to the key rings and quit.</p>
  </dd>

    <p><strong>quit</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Quit the program without updating the key rings.</p>

<p><strong>gpg2</strong> features a bunch of options to control the exact behaviour and to change the default configuration.</p><p>Long options can be put in an options file (default "~/.gnupg/gpg.conf"). Short option names will not work - for example, "armor" is a valid option for the options file, while "a" is not. Do not write the 2 dashes, but simply the name of the option and any required arguments. Lines with a hash ('#') as the first non-white-space character are ignored. Commands may be put in this file too, but that is not generally useful as the command will execute automatically with every execution of gpg.</p><p>Please remember that option parsing stops as soon as a non-option is encountered, you can explicitly stop parsing by using the special option <strong>--</strong>.</p><h3>How to change the configuration</h3>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--default-key </strong><em>name</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use <em>name</em> as the default key to sign with. If this option is not used, the default key is the first key found in the secret keyring. Note that <strong>-u</strong> or <strong>--local-user</strong> overrides this option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--default-recipient </strong><em>name</em></p>

    <p>Use <em>name</em> as default recipient if option <strong>--recipient</strong> is not used and don't ask if this is a valid one. <em>name</em> must be non-empty.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--default-recipient-self</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use the default key as default recipient if option <strong>--recipient</strong> is not used and don't ask if this is a valid one. The default key is the first one from the secret keyring or the one set with <strong>--default-key</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--no-batch</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use batch mode.  Never ask, do not allow interactive commands. <strong>--no-batch</strong> disables this option.  Note that even with a filename given on the command line, gpg might still need to read from STDIN (in particular if gpg figures that the input is a detached signature and no data file has been specified).  Thus if you do not want to feed data via STDIN, you should connect STDIN to \(oq<em>/dev/null</em>\(cq.</p>
  </dd>

    <p>Set the name of the home directory to <em>dir</em>. If this option is not used, the home directory defaults to \(oq<em>~/.gnupg</em>\(cq.  It is only recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any home directory stated through the environment variable \(oq<em>GNUPGHOME</em>\(cq or (on W32 systems) by means of the Registry entry <em>HKCU&#92;Software&#92;GNU&#92;GnuPG:HomeDir</em>.</p>

    <p>Set compression level to <strong>n</strong> for the ZIP and ZLIB compression algorithms. The default is to use the default compression level of zlib (normally 6). <strong>--bzip2-compress-level</strong> sets the compression level for the BZIP2 compression algorithm (defaulting to 6 as well). This is a different option from <strong>--compress-level</strong> since BZIP2 uses a significant amount of memory for each additional compression level. <strong>-z</strong> sets both. A value of 0 for <strong>n</strong> disables compression.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>The default to use for the check level when signing a key.</p><p>0 means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified the key.</p><p>1 means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own it but you could not, or did not verify the key at all. This is useful for a "persona" verification, where you sign the key of a pseudonymous user.</p><p>2 means you did casual verification of the key. For example, this could mean that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the user ID on the key against a photo ID.</p><p>3 means you did extensive verification of the key. For example, this could mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the key in person, and that you checked, by means of a hard to forge document with a photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner matches the name in the user ID on the key, and finally that you verified (by exchange of email) that the email address on the key belongs to the key owner.</p><p>Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are just that: examples. In the end, it is up to you to decide just what "casual" and "extensive" mean to you.</p><p>This option defaults to 0 (no particular claim).</p>

    <p>Skip key validation and assume that used keys are always fully trusted. You generally won't use this unless you are using some external validation scheme. This option also suppresses the "[uncertain]" tag printed with signature checks when there is no evidence that the user ID is bound to the key.  Note that this trust model still does not allow the use of expired, revoked, or disabled keys.</p>

    <p>GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed using this option. This happens when encrypting to an email address (in the "user@example.com" form), and there are no user@example.com keys on the local keyring.

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>local</strong></p>

  <dd>
    <p>Locate the key using the local keyrings.  This mechanism allows to select the order a local key lookup is done.  Thus using &apos;--auto-key-locate local&apos; is identical to <strong>--no-auto-key-locate</strong>.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--keyserver </strong><strong>name</strong></p>

    <p>Use <strong>name</strong> as your keyserver. This is the server that <strong>--recv-keys</strong>, <strong>--send-keys</strong>, and <strong>--search-keys</strong> will communicate with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on. The format of the <strong>name</strong> is a URI: `scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]' The scheme is the type of keyserver: "hkp" for the HTTP (or compatible) keyservers, "ldap" for the LDAP keyservers, or "mailto" for the Graff email keyserver. Note that your particular installation of GnuPG may have other keyserver types available as well. Keyserver schemes are case-insensitive. After the keyserver name, optional keyserver configuration options may be provided. These are the same as the global <strong>--keyserver-options</strong> from below, but apply only to this particular keyserver.</p><p>Most keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is generally no need to send keys to more than one server. The keyserver <strong>hkp://keys.gnupg.net</strong> uses round robin DNS to give a different keyserver each time you use it.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--keyserver-options </strong><strong>name=value1 </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for the keyserver. Options can be prefixed with a `no-' to give the opposite meaning. Valid import-options or export-options may be used here as well to apply to importing (<strong>--recv-key</strong>) or exporting (<strong>--send-key</strong>) a key from a keyserver. While not all options are available for all keyserver types, some common options are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>include-revoked</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When searching for a key with <strong>--search-keys</strong>, include keys that are marked on the keyserver as revoked. Note that not all keyservers differentiate between revoked and unrevoked keys, and for such keyservers this option is meaningless. Note also that most keyservers do not have cryptographic verification of key revocations, and so turning this option off may result in skipping keys that are incorrectly marked as revoked.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>include-disabled</strong></p>

  <dd>
    <p>When searching for a key with <strong>--search-keys</strong>, include keys that are marked on the keyserver as disabled. Note that this option is not used with HKP keyservers.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>auto-key-retrieve</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option enables the automatic retrieving of keys from a keyserver when verifying signatures made by keys that are not on the local keyring.</p><p>Note that this option makes a "web bug" like behavior possible. Keyserver operators can see which keys you request, so by sending you a message signed by a brand new key (which you naturally will not have on your local keyring), the operator can tell both your IP address and the time when you verified the signature.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>honor-keyserver-url</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When using <strong>--refresh-keys</strong>, if the key in question has a preferred keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver to refresh the key from. In addition, if auto-key-retrieve is set, and the signature being verified has a preferred keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver to fetch the key from. Defaults to yes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>honor-pka-record</strong></p>

    <p>If auto-key-retrieve is set, and the signature being verified has a PKA record, then use the PKA information to fetch the key. Defaults to yes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>include-subkeys</strong></p>

    <p>When receiving a key, include subkeys as potential targets. Note that this option is not used with HKP keyservers, as they do not support retrieving keys by subkey id.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>use-temp-files</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>On most Unix-like platforms, GnuPG communicates with the keyserver helper program via pipes, which is the most efficient method. This option forces GnuPG to use temporary files to communicate. On some platforms (such as Win32 and RISC OS), this option is always enabled.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>keep-temp-files</strong></p>

    <p>Tell the keyserver helper program how long (in seconds) to try and perform a keyserver action before giving up. Note that performing multiple actions at the same time uses this timeout value per action. For example, when retrieving multiple keys via <strong>--recv-keys</strong>, the timeout applies separately to each key retrieval, and not to the <strong>--recv-keys</strong> command as a whole. Defaults to 30 seconds.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Secret keys are integrity protected by using a SHA-1 checksum. This method is part of the upcoming enhanced OpenPGP specification but GnuPG already uses it as a countermeasure against certain attacks. Old applications don't understand this new format, so this option may be used to switch back to the old behaviour. Using this option bears a security risk. Note that using this option only takes effect when the secret key is encrypted - the simplest way to make this happen is to change the passphrase on the key (even changing it to the same value is acceptable).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--no-sig-cache</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Do not cache the verification status of key signatures. Caching gives a much better performance in key listings. However, if you suspect that your public keyring is not save against write modifications, you can use this option to disable the caching. It probably does not make sense to disable it because all kind of damage can be done if someone else has write access to your public keyring.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--no-sig-create-check</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>GnuPG normally verifies each signature right after creation to protect against bugs and hardware malfunctions which could leak out bits from the secret key. This extra verification needs some time (about 115% for DSA keys), and so this option can be used to disable it. However, due to the fact that the signature creation needs manual interaction, this performance penalty does not matter in most settings.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Disable locking entirely. This option should be used only in very special environments, where it can be assured that only one process is accessing those files. A bootable floppy with a stand-alone encryption system will probably use this. Improper usage of this option may lead to data and key corruption.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--exit-on-status-write-error</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option will cause write errors on the status FD to immediately terminate the process. That should in fact be the default but it never worked this way and thus we need an option to enable this, so that the change won't break applications which close their end of a status fd connected pipe too early. Using this option along with <strong>--enable-progress-filter</strong> may be used to cleanly cancel long running gpg operations.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--limit-card-insert-tries </strong><strong>n</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With <strong>n</strong> greater than 0 the number of prompts asking to insert a smartcard gets limited to N-1. Thus with a value of 1 gpg won't at all ask to insert a card if none has been inserted at startup. This option is useful in the configuration file in case an application does not know about the smartcard support and waits ad infinitum for an inserted card.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--no-random-seed-file</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>GnuPG uses a file to store its internal random pool over invocations. This makes random generation faster; however sometimes write operations are not desired. This option can be used to achieve that with the cost of slower random generation.</p>

    <p>Suppress the warning about unsafe file and home directory (<strong>--homedir</strong>) permissions. Note that the permission checks that GnuPG performs are not intended to be authoritative, but rather they simply warn about certain common permission problems. Do not assume that the lack of a warning means that your system is secure.</p><p>Note that the warning for unsafe <strong>--homedir</strong> permissions cannot be suppressed in the gpg.conf file, as this would allow an attacker to place an unsafe gpg.conf file in place, and use this file to suppress warnings about itself. The <strong>--homedir</strong> permissions warning may only be suppressed on the command line.</p>

    <p>When verifying a signature made from a subkey, ensure that the cross certification "back signature" on the subkey is present and valid.

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Encrypt for user ID <em>name</em>, but hide the key ID of this user's key. This option helps to hide the receiver of the message and is a limited countermeasure against traffic analysis. If this option or <strong>--recipient</strong> is not specified, GnuPG asks for the user ID unless <strong>--default-recipient</strong> is given.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>

    <p>Same as <strong>--recipient</strong> but this one is intended for use in the options file and may be used with your own user-id as an "encrypt-to-self". These keys are only used when there are other recipients given either by use of <strong>--recipient</strong> or by the asked user id.  No trust checking is performed for these user ids and even disabled keys can be used.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>--group </strong><strong>name=value1 </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Sets up a named group, which is similar to aliases in email programs. Any time the group name is a recipient (<strong>-r</strong> or <strong>--recipient</strong>), it will be expanded to the values specified. Multiple groups with the same name are automatically merged into a single group.</p><p>The values are <strong>key IDs</strong> or fingerprints, but any key description is accepted. Note that a value with spaces in it will be treated as two different values. Note also there is only one level of expansion --- you cannot make an group that points to another group. When used from the command line, it may be necessary to quote the argument to this option to prevent the shell from treating it as multiple arguments.</p>
  </dd>

    <p>Don't look at the key ID as stored in the message but try all secret keys in turn to find the right decryption key. This option forces the behaviour as used by anonymous recipients (created by using <strong>--throw-keyids</strong> or <strong>--hidden-recipient</strong>) and might come handy in case where an encrypted message contains a bogus key ID.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>During decryption skip all anonymous recipients.  This option helps in the case that people use the hidden recipients feature to hide there own encrypt-to key from others.  If oneself has many secret keys this may lead to a major annoyance because all keys are tried in turn to decrypt soemthing which was not really intended for it.  The drawback of this option is that it is currently not possible to decrypt a message which includes real anonymous recipients.</p>

    <p><strong>--max-output </strong><strong>n</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option sets a limit on the number of bytes that will be generated when processing a file. Since OpenPGP supports various levels of compression, it is possible that the plaintext of a given message may be significantly larger than the original OpenPGP message. While GnuPG works properly with such messages, there is often a desire to set a maximum file size that will be generated before processing is forced to stop by the OS limits. Defaults to 0, which means "no limit".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--import-options </strong><strong>parameters</strong></p>

    <p>This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for importing keys. Options can be prepended with a `no-' to give the opposite meaning. The options are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>import-local-sigs</strong></p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>import-keep-ownertrust</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally possible still existing ownertrust values of a key are cleared if a key is imported.  This is in general desirable so that a formerly deleted key does not automatically gain an ownertrust values merely due to import.  On the other hand it is sometimes necessary to re-import a trusted set of keys again but keeping already assigned ownertrust values.  This can be achived by using this option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>repair-pks-subkey-bug</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>During import, attempt to repair the damage caused by the PKS keyserver bug (pre version 0.9.6) that mangles keys with multiple subkeys. Note that this cannot completely repair the damaged key as some crucial data is removed by the keyserver, but it does at least give you back one subkey.

    <p><strong>export-reset-subkey-passwd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When using the <strong>--export-secret-subkeys</strong> command, this option resets the passphrases for all exported subkeys to empty. This is useful when the exported subkey is to be used on an unattended machine where a passphrase doesn't necessarily make sense. Defaults to no.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>export-clean</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Compact (remove all signatures from) user IDs on the key being exported if the user IDs are not usable. Also, do not export any signatures that are not usable. This includes signatures that were issued by keys that are not present on the keyring. This option is the same as running the <strong>--edit-key</strong> command "clean" before export except that the local copy of the key is not modified. Defaults to no.</p>

The most highly ranked digest algorithm in this list is also used when signing without encryption (e.g. <strong>--clearsign</strong> or <strong>--sign</strong>).</p>

    <p>Set the list of personal compression preferences to <strong>string</strong>. Use <strong>gpg2 --version</strong> to get a list of available algorithms, and use <strong>none</strong> to set no preference at all.  This allows the user to safely override the algorithm chosen by the recipient key preferences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that is usable by all recipients.  The most highly ranked compression algorithm in this list is also used when there are no recipient keys to consider (e.g. <strong>--symmetric</strong>).</p>

If <strong>n</strong> is 0 a plain passphrase (which is not recommended) will be used, a 1 adds a salt to the passphrase and a 3 (the default) iterates the whole process a number of times (see --s2k-count).  Unless <strong>--rfc1991</strong> is used, this mode is also used for conventional encryption.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--s2k-count </strong><strong>n</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify how many times the passphrase mangling is repeated.  This value may range between 1024 and 65011712 inclusive.  The default is inquired from gpg-agent.  Note that not all values in the 1024-65011712 range are legal and if an illegal value is selected, GnuPG will round up to the nearest legal value.  This option is only meaningful if <strong>--s2k-mode</strong> is 3.</p>

<h3>Compliance options</h3>
<p>These options control what GnuPG is compliant to. Only one of these options may be active at a time. Note that the default setting of this is nearly always the correct one. See the INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below before using one of these options.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--gnupg</strong></p>

  <dd>
    <p>Use standard GnuPG behavior. This is essentially OpenPGP behavior (see <strong>--openpgp</strong>), but with some additional workarounds for common compatibility problems in different versions of PGP. This is the default option, so it is not generally needed, but it may be useful to override a different compliance option in the gpg.conf file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--openpgp</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>

Use this option to reset all previous options like <strong>--s2k-*</strong>, <strong>--cipher-algo</strong>, <strong>--digest-algo</strong> and <strong>--compress-algo</strong> to OpenPGP compliant values. All PGP workarounds are disabled.</p>
  </dd>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set up all options to be as PGP 2.x compliant as possible, and warn if an action is taken (e.g. encrypting to a non-RSA key) that will create a message that PGP 2.x will not be able to handle. Note that `PGP 2.x' here means `MIT PGP 2.6.2'. There are other versions of PGP 2.x available, but the MIT release is a good common baseline.</p><p>This option implies <strong>--rfc1991 --disable-mdc --no-force-v4-certs</strong> --escape-from-lines --force-v3-sigs --allow-weak-digest-algos --cipher-algo IDEA --digest-algo MD5 --compress-algo ZIP. It also disables <strong>--textmode</strong> when encrypting.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--pgp6</strong></p>

    <p>Set up all options to be as PGP 6 compliant as possible. This restricts you to the ciphers IDEA (if the IDEA plugin is installed), 3DES, and CAST5, the hashes MD5, SHA1 and RIPEMD160, and the compression algorithms none and ZIP. This also disables --throw-keyids, and making signatures with signing subkeys as PGP 6 does not understand signatures made by signing subkeys.</p><p>This option implies <strong>--disable-mdc --escape-from-lines</strong> --force-v3-sigs.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--pgp7</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set up all options to be as PGP 7 compliant as possible. This is identical to <strong>--pgp6</strong> except that MDCs are not disabled, and the list of allowable ciphers is expanded to add AES128, AES192, AES256, and TWOFISH.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--pgp8</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set up all options to be as PGP 8 compliant as possible. PGP 8 is a lot closer to the OpenPGP standard than previous versions of PGP, so all this does is disable <strong>--throw-keyids</strong> and set <strong>--escape-from-lines</strong>.  All algorithms are allowed except for the SHA224, SHA384, and SHA512 digests.</p>

"bzip2" is a more modern compression scheme that can compress some things better than zip or zlib, but at the cost of more memory used during compression and decompression. "uncompressed" or "none" disables compression. If this option is not used, the default behavior is to examine the recipient key preferences to see which algorithms the recipient supports. If all else fails, ZIP is used for maximum compatibility.</p><p>ZLIB may give better compression results than ZIP, as the compression window size is not limited to 8k. BZIP2 may give even better compression results than that, but will use a significantly larger amount of memory while compressing and decompressing. This may be significant in low memory situations. Note, however, that PGP (all versions) only supports ZIP compression. Using any algorithm other than ZIP or "none" will make the message unreadable with PGP. In general, you do not want to use this option as it allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard. <strong>--personal-compress-preferences</strong> is the safe way to accomplish the same thing.</p>

    <p>Do not put the recipient key IDs into encrypted messages. This helps to hide the receivers of the message and is a limited countermeasure against traffic analysis. ([Using a little social engineering anyone who is able to decrypt the message can check whether one of the other recipients is the one he suspects.])  On the receiving side, it may slow down the decryption process because all available secret keys must be tried.  <strong>--no-throw-keyids</strong> disables this option.

    <p>This option changes the behavior of cleartext signatures so that they can be used for patch files. You should not send such an armored file via email because all spaces and line endings are hashed too. You can not use this option for data which has 5 dashes at the beginning of a line, patch files don't have this. A special armor header line tells GnuPG about this cleartext signature option.</p>

    <p>Because some mailers change lines starting with "From " to "&gt;From " it is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating cleartext signatures to prevent the mail system from breaking the signature.

    <p>GnuPG normally does not select and use subkeys created in the future. This option allows the use of such keys and thus exhibits the pre-1.0.7 behaviour. You should not use this option unless there is some clock problem. See also <strong>--ignore-time-conflict</strong> for timestamp issues with signatures.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--ignore-crc-error</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The ASCII armor used by OpenPGP is protected by a CRC checksum against transmission errors. Occasionally the CRC gets mangled somewhere on the transmission channel but the actual content (which is protected by the OpenPGP protocol anyway) is still okay. This option allows GnuPG to ignore CRC errors.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--ignore-mdc-error</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option changes a MDC integrity protection failure into a warning. This can be useful if a message is partially corrupt, but it is necessary to get as much data as possible out of the corrupt message. However, be aware that a MDC protection failure may also mean that the message was tampered with intentionally by an attacker.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--allow-weak-digest-algos</strong></p>

    <p>Signatures made with the broken MD5 algorithm are normally rejected with an ``invalid digest algorithm'' message.  This option allows the verification of signatures made with such weak algorithms.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--no-default-keyring</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Do not add the default keyrings to the list of keyrings. Note that GnuPG will not operate without any keyrings, so if you use this option and do not provide alternate keyrings via <strong>--keyring</strong> or <strong>--secret-keyring</strong>, then GnuPG will still use the default public or secret keyrings.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--skip-verify</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Skip the signature verification step. This may be used to make the decryption faster if the signature verification is not needed.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Changes the output of the list commands to work faster; this is achieved by leaving some parts empty. Some applications don't need the user ID and the trust information given in the listings.

<p>There are different ways to specify a user ID to GnuPG.  Some of them are only valid for <strong>gpg</strong> others are only good for <strong>gpgsm</strong>.  Here is the entire list of ways to specify a key:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>By key Id.</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This format is deduced from the length of the string and its content or <strong>0x</strong> prefix. The key Id of an X.509 certificate are the low 64 bits of its SHA-1 fingerprint.  The use of key Ids is just a shortcut, for all automated processing the fingerprint should be used.</p><p>When using <strong>gpg</strong> an exclamation mark (!) may be appended to force using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and calculate which primary or secondary key to use.</p><p>The last four lines of the example give the key ID in their long form as internally used by the OpenPGP protocol.

The program drops root privileges as soon as locked memory is allocated.</p><p>Note also that some systems (especially laptops) have the ability to ``suspend to disk'' (also known as ``safe sleep'' or ``hibernate''). This writes all memory to disk before going into a low power or even powered off mode.  Unless measures are taken in the operating system to protect the saved memory, passphrases or other sensitive material may be recoverable from it later.</p><p>Before you report a bug you should first search the mailing list archives for similar problems and second check whether such a bug has already been reported to our bug tracker at http://bugs.gnupg.org .</p>
