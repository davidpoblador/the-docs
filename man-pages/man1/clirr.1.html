        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Clirr is a tool that checks Java libraries for binary and source compatibility with older releases. Basically you give it two sets of jar files and Clirr dumps out a list of changes in the public API.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">MESSAGES</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>When clirr generates an ERROR, WARNING or INFO message about a change in the jars being compared, there is an associated message reference code. This manual contains an explanation of the meaning of that message which may contain information which could not be fitted into the brief message summary.</p><p>Messages are separated into three severity levels: ERROR, WARNING and INFO.</p><p>Errors come in two flavours:</p><ul>
<li><p>Link-time failures, where an exception will be thrown as soon as code compiled against an old version of a class and the new version of the class are loaded into the same classloader hierarchy.</p></li><li><p>Run-time failures, where an exception is thrown when code compiled against the old version of a class attempts to call a method on a new version of the class, or vice versa.</p><p>Clirr reports "errors" for cases where it is possible to get a run-time failure. Whether one actually occurs can depend upon the way the library is called, i.e. changes reported as an error may in fact work when used as long as the patterns of use of the library do not trigger the failure situation.</p><p>Warnings are issued for situations where no link or runtime exception will occur, but where the application may behave unexpectedly due to the changes that have occurred.</p><p>Information messages provide users with information about new features which have been added without breaking backward compatibility in any way.</p><p>When using clirr to report on changes to items which have private or package scope, these changes are always reported as INFO level changes, never WARNING or ERROR level. This allows users of clirr to generate "change reports" at a level suitable for developers without having some of those changes marked (irrelevantly) as binary incompatibilities.</p><p>There can never be binary incompatibilities for changes to private classes, methods or fields as that access can only occur from within the same class (i.e. the same compilation unit).</p><p>Clirr does not report binary incompatibility WARNINGs or ERRORs for package-scoped items either, because Java packages are intended to be "release units", i.e. all classes within a package are compiled together (ensuring compatibility) then released as a unit. The only time that package-scope incompatibilities could possibly be an issue is when users of a library write their own classes using a package declaration belonging to some external library, or when a subset of updated classes (e.g. a single class) from a package is used to override certain classes from a previous release of the library. Both of these situations are considered very poor practice by Java programming convention.</p><p>In the following sections, the term "old" is used to refer to a class, interface, method or field from the set of jars which represent the old/previous/original/baseline version of the library being inspected. The term "new" is used to refer to a class, interface, method or field from the set of jars which represent the new/current/latest version of the library being inspected.</p><p>In the following sections, the term "type" is used to refer to something which may be either a class or interface.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Severity: INFO</p><p>The specified type exists in both versions, but its declared access specifier has changed to relax restrictions on what other code can access it.</p><p>Top-level types (ie those which are not nested within another class) may only have "package" or "public" accessibility. Nested types can take on any of the four available accessibility values.</p><p>Regardless of whether the object is top-level or nested, a change in accessibility from left-to-right of the sequence private-&gt;package-&gt;protected-&gt;public always ensures that all code which could previously access that type can still access that type. Therefore such a change is always binary and source-code compatible.</p><p>Note that the declaration "protected" provides access to both code derived from the type and to code within the same package, ie "protected" accessibility also implies package accessibility.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Severity: ERROR</p><p>The specified type exists in both versions, but its declared access specifier has changed to tighten the restrictions on what other code may access it.</p><p>Top-level types (ie those which are not nested within another class) may only have "package" or "public" accessibility. Nested types can take on any of the four available accessibility values.</p><p>Regardless of whether the type is top-level or nested, a change in accessibility from left-to-right of the sequence public-&gt;protected-&gt;package-&gt;private may cause existing code which could previously access the type to no longer be able to do so.</p><p>Section 13.4.3 of the Java Language Specification states explicitly that an IllegalAccessError should occur if a pre-existing binary tries to access a type when the type accessibility has been changed to something that would cause a compile-time error. However this does not appear to be enforced in practice, at least in current JVMs. Nevertheless this should be an error, and so clirr reports this change as a binary-compatibility ERROR.</p>
