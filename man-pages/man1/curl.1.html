        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">SYNOPSIS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>curl [options]</strong> <em>[URL...]</em></p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>curl</strong> is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP).  The command is designed to work without user interaction.</p><p>curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authentication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file transfer resume, Metalink, and more. As you will see below, the number of features will make your head spin!</p><p>curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See <a href="../man3/libcurl.3.html"><strong>libcurl</strong>(3)</a> for details.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">URL</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You'll find a detailed description in RFC 3986.</p><p>You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing part sets within braces as in:</p><p> http://site.{one,two,three}.com</p><p>or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:</p><p> ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt  ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt    (with leading zeros)  ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt</p><p>Nested sequences are not supported, but you can use several ones next to each other:</p><p> http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html</p><p>You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They will be fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order.</p><p>You can specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number or letter:</p><p> http://www.numericals.com/file[1-100:10].txt  http://www.letters.com/file[a-z:2].txt</p><p>If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix, curl will attempt to guess what protocol you might want. It will then default to HTTP but try other protocols based on often-used host name prefixes. For example, for host names starting with "ftp." curl will assume you want to speak FTP.</p><p>curl will do its best to use what you pass to it as a URL. It is not trying to validate it as a syntactically correct URL by any means but is instead <strong>very</strong> liberal with what it accepts.</p><p>curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so that getting many files from the same server will not do multiple connects / handshakes. This improves speed. Of course this is only done on files specified on a single command line and cannot be used between separate curl invokes.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">PROGRESS METER</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>curl normally displays a progress meter during operations, indicating the amount of transferred data, transfer speeds and estimated time left, etc.</p><p>curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so if you invoke curl to do an operation and it is about to write data to the terminal, it <em>disables</em> the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the output mixing progress meter and response data.</p><p>If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to redirect the response output to a file, using shell redirect (&gt;), -o [file] or similar.</p><p>It is not the same case for FTP upload as that operation does not spit out any response data to the terminal.</p><p>If you prefer a progress "bar" instead of the regular meter, <em>-#</em> is your friend.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the options require an additional value next to them.</p><p>The short "single-dash" form of the options, -d for example, may be used with or without a space between it and its value, although a space is a recommended separator. The long "double-dash" form, --data for example, requires a space between it and its value.</p><p>Short version options that don't need any additional values can be used immediately next to each other, like for example you can specify all the options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.</p><p>In general, all boolean options are enabled with --<strong>option</strong> and yet again disabled with --<strong>no-</strong>option. That is, you use the exact same option name but prefix it with "no-". However, in this list we mostly only list and show the --option version of them. (This concept with --no options was added in 7.19.0. Previously most options were toggled on/off on repeated use of the same command line option.)</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    -#, --progress-bar
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Make curl display progress as a simple progress bar instead of the standard, more informational, meter.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -:, --next
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Tells curl to use a separate operation for the following URL and associated options. This allows you to send several URL requests, each with their own specific options, for example, such as different user names or custom requests for each. (Added in 7.36.0)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -0, --http1.0
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.0 instead of using its internally preferred: HTTP 1.1.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --http1.1
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.1. This is the internal default version. (Added in 7.33.0)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --http2
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Tells curl to issue its requests using HTTP 2. This requires that the underlying libcurl was built to support it. (Added in 7.33.0)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --no-npn
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Disable the NPN TLS extension. NPN is enabled by default if libcurl was built with an SSL library that supports NPN. NPN is used by a libcurl that supports HTTP 2 to negotiate HTTP 2 support with the server during https sessions.</p><p>(Added in 7.36.0)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --no-alpn
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Disable the ALPN TLS extension. ALPN is enabled by default if libcurl was built with an SSL library that supports ALPN. ALPN is used by a libcurl that supports HTTP 2 to negotiate HTTP 2 support with the server during https sessions.</p><p>(Added in 7.36.0)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -1, --tlsv1
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SSL) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.x when negotiating with a remote TLS server. You can use options <em>--tlsv1.0</em>, <em>--tlsv1.1</em>, and <em>--tlsv1.2</em> to control the TLS version more precisely (if the SSL backend in use supports such a level of control).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -2, --sslv2
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 2 when negotiating with a remote SSL server.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -3, --sslv3
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 3 when negotiating with a remote SSL server.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -4, --ipv4
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If curl is capable of resolving an address to multiple IP versions (which it is if it is IPv6-capable), this option tells curl to resolve names to IPv4 addresses only.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -6, --ipv6
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If curl is capable of resolving an address to multiple IP versions (which it is if it is IPv6-capable), this option tells curl to resolve names to IPv6 addresses only.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -a, --append
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP/SFTP) When used in an upload, this will tell curl to append to the target file instead of overwriting it. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. Note that this flag is ignored by some SSH servers (including OpenSSH).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -A, --user-agent &lt;agent string&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server. Some badly done CGIs fail if this field isn't set to "Mozilla/4.0". To encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single quote marks. This can also be set with the <em>-H, --header</em> option of course.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --anyauth
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself, and use the most secure one the remote site claims to support. This is done by first doing a request and checking the response-headers, thus possibly inducing an extra network round-trip. This is used instead of setting a specific authentication method, which you can do with <em>--basic</em>, <em>--digest</em>, <em>--ntlm</em>, and <em>--negotiate</em>.</p><p>Note that using --anyauth is not recommended if you do uploads from stdin, since it may require data to be sent twice and then the client must be able to rewind. If the need should arise when uploading from stdin, the upload operation will fail.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -b, --cookie &lt;name=data&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server as a cookie. It is supposedly the data previously received from the server in a "Set-Cookie:" line. The data should be in the format "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2".</p><p>If no '=' symbol is used in the line, it is treated as a filename to use to read previously stored cookie lines from, which should be used in this session if they match. Using this method also activates the "cookie parser" which will make curl record incoming cookies too, which may be handy if you're using this in combination with the <em>-L, --location</em> option. The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain HTTP headers or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format.</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong> that the file specified with <em>-b, --cookie</em> is only used as input. No cookies will be stored in the file. To store cookies, use the <em>-c, --cookie-jar</em> option or you could even save the HTTP headers to a file using <em>-D, --dump-header</em>!</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -B, --use-ascii
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP/LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also be enforced by using an URL that ends with ";type=A". This option causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --basic
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication. This is the default and this option is usually pointless, unless you use it to override a previously set option that sets a different authentication method (such as <em>--ntlm</em>, <em>--digest</em>, or <em>--negotiate</em>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -c, --cookie-jar &lt;file name&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all cookies after a completed operation. Curl writes all cookies previously read from a specified file as well as all cookies received from remote server(s). If no cookies are known, no file will be written. The file will be written using the Netscape cookie file format. If you set the file name to a single dash, "-", the cookies will be written to stdout.</p><p>This command line option will activate the cookie engine that makes curl record and use cookies. Another way to activate it is to use the <em>-b,</em> --cookie option.</p><p>If the cookie jar can't be created or written to, the whole curl operation won't fail or even report an error clearly. Using -v will get a warning displayed, but that is the only visible feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last specified file name will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -C, --continue-at &lt;offset&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at the given offset. The given offset is the exact number of bytes that will be skipped, counting from the beginning of the source file before it is transferred to the destination.  If used with uploads, the FTP server command SIZE will not be used by curl.</p><p>Use "-C -" to tell curl to automatically find out where/how to resume the transfer. It then uses the given output/input files to figure that out.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --ciphers &lt;list of ciphers&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SSL) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list of ciphers must specify valid ciphers. Read up on SSL cipher list details on this URL: <em>http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</em></p><p>NSS ciphers are done differently than OpenSSL and GnuTLS. The full list of NSS ciphers is in the NSSCipherSuite entry at this URL: <em>http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/mod_nss.git/plain/docs/mod_nss.html#Directives</em></p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --compressed
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms curl supports, and save the uncompressed document.  If this option is used and the server sends an unsupported encoding, curl will report an error.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --connect-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Maximum time in seconds that you allow the connection to the server to take. This only limits the connection phase, once curl has connected this option is of no more use.  Since 7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values, but the actual timeout will decrease in accuracy as the specified timeout increases in decimal precision. See also the <em>-m, --max-time</em> option.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --create-dirs
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When used in conjunction with the <em>-o</em> option, curl will create the necessary local directory hierarchy as needed. This option creates the dirs mentioned with the <em>-o</em> option, nothing else. If the <em>-o</em> file name uses no dir or if the dirs it mentions already exist, no dir will be created.</p><p>To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try <em>--ftp-create-dirs</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --crlf
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP) Convert LF to CRLF in upload. Useful for MVS (OS/390).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --crlfile &lt;file&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTPS/FTPS) Provide a file using PEM format with a Certificate Revocation List that may specify peer certificates that are to be considered revoked.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p><p>(Added in 7.19.7)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -d, --data &lt;data&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Sends the specified data in a POST request to the HTTP server, in the same way that a browser does when a user has filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This will cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Compare to <em>-F, --form</em>.</p><p><em>-d, --data</em> is the same as <em>--data-ascii</em>. To post data purely binary, you should instead use the <em>--data-binary</em> option. To URL-encode the value of a form field you may use <em>--data-urlencode</em>.</p><p>If any of these options is used more than once on the same command line, the data pieces specified will be merged together with a separating &-symbol. Thus, using '-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy' would generate a post chunk that looks like 'name=daniel&skill=lousy'.</p><p>If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl to read the data from stdin. Multiple files can also be specified. Posting data from a file named 'foobar' would thus be done with <em>--data</em> @foobar. When --data is told to read from a file like that, carriage returns and newlines will be stripped out.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -D, --dump-header &lt;file&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Write the protocol headers to the specified file.</p><p>This option is handy to use when you want to store the headers that an HTTP site sends to you. Cookies from the headers could then be read in a second curl invocation by using the <em>-b, --cookie</em> option! The <em>-c, --cookie-jar</em> option is however a better way to store cookies.</p><p>When used in FTP, the FTP server response lines are considered being "headers" and thus are saved there.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --data-ascii &lt;data&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>See <em>-d, --data</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --data-binary &lt;data&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) This posts data exactly as specified with no extra processing whatsoever.</p><p>If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a filename.  Data is posted in a similar manner as <em>--data-ascii</em> does, except that newlines and carriage returns are preserved and conversions are never done.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the ones following the first will append data as described in <em>-d, --data</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --data-urlencode &lt;data&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) This posts data, similar to the other --data options with the exception that this performs URL-encoding. (Added in 7.18.0)</p><p>To be CGI-compliant, the &lt;data&gt; part should begin with a <em>name</em> followed by a separator and a content specification. The &lt;data&gt; part can be passed to curl using one of the following syntaxes:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    content
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that on. Just be careful so that the content doesn't contain any = or @ symbols, as that will then make the syntax match one of the other cases below!</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    =content
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that on. The preceding = symbol is not included in the data.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    name=content
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This will make curl URL-encode the content part and pass that on. Note that the name part is expected to be URL-encoded already.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    @filename
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This will make curl load data from the given file (including any newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it on in the POST.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    name@filename
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This will make curl load data from the given file (including any newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it on in the POST. The name part gets an equal sign appended, resulting in <em>name=urlencoded-file-content</em>. Note that the name is expected to be URL-encoded already.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    --delegation LEVEL
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set <em>LEVEL</em> to tell the server what it is allowed to delegate when it comes to user credentials. Used with GSS/kerberos.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>

  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is an authentication scheme that prevents the password from being sent over the wire in clear text. Use this in combination with the normal <em>-u, --user</em> option to set user name and password. See also <em>--ntlm</em>, <em>--negotiate</em> and <em>--anyauth</em> for related options.</p><p>If this option is used several times, only the first one is used.</p>

    --disable-eprt
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands when doing active FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first attempt to use EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but with this option, it will use PORT right away. EPRT and LPRT are extensions to the original FTP protocol, and may not work on all servers, but they enable more functionality in a better way than the traditional PORT command.</p><p><strong>--eprt</strong> can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and <strong>--no-eprt</strong> is an alias for <strong>--disable-eprt</strong>.</p><p>Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you want to switch to passive mode you need to not use <em>-P, --ftp-port</em> or force it with <em>--ftp-pasv</em>.</p>

    <p>Tell curl to send outgoing DNS requests through &lt;interface&gt;. This option is a counterpart to <em>--interface</em> (which does not affect DNS). The supplied string must be an interface name (not an address).</p><p>This option requires that libcurl was built with a resolver backend that supports this operation.

    <p>(HTTP) Sends the "Referrer Page" information to the HTTP server. This can also be set with the <em>-H, --header</em> flag of course.  When used with <em>-L, --location</em> you can append ";auto" to the --referer URL to make curl automatically set the previous URL when it follows a Location: header. The ";auto" string can be used alone, even if you don't set an initial --referer.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -E, --cert &lt;certificate[:password]&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SSL) Tells curl to use the specified client certificate file when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another SSL-based protocol. The certificate must be in PKCS#12 format if using Secure Transport, or PEM format if using any other engine.  If the optional password isn't specified, it will be queried for on the terminal. Note that this option assumes a "certificate" file that is the private key and the private certificate concatenated! See <em>--cert</em> and <em>--key</em> to specify them independently.</p><p>If curl is built against the NSS SSL library then this option can tell curl the nickname of the certificate to use within the NSS database defined by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or by default /etc/pki/nssdb). If the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) is available then PEM files may be loaded. If you want to use a file from the current directory, please precede it with "./" prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.  If the nickname contains ":", it needs to be preceded by " recognized as password delimiter.  If the nickname contains " be escaped as "&#92;</p><p>(iOS and Mac OS X only) If curl is built against Secure Transport, then the certificate string can either be the name of a certificate/private key in the system or user keychain, or the path to a PKCS#12-encoded certificate and private key. If you want to use a file from the current directory, please precede it with "./" prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    --cert-type &lt;type&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SSL) Tells curl what certificate type the provided certificate is in. PEM, DER and ENG are recognized types.  If not specified, PEM is assumed.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --cacert &lt;CA certificate&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SSL) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify the peer. The file may contain multiple CA certificates. The certificate(s) must be in PEM format. Normally curl is built to use a default file for this, so this option is typically used to alter that default file.</p><p>curl recognizes the environment variable named 'CURL_CA_BUNDLE' if it is set, and uses the given path as a path to a CA cert bundle. This option overrides that variable.</p><p>The windows version of curl will automatically look for a CA certs file named \'curl-ca-bundle.crt\', either in the same directory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any folder along your PATH.</p><p>If curl is built against the NSS SSL library, the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) needs to be available for this option to work properly.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --capath &lt;CA certificate directory&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SSL) Tells curl to use the specified certificate directory to verify the peer. Multiple paths can be provided by separating them with ":" (e.g. "path1:path2:path3"). The certificates must be in PEM format, and if curl is built against OpenSSL, the directory must have been processed using the c_rehash utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using <em>--capath</em> can allow OpenSSL-powered curl to make SSL-connections much more efficiently than using <em>--cacert</em> if the <em>--cacert</em> file contains many CA certificates.</p><p>If this option is set, the default capath value will be ignored, and if it is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -f, --fail
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server errors. This is mostly done to better enable scripts etc to better deal with failed attempts. In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document stating so (which often also describes why and more). This flag will prevent curl from outputting that and return error 22.</p><p>This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-successful response codes will slip through, especially when authentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -F, --form &lt;name=content&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) This lets curl emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the submit button. This causes curl to POST data using the Content-Type multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388. This enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the 'content' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with the symbol &lt;. The difference between @ and &lt; is then that @ makes a file get attached in the post as a file upload, while the &lt; makes a text field and just get the contents for that text field from a file.</p><p>Example, to send your password file to the server, where 'password' is the name of the form-field to which /etc/passwd will be the input:</p><p><strong>curl</strong> -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com</p><p>To read content from stdin instead of a file, use - as the filename. This goes for both @ and &lt; constructs.</p><p>You can also tell curl what Content-Type to use by using 'type=', in a manner similar to:</p><p><strong>curl</strong> -F "web=@index.html;type=text/html" url.com</p><p>or</p><p><strong>curl</strong> -F "name=daniel;type=text/foo" url.com</p><p>You can also explicitly change the name field of a file upload part by setting filename=, like this:</p><p><strong>curl</strong> -F "file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost" url.com</p><p>If filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by double-quotes like:</p><p><strong>curl</strong> -F "file=@  or</p><p><strong>curl</strong> -F 'file=@"localfile";filename="nameinpost"' url.com</p><p>Note that if a filename/path is quoted by double-quotes, any double-quote or backslash within the filename must be escaped by backslash.</p><p>See further examples and details in the MANUAL.</p><p>This option can be used multiple times.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --ftp-account [data]
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP) When an FTP server asks for "account data" after user name and password has been provided, this data is sent off using the ACCT command. (Added in 7.13.0)</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --ftp-alternative-to-user &lt;command&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP) If authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails, send this command.  When connecting to Tumbleweed's Secure Transport server over FTPS using a client certificate, using "SITE AUTH" will tell the server to retrieve the username from the certificate. (Added in 7.15.5)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --ftp-create-dirs
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP/SFTP) When an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses a path that doesn't currently exist on the server, the standard behavior of curl is to fail. Using this option, curl will instead attempt to create missing directories.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --ftp-method [method]
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file on an FTP(S) server. The method argument should be one of the following alternatives:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    multicwd
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>curl does a single CWD operation for each path part in the given URL. For deep hierarchies this means very many commands. This is how RFC 1738 says it should be done. This is the default but the slowest behavior.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    nocwd
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>curl does no CWD at all. curl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR etc and give a full path to the server for all these commands. This is the fastest behavior.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    singlecwd
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>curl does one CWD with the full target directory and then operates on the file "normally" (like in the multicwd case). This is somewhat more standards compliant than 'nocwd' but without the full penalty of 'multicwd'.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>(Added in 7.15.1)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --ftp-pasv
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP) Use passive mode for the data connection. Passive is the internal default behavior, but using this option can be used to override a previous <em>-P/-ftp-port</em> option. (Added in 7.11.0)</p><p>If this option is used several times, only the first one is used. Undoing an enforced passive really isn't doable but you must then instead enforce the correct <em>-P, --ftp-port</em> again.</p><p>Passive mode means that curl will try the EPSV command first and then PASV, unless <em>--disable-epsv</em> is used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --ftp-skip-pasv-ip
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server suggests in its response to curl's PASV command when curl connects the data connection. Instead curl will re-use the same IP address it already uses for the control connection. (Added in 7.14.2)</p><p>This option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead of PASV.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --ftp-pret
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP) Tell curl to send a PRET command before PASV (and EPSV). Certain FTP servers, mainly drftpd, require this non-standard command for directory listings as well as up and downloads in PASV mode. (Added in 7.20.x)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --ftp-ssl-ccc
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP) Use CCC (Clear Command Channel) Shuts down the SSL/TLS layer after authenticating. The rest of the control channel communication will be unencrypted. This allows NAT routers to follow the FTP transaction. The default mode is passive. See <em>--ftp-ssl-ccc-mode</em> for other modes. (Added in 7.16.1)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode [active/passive]
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP) Use CCC (Clear Command Channel) Sets the CCC mode. The passive mode will not initiate the shutdown, but instead wait for the server to do it, and will not reply to the shutdown from the server. The active mode initiates the shutdown and waits for a reply from the server. (Added in 7.16.2)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --ftp-ssl-control
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the FTP login, clear for transfer.  Allows secure authentication, but non-encrypted data transfers for efficiency.  Fails the transfer if the server doesn't support SSL/TLS.  (Added in 7.16.0) that can still be used but will be removed in a future version.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --form-string &lt;name=string&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Similar to <em>--form</em> except that the value string for the named parameter is used literally. Leading '@' and '&lt;' characters, and the ';type=' string in the value have no special meaning. Use this in preference to <em>--form</em> if there's any possibility that the string value may accidentally trigger the '@' or '&lt;' features of <em>--form</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -g, --globoff
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option switches off the "URL globbing parser". When you set this option, you can specify URLs that contain the letters {}[] without having them being interpreted by curl itself. Note that these letters are not normal legal URL contents but they should be encoded according to the URI standard.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -G, --get
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When used, this option will make all data specified with <em>-d, --data</em>, <em>--data-binary</em> or <em>--data-urlencode</em> to be used in an HTTP GET request instead of the POST request that otherwise would be used. The data will be appended to the URL with a '?' separator.</p><p>If used in combination with -I, the POST data will instead be appended to the URL with a HEAD request.</p><p>If this option is used several times, only the first one is used. This is because undoing a GET doesn't make sense, but you should then instead enforce the alternative method you prefer.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -H, --header &lt;header&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending HTTP to a server. You may specify any number of extra headers. Note that if you should add a custom header that has the same name as one of the internal ones curl would use, your externally set header will be used instead of the internal one. This allows you to make even trickier stuff than curl would normally do. You should not replace internally set headers without knowing perfectly well what you're doing. Remove an internal header by giving a replacement without content on the right side of the colon, as in: -H "Host:". If you send the custom header with no-value then its header must be terminated with a semicolon, such as -H "X-Custom-Header;" to send "X-Custom-Header:".</p><p>curl will make sure that each header you add/replace is sent with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus <strong>not</strong> add that as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage returns, they will only mess things up for you.</p><p>See also the <em>-A, --user-agent</em> and <em>-e, --referer</em> options.</p><p>Starting in 7.37.0, you need <em>--proxy-header</em> to send custom headers intended for a proxy.</p><p>Example:</p><p># curl -H "X-First-Name: Joe" http://192.168.0.1/</p><p>This option can be used multiple times to add/replace/remove multiple headers.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --hostpubmd5 &lt;md5&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SCP/SFTP) Pass a string containing 32 hexadecimal digits. The string should be the 128 bit MD5 checksum of the remote host's public key, curl will refuse the connection with the host unless the md5sums match. (Added in 7.17.1)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --ignore-content-length
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Ignore the Content-Length header. This is particularly useful for servers running Apache 1.x, which will report incorrect Content-Length for files larger than 2 gigabytes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -i, --include
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Include the HTTP-header in the output. The HTTP-header includes things like server-name, date of the document, HTTP-version and more...</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -I, --head
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP/FTP/FILE) Fetch the HTTP-header only! HTTP-servers feature the command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of a document. When used on an FTP or FILE file, curl displays the file size and last modification time only.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --interface &lt;name&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Perform an operation using a specified interface. You can enter interface name, IP address or host name. An example could look like:</p><p> curl --interface eth0:1 http://www.netscape.com/</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -j, --junk-session-cookies
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this option will make it discard all "session cookies". This will basically have the same effect as if a new session is started. Typical browsers always discard session cookies when they're closed down.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -J, --remote-header-name
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) This option tells the <em>-O, --remote-name</em> option to use the server-specified Content-Disposition filename instead of extracting a filename from the URL.</p><p>There's no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in the provided file name, so this option may provide you with rather unexpected file names.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -k, --insecure
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SSL) This option explicitly allows curl to perform "insecure" SSL connections and transfers. All SSL connections are attempted to be made secure by using the CA certificate bundle installed by default. This makes all connections considered "insecure" fail unless <em>-k, --insecure</em> is used.</p><p>See this online resource for further details: <strong>http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html</strong></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -K, --config &lt;config file&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify which config file to read curl arguments from. The config file is a text file in which command line arguments can be written which then will be used as if they were written on the actual command line.</p><p>Options and their parameters must be specified on the same config file line, separated by whitespace, colon, or the equals sign. Long option names can optionally be given in the config file without the initial double dashes and if so, the colon or equals characters can be used as separators. If the option is specified with one or two dashes, there can be no colon or equals character between the option and its parameter.</p><p>If the parameter is to contain whitespace, the parameter must be enclosed within quotes. Within double quotes, the following escape sequences are available: &#92;&#92;,  letter is ignored. If the first column of a config line is a '#' character, the rest of the line will be treated as a comment. Only write one option per physical line in the config file.</p><p>Specify the filename to -K, --config as '-' to make curl read the file from stdin.</p><p>Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config file, you need to specify it using the <em>--url</em> option, and not by simply writing the URL on its own line. So, it could look similar to this:</p><p>url = "http://curl.haxx.se/docs/"</p><p>When curl is invoked, it always (unless <em>-q</em> is used) checks for a default config file and uses it if found. The default config file is checked for in the following places in this order:</p><p>1) curl tries to find the "home dir": It first checks for the CURL_HOME and then the HOME environment variables. Failing that, it uses getpwuid() on UNIX-like systems (which returns the home dir given the current user in your system). On Windows, it then checks for the APPDATA variable, or as a last resort the '%USERPROFILE%&#92;Application Data'.</p><p>2) On windows, if there is no _curlrc file in the home dir, it checks for one in the same dir the curl executable is placed. On UNIX-like systems, it will simply try to load .curlrc from the determined home dir.</p>
<pre>
# --- Example file ---
# this is a comment
url = "curl.haxx.se"
output = "curlhere.html"
user-agent = "superagent/1.0"

# and fetch another URL too
url = "curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html"
-O
referer = "http://nowhereatall.com/"
# --- End of example file ---
</pre>
<p>This option can be used multiple times to load multiple config files.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --keepalive-time &lt;seconds&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option sets the time a connection needs to remain idle before sending keepalive probes and the time between individual keepalive probes. It is currently effective on operating systems offering the TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL socket options (meaning Linux, recent AIX, HP-UX and more). This option has no effect if <em>--no-keepalive</em> is used. (Added in 7.18.0)</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --key &lt;key&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SSL/SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your private key in this separate file.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --key-type &lt;type&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SSL) Private key file type. Specify which type your <em>--key</em> provided private key is. DER, PEM, and ENG are supported. If not specified, PEM is assumed.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --krb &lt;level&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP) Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level must be entered and should be one of 'clear', 'safe', 'confidential', or 'private'. Should you use a level that is not one of these, 'private' will instead be used.</p><p>This option requires a library built with kerberos4 support. This is not very common. Use <em>-V, --version</em> to see if your curl supports it.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -l, --list-only
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP) When listing an FTP directory, this switch forces a name-only view. This is especially useful if the user wants to machine-parse the contents of an FTP directory since the normal directory view doesn't use a standard look or format. When used like this, the option causes a NLST command to be sent to the server instead of LIST.</p><p>Note: Some FTP servers list only files in their response to NLST; they do not include sub-directories and symbolic links.</p><p>(POP3) When retrieving a specific email from POP3, this switch forces a LIST command to be performed instead of RETR. This is particularly useful if the user wants to see if a specific message id exists on the server and what size it is.</p><p>Note: When combined with <em>-X, --request &lt;command&gt;</em>, this option can be used to send an UIDL command instead, so the user may use the email's unique identifier rather than it's message id to make the request. (Added in 7.21.5)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -L, --location
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP/HTTPS) If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response code), this option will make curl redo the request on the new place. If used together with <em>-i, --include</em> or <em>-I, --head</em>, headers from all requested pages will be shown. When authentication is used, curl only sends its credentials to the initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different host, it won't be able to intercept the user+password. See also <em>--location-trusted</em> on how to change this. You can limit the amount of redirects to follow by using the <em>--max-redirs</em> option.</p><p>When curl follows a redirect and the request is not a plain GET (for example POST or PUT), it will do the following request with a GET if the HTTP response was 301, 302, or 303. If the response code was any other 3xx code, curl will re-send the following request using the same unmodified method.</p><p>You can tell curl to not change the non-GET request method to GET after a 30x response by using the dedicated options for that: <em>--post301</em>, <em>--post302</em> and <em>-post303</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --libcurl &lt;file&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Append this option to any ordinary curl command line, and you will get a libcurl-using C source code written to the file that does the equivalent of what your command-line operation does!</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last given file name will be used. (Added in 7.16.1)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --limit-rate &lt;speed&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify the maximum transfer rate you want curl to use - for both downloads and uploads. This feature is useful if you have a limited pipe and you'd like your transfer not to use your entire bandwidth. To make it slower than it otherwise would be.</p><p>The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix is appended. Appending 'k' or 'K' will count the number as kilobytes, 'm' or M' makes it megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.</p><p>The given rate is the average speed counted during the entire transfer. It means that curl might use higher transfer speeds in short bursts, but over time it uses no more than the given rate.</p><p>If you also use the <em>-Y, --speed-limit</em> option, that option will take precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to help keeping the speed-limit logic working.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --local-port &lt;num&gt;[-num]
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set a preferred number or range of local port numbers to use for the connection(s).  Note that port numbers by nature are a scarce resource that will be busy at times so setting this range to something too narrow might cause unnecessary connection setup failures. (Added in 7.15.2)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --location-trusted
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP/HTTPS) Like <em>-L, --location</em>, but will allow sending the name + password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This may or may not introduce a security breach if the site redirects you to a site to which you'll send your authentication info (which is plaintext in the case of HTTP Basic authentication).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -m, --max-time &lt;seconds&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Maximum time in seconds that you allow the whole operation to take.  This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from hanging for hours due to slow networks or links going down.  Since 7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values, but the actual timeout will decrease in accuracy as the specified timeout increases in decimal precision.  See also the <em>--connect-timeout</em> option.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --login-options &lt;options&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify the login options to use during server authentication.</p><p>You can use the login options to specify protocol specific options that may be used during authentication. At present only IMAP, POP3 and SMTP support login options. For more information about the login options please see RFC 2384, RFC 5092 and IETF draft draft-earhart-url-smtp-00.txt (Added in 7.34.0).</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --mail-auth &lt;address&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SMTP) Specify a single address. This will be used to specify the authentication address (identity) of a submitted message that is being relayed to another server.</p><p>(Added in 7.25.0)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --mail-from &lt;address&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SMTP) Specify a single address that the given mail should get sent from.</p><p>(Added in 7.20.0)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --max-filesize &lt;bytes&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a file to download. If the file requested is larger than this value, the transfer will not start and curl will return with exit code 63.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The file size is not always known prior to download, and for such files this option has no effect even if the file transfer ends up being larger than this given limit. This concerns both FTP and HTTP transfers.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --mail-rcpt &lt;address&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SMTP) Specify a single address, user name or mailing list name.</p><p>When performing a mail transfer, the recipient should specify a valid email address to send the mail to. (Added in 7.20.0)</p><p>When performing an address verification (VRFY command), the recipient should be specified as the user name or user name and domain (as per Section 3.5 of RFC5321). (Added in 7.34.0)</p><p>When performing a mailing list expand (EXPN command), the recipient should be specified using the mailing list name, such as "Friends" or "London-Office". (Added in 7.34.0)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --max-redirs &lt;num&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set maximum number of redirection-followings allowed. If <em>-L, --location</em> is used, this option can be used to prevent curl from following redirections "in absurdum". By default, the limit is set to 50 redirections. Set this option to -1 to make it limitless.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --metalink
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option can tell curl to parse and process a given URI as Metalink file (both version 3 and 4 (RFC 5854) are supported) and make use of the mirrors listed within for failover if there are errors (such as the file or server not being available). It will also verify the hash of the file after the download completes. The Metalink file itself is downloaded and processed in memory and not stored in the local file system.</p><p>Example to use a remote Metalink file:</p><p><strong>curl</strong> --metalink http://www.example.com/example.metalink</p><p>To use a Metalink file in the local file system, use FILE protocol (file://):</p><p><strong>curl</strong> --metalink file://example.metalink</p><p>Please note that if FILE protocol is disabled, there is no way to use a local Metalink file at the time of this writing. Also note that if <em>--metalink</em> and <em>--include</em> are used together, <em>--include</em> will be ignored. This is because including headers in the response will break Metalink parser and if the headers are included in the file described in Metalink file, hash check will fail.</p><p>(Added in 7.27.0, if built against the libmetalink library.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -n, --netrc
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Makes curl scan the <em>.netrc</em> (<em>_netrc</em> on Windows) file in the user's home directory for login name and password. This is typically used for FTP on UNIX. If used with HTTP, curl will enable user authentication. See <strong>netrc</strong>(4)</strong> or <strong>ftp</strong>(1)</strong> for details on the file format. Curl will not complain if that file doesn't have the right permissions (it should not be either world- or group-readable). The environment variable "HOME" is used to find the home directory.</p><p>A quick and very simple example of how to setup a <em>.netrc</em> to allow curl to FTP to the machine host.domain.com with user name 'myself' and password 'secret' should look similar to:</p><p><strong>machine host.domain.com login myself password secret</strong></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -N, --no-buffer
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work situations, curl will use a standard buffered output stream that will have the effect that it will output the data in chunks, not necessarily exactly when the data arrives. Using this option will disable that buffering.</p><p>Note that this is the negated option name documented. You can thus use <em>--buffer</em> to enforce the buffering.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --netrc-file
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option is similar to <em>--netrc</em>, except that you provide the path (absolute or relative) to the netrc file that Curl should use. You can only specify one netrc file per invocation. If several <em>--netrc-file</em> options are provided, only the <strong>last one</strong> will be used. (Added in 7.21.5)</p><p>This option overrides any use of <em>--netrc</em> as they are mutually exclusive. It will also abide by <em>--netrc-optional</em> if specified.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --netrc-optional
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Very similar to <em>--netrc</em>, but this option makes the .netrc usage <strong>optional</strong> and not mandatory as the <em>--netrc</em> option does.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --negotiate
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Enables Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication.</p><p>If you want to enable Negotiate (SPNEGO) for proxy authentication, then use <em>--proxy-negotiate</em>.</p><p>This option requires a library built with GSS-API or SSPI support. Use <em>-V,</em> --version to see if your curl supports GSS-API/SSPI and SPNEGO.</p><p>When using this option, you must also provide a fake <em>-u, --user</em> option to activate the authentication code properly. Sending a '-u :' is enough as the user name and password from the <em>-u</em> option aren't actually used.</p><p>If this option is used several times, only the first one is used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --no-keepalive
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Disables the use of keepalive messages on the TCP connection, as by default curl enables them.</p><p>Note that this is the negated option name documented. You can thus use <em>--keepalive</em> to enforce keepalive.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --no-sessionid
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SSL) Disable curl's use of SSL session-ID caching.  By default all transfers are done using the cache. Note that while nothing should ever get hurt by attempting to reuse SSL session-IDs, there seem to be broken SSL implementations in the wild that may require you to disable this in order for you to succeed. (Added in 7.16.0)</p><p>Note that this is the negated option name documented. You can thus use <em>--sessionid</em> to enforce session-ID caching.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --noproxy &lt;no-proxy-list&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Comma-separated list of hosts which do not use a proxy, if one is specified. The only wildcard is a single * character, which matches all hosts, and effectively disables the proxy. Each name in this list is matched as either a domain which contains the hostname, or the hostname itself. For example, local.com would match local.com, local.com:80, and www.local.com, but not www.notlocal.com.  (Added in 7.19.4).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --ntlm
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Enables NTLM authentication. The NTLM authentication method was designed by Microsoft and is used by IIS web servers. It is a proprietary protocol, reverse-engineered by clever people and implemented in curl based on their efforts. This kind of behavior should not be endorsed, you should encourage everyone who uses NTLM to switch to a public and documented authentication method instead, such as Digest.</p><p>If you want to enable NTLM for your proxy authentication, then use <em>--proxy-ntlm</em>.</p><p>This option requires a library built with SSL support. Use <em>-V, --version</em> to see if your curl supports NTLM.</p><p>If this option is used several times, only the first one is used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -o, --output &lt;file&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Write output to &lt;file&gt; instead of stdout. If you are using {} or [] to fetch multiple documents, you can use '#' followed by a number in the &lt;file&gt; specifier. That variable will be replaced with the current string for the URL being fetched. Like in:</p>
<pre>
  curl http://{one,two}.site.com -o "file_#1.txt"
</pre>
<p>or use several variables like:</p>
<pre>
  curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o "#1_#2"
</pre>
<p>You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have.</p><p>See also the <em>--create-dirs</em> option to create the local directories dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a single dash) will force the output to be done to stdout.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -O, --remote-name
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Write output to a local file named like the remote file we get. (Only the file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut off.)</p><p>The remote file name to use for saving is extracted from the given URL, nothing else.</p><p>Consequentially, the file will be saved in the current working directory. If you want the file saved in a different directory, make sure you change current working directory before you invoke curl with the <strong>-O, --remote-name</strong> flag!</p><p>There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has %20 or other URL encoded parts of the name, they will end up as-is as file name.</p><p>You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --oauth2-bearer
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(IMAP, POP3, SMTP) Specify the Bearer Token for OAUTH 2.0 server authentication. The Bearer Token is used in conjunction with the user name which can be specified as part of the <em>--url</em> or <em>-u, --user</em> options.</p><p>The Bearer Token and user name are formatted according to RFC 6750.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --proxy-header &lt;header&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending HTTP to a proxy. You may specify any number of extra headers. This is the equivalent option to <em>-H, --header</em> but is for proxy communication only like in CONNECT requests when you want a separate header sent to the proxy to what is sent to the actual remote host.</p><p>curl will make sure that each header you add/replace is sent with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus <strong>not</strong> add that as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage returns, they will only mess things up for you.</p><p>Headers specified with this option will not be included in requests that curl knows will not be sent to a proxy.</p><p>This option can be used multiple times to add/replace/remove multiple headers.</p><p>(Added in 7.37.0)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -p, --proxytunnel
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When an HTTP proxy is used (<em>-x, --proxy</em>), this option will cause non-HTTP protocols to attempt to tunnel through the proxy instead of merely using it to do HTTP-like operations. The tunnel approach is made with the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and requires that the proxy allows direct connect to the remote port number curl wants to tunnel through to.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -P, --ftp-port &lt;address&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP) Reverses the default initiator/listener roles when connecting with FTP. This switch makes curl use active mode. In practice, curl then tells the server to connect back to the client's specified address and port, while passive mode asks the server to setup an IP address and port for it to connect to. &lt;address&gt; should be one of:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    interface
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>i.e "eth0" to specify which interface's IP address you want to use (Unix only)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    IP address
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>i.e "192.168.10.1" to specify the exact IP address</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    host name
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>i.e "my.host.domain" to specify the machine</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>make curl pick the same IP address that is already used for the control connection</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. Disable the use of PORT with <em>--ftp-pasv</em>. Disable the attempt to use the EPRT command instead of PORT by using <em>--disable-eprt</em>. EPRT is really PORT++.</p><p>Starting in 7.19.5, you can append ":[start]-[end]" to the right of the address, to tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means you specify a port range, from a lower to a higher number. A single number works as well, but do note that it increases the risk of failure since the port may not be available.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --pass &lt;phrase&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(SSL/SSH) Passphrase for the private key</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --post301
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 2616/10.3.2 and not convert POST requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection. The non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server may require a POST to remain a POST after such a redirection.

    --proto &lt;protocols&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Tells curl to use the listed protocols for its initial retrieval. Protocols are evaluated left to right, are comma separated, and are each a protocol name or 'all', optionally prefixed by zero or more modifiers. Available modifiers are:</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    --proxy-basic
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication when communicating with the given proxy. Use <em>--basic</em> for enabling HTTP Basic with a remote host. Basic is the default authentication method curl uses with proxies.</p>
  </dd>

    -Q, --quote &lt;command&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(FTP/SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP or SFTP server. Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer takes place (just after the initial PWD command in an FTP transfer, to be exact). To make commands take place after a successful transfer, prefix them with a dash '-'.  To make commands be sent after curl has changed the working directory, just before the transfer command(s), prefix the command with a '+' (this is only supported for FTP). You may specify any number of commands. If the server returns failure for one of the commands, the entire operation will be aborted. You must send syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC 959 defines to FTP servers, or one of the commands listed below to SFTP servers.  This option can be used multiple times. When speaking to an FTP server, prefix the command with an asterisk (*) to make curl continue even if the command fails as by default curl will stop at first failure.</p><p>SFTP is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets SFTP quote commands itself before sending them to the server.  File names may be quoted shell-style to embed spaces or special characters.  Following is the list of all supported SFTP quote commands:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    chgrp group file
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The chgrp command sets the group ID of the file named by the file operand to the group ID specified by the group operand. The group operand is a decimal integer group ID.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    chmod mode file
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The chmod command modifies the file mode bits of the specified file. The mode operand is an octal integer mode number.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    chown user file
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The chown command sets the owner of the file named by the file operand to the user ID specified by the user operand. The user operand is a decimal integer user ID.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    ln source_file target_file
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The ln and symlink commands create a symbolic link at the target_file location pointing to the source_file location.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    mkdir directory_name
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The mkdir command creates the directory named by the directory_name operand.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Make curl sleep this amount of time before each retry when a transfer has failed with a transient error (it changes the default backoff time algorithm between retries). This option is only interesting if <em>--retry</em> is also used. Setting this delay to zero will make curl use the default backoff time.

Notice that if the timer hasn't reached the limit, the request will be made and while performing, it may take longer than this given time period. To limit a single request\'s maximum time, use <em>-m, --max-time</em>. Set this option to zero to not timeout retries.

    -T, --upload-file &lt;file&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This transfers the specified local file to the remote URL. If there is no file part in the specified URL, Curl will append the local file name. NOTE that you must use a trailing / on the last directory to really prove to Curl that there is no file name or curl will think that your last directory name is the remote file name to use. That will most likely cause the upload operation to fail. If this is used on an HTTP(S) server, the PUT command will be used.</p><p>Use the file name "-" (a single dash) to use stdin instead of a given file. Alternately, the file name "." (a single period) may be specified instead of "-" to use stdin in non-blocking mode to allow reading server output while stdin is being uploaded.</p><p>You can specify one -T for each URL on the command line. Each -T + URL pair specifies what to upload and to where. curl also supports "globbing" of the -T argument, meaning that you can upload multiple files to a single URL by using the same URL globbing style supported in the URL, like this:</p><p>curl -T "{file1,file2}" http://www.uploadtothissite.com</p><p>or even</p><p>curl -T "img[1-1000].png" ftp://ftp.picturemania.com/upload/</p>

  <dt>
    -x, --proxy &lt;[protocol://][user:password@]proxyhost[:port]&gt;
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use the specified proxy.</p><p>The proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix to specify alternative proxy protocols. Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request the specific SOCKS version to be used. No protocol specified, http:// and all others will be treated as HTTP proxies. (The protocol support was added in curl 7.21.7)</p><p>If the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is assumed to be 1080.</p><p>This option overrides existing environment variables that set the proxy to use. If there's an environment variable setting a proxy, you can set proxy to "" to override it.</p><p>All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy will transparently be converted to HTTP. It means that certain protocol specific operations might not be available. This is not the case if you can tunnel through the proxy, as one with the <em>-p, --proxytunnel</em> option.</p><p>User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special characters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.</p><p>The proxy host can be specified the exact same way as the proxy environment variables, including the protocol prefix (http://) and the embedded user + password.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    -X, --request &lt;command&gt;

  <dd>
    <p>(HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicating with the HTTP server.  The specified request will be used instead of the method otherwise used (which defaults to GET). Read the HTTP 1.1 specification for details and explanations. Common additional HTTP requests include PUT and DELETE, but related technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE and more.</p><p>Normally you don't need this option. All sorts of GET, HEAD, POST and PUT requests are rather invoked by using dedicated command line options.</p><p>This option only changes the actual word used in the HTTP request, it does not alter the way curl behaves. So for example if you want to make a proper HEAD request, using -X HEAD will not suffice. You need to use the <em>-I, --head</em> option.</p><p>(FTP) Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of LIST when doing file lists with FTP.</p><p>(POP3) Specifies a custom POP3 command to use instead of LIST or RETR. (Added in 7.26.0)</p><p>(IMAP) Specifies a custom IMAP command to use instead of LIST. (Added in 7.30.0)</p><p>(SMTP) Specifies a custom SMTP command to use instead of HELP or VRFY. (Added in 7.34.0)</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    --xattr
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When saving output to a file, this option tells curl to store certain file metadata in extended file attributes. Currently, the URL is stored in the xdg.origin.url attribute and, for HTTP, the content type is stored in the mime_type attribute. If the file system does not support extended attributes, a warning is issued.</p>

    -z, --time-cond &lt;date expression&gt;|&lt;file&gt;

    <p>(HTTP/FTP) Request a file that has been modified later than the given time and date, or one that has been modified before that time. The &lt;date expression&gt; can be all sorts of date strings or if it doesn't match any internal ones, it is taken as a filename and tries to get the modification date (mtime) from &lt;file&gt; instead. See the <a href="../man3/curl_getdate.3.html"><strong>curl_getdate</strong>(3)</a></em> man pages for date expression details.</p><p>Start the date expression with a dash (-) to make it request for a document that is older than the given date/time, default is a document that is newer than the specified date/time.</p><p>If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
