        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>Fd</strong> is a file & directory maintenance tool considered for the text terminals on general UNIX. It aims for a clone of the same named utility which is made for the PC/AT compatible machine and PC-9800 series. In fact, it is upper compatible functionally.</p><p><strong>Fd</strong> shows the browser screen listing files when you have invoked it. You can input some key which is bound each command, to execute various operations.</p><p>(In the following description, <strong>(UNIX)</strong> means that the operation is implemented only on UNIX version and not effective on MS-DOS version. As well as it, <strong>(DOS)</strong> means that the operation is implemented only on MS-DOS version.)</p><h3>Options</h3>
<p>The command line option is used for setting internal shell operations and setting the internal variables described below. You can use any variable name as the internal variable, but <strong>fd</strong> can accept only those which are described in the below section of <strong>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</strong>. If you specify <em>directory</em>, the current directory is moved to the directory initially. If you specify <em>directory2 .\|.\|.</em>, the split window mode is invoked, and the current directories of the supplemental windows are moved to the each directory.</p><p>The following options are available for the internal shell.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-c</strong><em> string</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Commands described by <em>string</em> are executed and exit immediately. It is effective only when it is invoked as <strong>fdsh</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-i</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the <strong>-i</strong> flag is present or if the standard input/output is a terminal, the shell is the interactive shell.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-s</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the <strong>-s</strong> flag is present or if no <em>args</em> is specified, commands for the shell are read from the standard input. Any remaining argument specifies the positional parameter.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-r</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The shell is a restricted shell. Specifically, the following operations are disallowed.</p><p>changing the current directory</p><p>setting the value of <strong>$PATH</strong>, <strong>$SHELL</strong> and <strong>$ENV</strong></p><p>specifying command names include <strong>/</strong></p><p>redirecting output (<strong>&gt;</strong> and <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong>)</p>

<p>In addition, the options described below in the description of <strong>set</strong> the builtin command are available.</p>
<h3>Screen Layout</h3>
<p><strong>Fd</strong> has the 3 major screen modes. In the browser screen, you can select from the file list and execute each command. In the archive browser screen, files in the archive file are listed separately by directory, and you can browse as well as the browser screen. In the tree screen, you can move on the directory tree and select the directory path.</p><p>In all screen modes, each <strong>3</strong> lines on the top/bottom of the screen are used for the various information of <strong>fd.</strong> The top information lines sometimes become <strong>4</strong> lines. The screen layout is the following.</p>

<h3>Internal Commands Description</h3>
<p>The detail of each internal command is the following. Internal commands with similar function are described together.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <strong>Move cursor</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Move a cursor.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Turn page</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Turn to the previous/next page, when files are not completely held in a screen. Also if you try to move out of the page with Cursor move, the page will be turned.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Move to the top/bottom</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Move a cursor to the top/bottom of the file list. When the list is not held in a screen, the page is turned.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Shift filename</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Shift the displayed string of filename on the cursor position, when the filename is longer than the prepared column width. It is displayed as shifted to right/left by 1 character. The display of the status line is also shifted simultaneously.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Change layout</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change the number of columns into each value. There are usually <strong>2</strong> columns per screen. As the column width per file is changed according to the number of columns, the displayed information is also changed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Mark file</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Mark the file on the cursor position. You cannot mark any directory. [<strong>Space</strong>] marks and moves down a cursor. [<strong>^Space</strong>] also marks and moves down a cursor, but doesn't turn the page. [<strong>Home</strong>] marks all the files, [<strong>End</strong>] marks all the files reversely. [<strong>\(**</strong>] additionally marks the file which matches the wildcard. You must input the wildcard string whenever you push [<strong>\(**</strong>].</p><p>Marked files are used as the target of <strong>ATTR_FILE</strong>, <strong>COPY_FILE</strong>, <strong>DELETE_FILE</strong>, <strong>MOVE_FILE</strong>, <strong>UNPACK_FILE</strong> and the user defined command macros.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Change directory</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>[<strong>Return</strong>] changes the current directory to the directory on the cursor position. If you want to change it to the parent directory, you should move a cursor to the file of ".\|." and push [<strong>Return</strong>], or simply push [<strong>Bs</strong>]. [<strong>&#92;</strong>] changes the current directory to the root directory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Push/pop file stack</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>[<strong>Del</strong>] pushes the file on the cursor position to the file stack, and temporarily deletes the file from the file list screen. You can push files to the file stack up to <strong>5</strong> files.</p><p>[<strong>Ins</strong>] pops the file from the file stack and insert it on the cursor position. The last pushed file is popped first. But this order is expediently displayed in <strong>fd</strong>, and it is reset by Directory move.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Redraw screen</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Redraw the file list screen by rereading the information of the current directory. It is useful when some other process add/delete files, or when something break the screen display.</p><p>Moreover, when you use the terminal which doesn't raise <strong>SIGWINCH</strong> signal at changing the screen size (like <strong>kterm</strong>(1) on HP-UX etc.), you must intentionally redraw after you change the screen size.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Change logical directory</strong> (Logdir)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change the current directory to the inputted pathname. When you input the pathname which starts with '/', it means not the relative move but the absolute move.</p><p>When you input the pathname "<strong>.</strong>", the pathname of the current directory is adjusted into absolute expression. Except this case, the current directory always is shown as the virtual pathname, by reason of a link and so on. When you input the pathname "<strong>?</strong>", you can move to the current directory when <strong>fd</strong> was invoked. When you input the pathname "<strong>-</strong>", you can move to the last visited directory.</p><p>Moreover, When you input the pathname "<strong>@</strong>" in floppy drive, you can move to the directory on UNIX file system, where you existed before moving to floppy drive. <strong>(UNIX)</strong></p><p>(Note: This command is called as "Loddsk" in the original FD on MS-DOS, which is short for "LOGical DiSK drive". This "logical" means the drive name prefixed to pathnames, and it is virtually named against "physical disk drive". On UNIX, since "logical disk drive" never means pathname nor directory, this command name "Change logical directory" is not suitable. But this name is expediently inherited from the original version.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Execute file</strong> (eXec)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Execute the file on the cursor position with some parameters, as the child process. The cursor position in command line exists after the filename in case of the executable file, and before the filename except it. You should fill suitable parameters or command name in each case. The up/down cursor keys can provide the command history which you executed before.</p><p>On MS-DOS version, the LFN form filename in the command line which is quoted with the quotation mark <strong>"</strong> is automatically replaced into 8+3 form filename before execution. In this case, when there is the filename described by the string quoted with <strong>"</strong>, this string is always replaced into 8+3 form filename after deleting <strong>"</strong>, otherwise it is never replaced including <strong>"</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Copy file</strong> (Copy)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Copy the file on the cursor position to the specified directory. When the cursor position indicates a directory, its contents are copied recursively. When some files are marked, the target is not the file on the cursor position but the marked files.</p><p>When the same named file exists in the destination, you can select the operation from the following: "Update (by timestamp)", "Rename (each copied file)", "Overwrite", "Not_copy_the_same_name", "Forward". If you select "Forward", you should specify the directory as the destination to forward. All files which have the same names are moved to the specified directory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Delete file</strong> (Delete)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Delete the file on the cursor position. No directory can be deleted. When some files are marked, the target is not the file on the cursor position but the marked files.</p><p>When you don't have write permission on the file, you are confirmed for security.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Rename file</strong> (Rename)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Rename the file on the cursor position. You cannot rename to the same name as any existent file. When you specify the pathname with some directory name, it is also moved to the directory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Sort file</strong> (Sort)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Sort files in the current directory. You can select the sorted type from the following: "fileName", "Extension", "Size", "Timestamp", "Length (of filename)", and specify "Up (incremental order)" or "Down (decremental order)". When the sorted type before sorting is the one except "No chg (not sort)", the choice will include "No chg". When you sort after sorting another sorted type, the previous sorted result is based in sorting. This sorting has a priority except specified type, the directory is always precedes any file, except for the case of "No chg". In case of "Length", files which have the same filename length are sorted in order of their names.</p><p>But this sorting is expediently displayed in <strong>fd</strong>, and it is reset by Directory move.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Find file</strong> (Find)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Find the files matching the wildcard, and display only them. The filename which starts with '.' doesn't match the wildcard which starts with '\(**' nor '?'. If you want to cancel the File find, you should move the current directory, or do <strong>FIND_FILE</strong> again and input a null line.</p><p>When the current directory has the files which have the extension registered to associate with an archive browser, the string which starts with '/' is used to find not the filename but the filename in archive files, and only the archive files which contain matched files are displayed. This function is available in the archive browser.</p><p>After Find file, you can not do <strong>WRITE_DIR</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Display tree screen</strong> (Tree)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Display the directory tree based on the current directory. You can select the directory in the tree screen, to move the current directory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Edit file</strong> (Editor)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Edit the file on the cursor position. The editor is used referring <strong>EDITOR</strong> the internal variable, or referring <strong>EDITOR</strong> the environment variable when the internal variable is undefined.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Unpack file</strong> (Unpack)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Unpack the archive file on the cursor position into the specified directory. In builtin configuration, you can unpack only the tar file and its compressed file and the LHa compressed file. You can describe configurations in the initial configuration file to support archivers except these.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Change attribute</strong> (Attr)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change the file access mode, the timestamp and the owner/group of the file on the cursor position. When some files are marked, the target is not the file on the cursor position but the marked files. In case of the marked files, you must select the mode, the timestamp or the owner/group, before changing it all together.</p><p>When you input the mode, cursor keys move a cursor to the position you want to change, [<strong>Space</strong>] reverses the attribute on the position. You should notice that the attribute of the execution bit is not a binary toggle but a triple toggle, which includes setuid bit, setgid bit and sticky bit respectively. If the target is the marked files, [<strong>m</strong>](Mask) will mask a bit on the cursor position with '<strong>*</strong>', to keep the value of the original file attribute. When you input the timestamp, you move a cursor to the position you want to change, and input a numeric value. When you input the owner/group, you move a cursor to the position for each name, and input a name or a ID value with [<strong>Space</strong>]. You can use the completion for a user name and a group name to input each name. Finally, [<strong>Return</strong>] executes the change. You can cancel with [<strong>Esc</strong>]. Be careful that the limit check of date is not perfect.</p><p>Moreover, [<strong>a</strong>](Attr), [<strong>d</strong>](Date), [<strong>t</strong>](Time), [<strong>o</strong>](Owner) and [<strong>g</strong>](Group) move a cursor to the each beginning of input line.</p><p>On the OS which has the attribute of file flags, you can change the file flags as well as the mode. In this case, [<strong>f</strong>](Flag) move a cursor to the beginning of input line of file flags. But the value of flags which you can change is based on your permission.</p>

  <dt>
    <strong>Move file</strong> (Move)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Move the file on the cursor position to the specified directory. When the cursor position indicates a directory, the directory itself is moved. When some files are marked, the target is not the file on the cursor position but the marked files.</p><p>When the same named file exists in the destination, you can select the operation as well as <strong>COPY_FILE</strong>.

  <dt>
    <strong>Execute child process</strong> (sHell)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Execute the inputted command string as the child process, by handling the internal shell. You can refer the command history and use automatic LFN replacement, as well as <strong>EXECUTE_FILE</strong>. When you push only [<strong>Return</strong>] without any input, the user shell which is described by <strong>SHELL</strong> the internal variable or the environment variable is invoked. In this case, you should input "<strong>exit</strong>" to return to <strong>fd</strong>. When the value of <strong>SHELL</strong> is <strong>fdsh</strong>, the internal shell is executed as the interactive shell.</p><p>However, when there is the same command name as a builtin command or a internal command, the builtin command or the internal command are executed instead of the external command. You can refer the clause of `<strong>Builtin Commands</strong>' for the details of the builtin command.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Write directory</strong> (Write)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Write the displayed directory. The gap between files on the directory entry is filled. When it is executed after arranged by <strong>PUSH_FILE</strong>, <strong>POP_FILE</strong> and <strong>SORT_DIR</strong>, the result is written.</p><p>When the displayed directory doesn't belong to the hierarchy under your home directory, you are confirmed for security whether if any other user doesn't use the directory. Since it is insecure, you cannot write the NFS mounted directory and some special directories.</p><p>If you execute the internal command which arranges the file order, and then try to execute the internal command which will break that order, you will be confirmed whether if you write the directory or not, just before the internal command is executed. For this function, you can write the directory without intentionally executing this Directory write command. But when the displayed directory is not under your home directory, this confirmation is not done.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>Backup tape</strong> (Backup)
  </dt>
  <dd>

When some files are marked, the target is not the file on the cursor position but the marked files.</p><p>According to the extension of the inputted archive file, the associated archiver is automatically selected. In builtin configuration, you can pack only the tar file and its compressed file and the LHa compressed file. You can describe configurations in the initial configuration file to support archivers except these.</p><p>When you use <strong>tar</strong>(1), you may sometimes be unable to pack a lot of files at once, because of the maximum parameter length which can be given at once. In those case, you can create the archive file with <strong>BACKUP_TAPE</strong>.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Change attributes the directory on the cursor position revursively. As well as changing attributes of the marked files, you must select the mode, the timestamp or the owner/group, before changing it all together with each file under the directory.</p><p>When you input the mode, you should notice that the attribute of the execution bit is not a triple toggle but a 5-states toggle, which includes '<strong>X</strong>' and '<strong>!</strong>'. '<strong>X</strong>' means setting the bit only if the object is a directory or some execution bits are set. '<strong>!</strong>' also means unsetting the bit only if the object is a directory or some execution bits are set. [<strong>m</strong>](Mask) will mask a bit on the cursor position with '<strong>*</strong>', to keep the value of the original file attribute.</p>

<h3>Commands</h3>
<p>In <strong>EXECUTE_SH</strong> and the initial configuration file, you can use the internal commands described above and the builtin commands described below, as well as the external commands. With these commands, a pipeline can consist of one or more commands separated by <strong>\(bv</strong> or <strong>\(bv\|&</strong>. <strong>\(bv</strong> connects the standard output of the previous command to the standard input of the next command. <strong>\(bv\|&</strong> connects both the standard output and the standard error output of the previous command to the standard input of the next command. The exit status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command. You can start a pipeline with <strong>!</strong>, then the exit status of a pipeline will be the logical NOT of the exit status of the last command. Moreover, a command list can consist of one or more pipelines separated by <strong>;</strong>, <strong>&</strong>, <strong>&\|\(bv</strong>, <strong>&&</strong>, <strong>\(bv\|\(bv</strong>. This command list can end with <strong>;</strong>, <strong>&</strong> or <strong>&\|\(bv</strong>. These separators mean the following.</p>

<h3>Tree Screen</h3>
<p>Since representing the whole file system in tree structure takes too many time, only the directories which are direct ancestors and the direct sub directories are displayed, first in the tree screen. In the directories which are direct ancestors, the other sub directories (if exists) are grouped as "<strong>.\|.\|.</strong>". These grouped sub directories will be expanded automatically when a cursor is placed on its position.</p><p>The sub directories which are not expanded yet are represented with '<strong>&gt;</strong>' trailing the filename, which shows as they are. Such directory is never expanded until it is required to expand explicitly, then you should expand it by the following key inputs before moving to any hidden sub directory.</p><p>In the tree screen, the following key inputs are available.</p>

<p>When directories are recursively expanded, the machine operation is so late that it maybe seems to freeze. In this case, you can input any key while operating. If key input is recognized while expanding directories, expanding has been stopped at that moment in spite of not finishing. Even if key repeat keeps effective, any operation will be delayed for this function.</p>
<h3>Archive Browser</h3>
<p>When the launcher is invoked on the position of the file whose extension is registered to associate with an archive browser, the archive browser screen has come. In this screen, you can browse files in the archive file as well as in the normal directory. But you cannot use the following internal commands in this screen.</p>
<pre>
LOG_TOP	ATTR_FILE	COPY_FILE	MOVE_FILE
DELETE_FILE	DELETE_DIR	RENAME_FILE	MAKE_DIR
WRITE_DIR	TREE_DIR	EDIT_FILE	LOG_TREE
COPY_TREE	MOVE_TREE	FIND_DIR	ATTR_DIR
SYMLINK_MODE	DOTFILE_MODE	FILEFLG_MODE	SPLIT_WINDOW
KILL_WINDOW
</pre>
<p>When you want to register a new archive browser, you must describe the format listed by the archiver as the following representation. One format string represents the format for 1 file in the list.</p>
<pre>
<strong>%a</strong>	Field which indicates a file mode
<strong>%u</strong>	Field which indicates UID of a file
<strong>%g</strong>	Field which indicates GID of a file
<strong>%s</strong>	Field which indicates a file size
<strong>%y</strong>	Field which indicates a file creation year
<strong>%m</strong>	Field which indicates a file creation month
	(No concerning if numeric or alphabetical)
<strong>%d</strong>	Field which indicates a file creation day
<strong>%w</strong>	Field which indicates a file creation week (ignored)
<strong>%t</strong>	Field which indicates a file creation time
	("HH:MM:SS" form, MM and SS can be lacking)
<strong>%p</strong>	Field which indicates a file creation am/pm
<strong>%B</strong>	Field which indicates a major device ID
<strong>%b</strong>	Field which indicates a minor device ID
<strong>%/</strong><em>str</em><strong>/</strong>	Field which indicates a type is directory
	when this field string is <em>str</em>
	(case insensitive)
<strong>%!</strong><em>str</em><strong>!</strong>	0 or more continuous fields
	which consists of the string <em>str</em>
	(case insensitive)
<strong>%f</strong>	Field which indicates a filename
<strong>%x</strong>	Field which is needless (ignored)
<strong>%%</strong>	% itself
<strong>&#92;n</strong>	Newline
<strong>Space Tab</strong> 0 or more characters of spaces or tabs
</pre>
<p>In this description, the field means the area separated by spaces, tabs or newlines. When the string which indicates each information is separated by these characters, you can simply describe the above string which indicates that field. When the string is separated by another character, you should describe the above string with that separator. You can describe to indicate the field length as numeric, such as <em>%10a</em>. This example means that the field which indicates a file mode consists of 10 characters. If you describe it with a character <strong>*</strong> as the field length instead of numeric, such as <em>%*f</em>, the string to the end of line is regarded as a field, in which any space and tab will be ignored.</p><p>When a field may have the different meanings according to situation, you should describe it quoted with <strong>{ }</strong>, such as <em>%{yt}</em>. This example means that this field indicates a creation year or a creation time. When the information for 1 file consists of multiple lines, you should place a <strong>&#92;n</strong> on the position of newline in the format string.</p><p>For example, the following are the format strings for the list of some archivers. While some spaces are used here for easiness to see, these spaces are not always necessary because any space between fields is ignored.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    `<strong>lha l</strong>'
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>"%9a %u/%g %s %x %m %d %{yt} %f"</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    `<strong>lha v</strong>' (MS-DOS)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>"%f&#92;n%s %x %x %y-%m-%d %t"</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    `<strong>tar tvf</strong>' (BSD)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>"%9a %u/%g %s %m %d %t %y %f"</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    `<strong>tar tvf</strong>' (SVR4)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>"%a %u/%g %s %m %d %t %y %f"</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>If you register archive browsers with above format, in the builtin command of <strong>EXECUTE_SH</strong> or in the initial configuration file, you can use the archive browser which is not prepared by default. But, if you want to execute or view files in the archive file, you must register the archiver command for the archive file, too, don't forget this.</p><p>On some OS, <strong>tar</strong>(1) may output the Japanese timestamp when <em>japanese</em> is substituted for <strong>LANG</strong> the environment variable. Since <strong>fd</strong> cannot analyze the representation like this, you should describe <em>`export LANG=C'</em> in the initial configuration file, or specify <strong>LANG</strong> in the description of listing command, such as <em>`LANG=C tar tvf'</em>.</p>
<h3>Floppy Drive (UNIX)</h3>
<p>You can access the MS-DOS formatted floppy disk, by representing to prefix "<em>c</em><strong>:</strong>" to the directory name. But, it is necessary to register the floppy drive and set <strong>DOSDRIVE</strong> the internal variable which makes this function effective, in advance.</p><p>Each registered drive is distinguished with the drive name. You should tag the physically different drive as the different drive name. When the same physical drive supports multiple formats, you can register each format with the same drive name, or the different drive name each other. If you tag the same drive name, the justice of the format is tried in registered order, so that you should register the format which you often use in the first place.</p><p>Each drive of the floppy drive has the its own current directory. The default value of this is a root directory, and the current directory is moved back to a root directory again whenever you change a floppy disk. When you describe the directory name as starting with '/' after '<strong>:</strong>', it means the absolute path representation of that drive. If this '/' is not exist, it means the relative path representation from the current directory of that drive, don't forget this.</p><p>Regrettably, some internal commands like as <strong>WRITE_DIR</strong>, <strong>INFO_FILESYS</strong> cannot support the floppy drive. Some filenames are renamed when they are copied from UNIX for reason of the filename length limit.</p><p>When you use a lowercase letter as the drive name, you can access it as the floppy drive which can treat the Long File Name (LFN) for MS-Windows formatted floppy disk. In this case, you can copy a file with a long filename on UNIX as it is. But, when the UNICODE translation table <strong>fd-unicd.tbl</strong> does not exist in the same directory as the invoked <strong>fd</strong> exists, any Kanji filename cannot be treated as LFN representation. Reversely, when you use a uppercase letter as the drive name, LFN is ignored and 8+3 formed filename is treated. MS-DOS version inherits this specification by the case of a drive name.</p>
<h3>URL Drive (UNIX)</h3>
<p>You can access remote services on the network, by representing the URL string as the directory name. The URL format is <em>scheme</em><strong>://</strong>[<em>user</em>[<strong>:</strong><em>password</em>]<strong>@</strong>]<em>host</em>[<strong>:</strong><em>port</em>]<strong>/</strong><em>directory</em><strong>/</strong>. You can specify <strong>ftp</strong> or <strong>http</strong> as <em>scheme</em>. You can specify the name or IP address of the remote host as <em>host</em>. You can specify the TCP port number as <em>port</em>. If <em>port</em> is omitted, the default port number is used. The default port number for <strong>ftp</strong> is <strong>21</strong>, and the default port number for <strong>http</strong> is <strong>80</strong>. You can specify account information to connect the remote host as <em>user</em> and <em>password</em>. If <em>user</em> is omitted, the anonymous FTP connection will be used with <strong>ftp</strong>, or you will be queried as needed with <strong>http</strong>. If <em>password</em> is omitted, you will be queried as needed. But, it is necessary to set <strong>URLDRIVE</strong> the internal variable which makes this function effective, in advance.</p><p>Regrettably, some internal commands cannot support the URL drive, for the sake of restrictions of the FTP and HTTP protocols or settings of the host side.</p>
<h3>String Input</h3>
<p>When you input the string, such as the pathname, the following key inputs are available. The kind of referred history differs with the input string required. In the split window mode, the current directory of another window is always placed on the top of the pathname history.</p>

<h3>Edit Mode</h3>
<p>When you want to use some functions bound to special keys, such as a cursor key or a scroll key, such a key doesn't exist in some terminals. In such a case, substituting the string for <strong>EDITMODE</strong> the internal variable can make you use some control keys as alternative to these special keys. Since this alternative key function is prior to the key binding by the builtin command, the key binding is invalid for the control characters used as the alternative keys. The prepared edit modes are the following 3 modes.</p>

<h3>Kana-Kanji IME (UNIX)</h3>
<p>You can input strings in the Kana-Kanji IME mode, if you input the key specified by <strong>IMEKEY</strong> or select "Kanji" from the pseudo terminal menu.</p><p>The translation performance will depend on the Kana-Kanji translation dictionary <strong>fd-dict.tbl</strong>. When it does not exist in the same directory as the invoked <strong>fd</strong> exists, translation to Kanji will not be available. The standard installed dictionary file is the Tan-Kanji dictionary, which can support only the Tan-Kanji translation. The dictionaly such as the pubdic, which includes the Hinsi information, will bring you the Tan-Bunsetsu translation. The Ren-Bunsetsu translation is not be supported.</p><p>In the Kana-Kanji IME mode, the following key inputs are available.</p>

<h3>Parameter Macros</h3>
<p>You can use the following parameter macros in the string which is used for the registration of command macros and for executing command. But, you cannot use them in the functions, the input file for <strong>source</strong> command, and the initial configuration file, then you should use <strong>evalmacro</strong> command when you want to use any parameter macro in them.</p>

In that case, you can probably avoid it by quoting the string to be converted with <strong>%'</strong>.</p>
