      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">THE ZSH/ATTR MODULE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <strong>zsh/attr</strong> module is used for manipulating extended attributes. The <strong>-h</strong> option causes all commands to operate on symbolic links instead of their targets. The builtins in this module are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>zgetattr</strong> [ <strong>-h</strong> ] <em>filename</em> <em>attribute</em> [ <em>parameter</em> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Get the extended attribute <em>attribute</em> from the specified <em>filename</em>. If the optional argument <em>parameter</em> is given, the attribute is set on that parameter instead of being printed to stdout.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>zsetattr</strong> [ <strong>-h</strong> ] <em>filename</em> <em>attribute</em> <em>value</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the extended attribute <em>attribute</em> on the specified <em>filename</em> to <em>value</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>zdelattr</strong> [ <strong>-h</strong> ] <em>filename</em> <em>attribute</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Remove the extended attribute <em>attribute</em> from the specified <em>filename</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>zlistattr</strong> [ <strong>-h</strong> ] <em>filename</em> [ <em>parameter</em> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>List the extended attributes currently set on the specified <em>filename</em>. If the optional argument <em>parameter</em> is given, the list of attributes is set on that parameter instead of being printed to stdout.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p><strong>zgetattr</strong> and <strong>zlistattr</strong> allocate memory dynamically.  If the attribute or list of attributes grows between the allocation and the call to get them, they return 2.  On all other errors, 1 is returned.  This allows the calling function to check for this case and retry.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">THE ZSH/CAP MODULE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <strong>zsh/cap</strong> module is used for manipulating POSIX.1e (POSIX.6) capability sets.  If the operating system does not support this interface, the builtins defined by this module will do nothing. The builtins in this module are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>cap</strong> [ <em>capabilities</em> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change the shell's process capability sets to the specified <em>capabilities</em>, otherwise display the shell's current capabilities.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>getcap</strong> <em>filename</em> ...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a built-in implementation of the POSIX standard utility.  It displays the capability sets on each specified <em>filename</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>setcap</strong> <em>capabilities</em> <em>filename</em> ...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a built-in implementation of the POSIX standard utility.  It sets the capability sets on each specified <em>filename</em> to the specified <em>capabilities</em>.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">THE ZSH/CLONE MODULE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <strong>zsh/clone</strong> module makes available one builtin command:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>clone</strong> <em>tty</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Creates a forked instance of the current shell, attached to the specified <em>tty</em>.  In the new shell, the <strong>PID</strong>, <strong>PPID</strong> and <strong>TTY</strong> special parameters are changed appropriately.  <strong>$!</strong> is set to zero in the new shell, and to the new shell's PID in the original shell.</p><p>The return status of the builtin is zero in both shells if successful, and non-zero on error.</p><p>The target of <strong>clone</strong> should be an unused terminal, such as an unused virtual console or a virtual terminal created by</p><p>xterm -e sh -c 'trap : INT QUIT TSTP; tty; while :; do sleep 100000000; done'</p><p>Some words of explanation are warranted about this long xterm command line: when doing clone on a pseudo-terminal, some other session ("session" meant as a unix session group, or SID) is already owning the terminal. Hence the cloned zsh cannot acquire the pseudo-terminal as a controlling tty. That means two things:</p><p>the job control signals will go to the sh-started-by-xterm process</p>
<pre>
      group (that's why we disable INT QUIT and TSTP with trap; otherwise
      the while loop could get suspended or killed)
</pre>
<p>the cloned shell will have job control disabled, and the job</p>
<pre>
      control keys (control-C, control-&#92; and control-Z) will not work.
</pre>
<p>This does not apply when cloning to an <strong>unused</strong> vc.</p><p>Cloning to a used (and unprepared) terminal will result in two processes reading simultaneously from the same terminal, with input bytes going randomly to either process.</p><p><strong>clone</strong> is mostly useful as a shell built-in replacement for openvt.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <strong>zsh/compctl</strong> module makes available two builtin commands. <strong>compctl</strong>, is the old, deprecated way to control completions for ZLE.  See <a href="../man1/zshcompctl.1.html"><strong>zshcompctl</strong>(1)</a>. The other builtin command, <strong>compcall</strong> can be used in user-defined completion widgets, see <a href="../man1/zshcompwid.1.html"><strong>zshcompwid</strong>(1)</a>.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">THE ZSH/COMPLIST MODULE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <strong>zsh/complist</strong> module offers three extensions to completion listings: the ability to highlight matches in such a list, the ability to scroll through long lists and a different style of menu completion.</p><h3>Colored completion listings</h3>
<p>Whenever one of the parameters <strong>ZLS_COLORS</strong> or <strong>ZLS_COLOURS</strong> is set and the <strong>zsh/complist</strong> module is loaded or linked into the shell, completion lists will be colored.  Note, however, that <strong>complist</strong> will not automatically be loaded if it is not linked in:  on systems with dynamic loading, `<strong>zmodload zsh/complist</strong>' is required.</p><p>The parameters <strong>ZLS_COLORS</strong> and <strong>ZLS_COLOURS</strong> describe how matches are highlighted.  To turn on highlighting an empty value suffices, in which case all the default values given below will be used.  The format of the value of these parameters is the same as used by the GNU version of the <strong>ls</strong> command: a colon-separated list of specifications of the form `<em>name</em>=<em>value</em>'.  The <em>name</em> may be one of the following strings, most of which specify file types for which the <em>value</em> will be used. The strings and their default values are:</p>

The <em>value</em> given for this pattern will be used for all matches (not just filenames) whose display string are matched by the pattern.  Definitions for the form with the leading equal sign take precedence over the values defined for file types, which in turn take precedence over the form with the leading asterisk (file extensions).</p><p>The leading-equals form also allows different parts of the displayed strings to be colored differently.  For this, the pattern has to use the `<strong>(#b)</strong>' globbing flag and pairs of parentheses surrounding the parts of the strings that are to be colored differently.  In this case the <em>value</em> may consist of more than one color code separated by equal signs.  The first code will be used for all parts for which no explicit code is specified and the following codes will be used for the parts matched by the sub-patterns in parentheses.  For example, the specification `<strong>=(#b)(?)*(?)=0=3=7</strong>' will be used for all matches which are at least two characters long and will use the code `<strong>3</strong>' for the first character, `<strong>7</strong>' for the last character and `<strong>0</strong>' for the rest.</p><p>All three forms of <em>name</em> may be preceded by a pattern in parentheses.  If this is given, the <em>value</em> will be used only for matches in groups whose names are matched by the pattern given in the parentheses.  For example, `<strong>(g*)m*=43</strong>' highlights all matches beginning with `<strong>m</strong>' in groups whose names  begin with `<strong>g</strong>' using the color code `<strong>43</strong>'.  In case of the `<strong>lc</strong>', `<strong>rc</strong>', and `<strong>ec</strong>' codes, the group pattern is ignored.</p><p>Note also that all patterns are tried in the order in which they appear in the parameter value until the first one matches which is then used.</p><p>When printing a match, the code prints the value of <strong>lc</strong>, the value for the file-type or the last matching specification with a `<strong>*</strong>', the value of <strong>rc</strong>, the string to display for the match itself, and then the value of <strong>ec</strong> if that is defined or the values of <strong>lc</strong>, <strong>no</strong>, and <strong>rc</strong> if <strong>ec</strong> is not defined.</p><p>The default values are ISO 6429 (ANSI) compliant and can be used on vt100 compatible terminals such as <strong>xterm</strong>s.  On monochrome terminals the default values will have no visible effect.  The <strong>colors</strong> function from the contribution can be used to get associative arrays containing the codes for ANSI terminals (see the section `Other Functions' in <a href="../man1/zshcontrib.1.html"><strong>zshcontrib</strong>(1)</a>).  For example, after loading <strong>colors</strong>, one could use `<strong>$colors[red]</strong>' to get the code for foreground color red and `<strong>$colors[bg-green]</strong>' for the code for background color green.</p><p>If the completion system invoked by compinit is used, these parameters should not be set directly because the system controls them itself.  Instead, the <strong>list-colors</strong> style should be used (see the section `Completion System Configuration' in <a href="../man1/zshcompsys.1.html"><strong>zshcompsys</strong>(1)</a>).</p>
<h3>Scrolling in completion listings</h3>
<p>To enable scrolling through a completion list, the <strong>LISTPROMPT</strong> parameter must be set.  Its value will be used as the prompt; if it is the empty string, a default prompt will be used.  The value may contain escapes of the form `<strong>%x</strong>'.  It supports the escapes `<strong>%B</strong>', `<strong>%b</strong>', `<strong>%S</strong>', `<strong>%s</strong>', `<strong>%U</strong>', `<strong>%u</strong>', `<strong>%F</strong>', `<strong>%f</strong>', `<strong>%K</strong>', `<strong>%k</strong>' and `<strong>%{...%}</strong>' used also in shell prompts as well as three pairs of additional sequences: a `<strong>%l</strong>' or `<strong>%L</strong>' is replaced by the number of the last line shown and the total number of lines in the form `<em>number</em><strong>/</strong><em>total</em>'; a `<strong>%m</strong>' or `<strong>%M</strong>' is replaced with the number of the last match shown and the total number of matches; and `<strong>%p</strong>' or `<strong>%P</strong>' is replaced with `<strong>Top</strong>', `<strong>Bottom</strong>' or the position of the first line shown in percent of the total number of lines, respectively.  In each of these cases the form with the uppercase letter will be replaced with a string of fixed width, padded to the right with spaces, while the lowercase form will not be padded.</p><p>If the parameter <strong>LISTPROMPT</strong> is set, the completion code will not ask if the list should be shown.  Instead it immediately starts displaying the list, stopping after the first screenful, showing the prompt at the bottom, waiting for a keypress after temporarily switching to the <strong>listscroll</strong> keymap.  Some of the zle functions have a special meaning while scrolling lists:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>send-break</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>stops listing discarding the key pressed</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>accept-line</strong>, <strong>down-history</strong>, <strong>down-line-or-history</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>down-line-or-search</strong>, <strong>vi-down-line-or-history</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>scrolls forward one line</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>complete-word</strong>, <strong>menu-complete</strong>, <strong>expand-or-complete</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>expand-or-complete-prefix</strong>, <strong>menu-complete-or-expand</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>scrolls forward one screenful</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>accept-search</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>stop listing but take no other action</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Every other character stops listing and immediately processes the key as usual.  Any key that is not bound in the <strong>listscroll</strong> keymap or that is bound to <strong>undefined-key</strong> is looked up in the keymap currently selected.</p><p>As for the <strong>ZLS_COLORS</strong> and <strong>ZLS_COLOURS</strong> parameters, <strong>LISTPROMPT</strong> should not be set directly when using the shell function based completion system.  Instead, the <strong>list-prompt</strong> style should be used.</p>
<h3>Menu selection</h3>
<p>The <strong>zsh/complist</strong> module also offers an alternative style of selecting matches from a list, called menu selection, which can be used if the shell is set up to return to the last prompt after showing a completion list (see the <strong>ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT</strong> option in <a href="../man1/zshoptions.1.html"><strong>zshoptions</strong>(1)</a>).</p><p>Menu selection can be invoked directly by the widget <strong>menu-select</strong> defined by this module.  This is a standard ZLE widget that can be bound to a key in the usual way as described in <a href="../man1/zshzle.1.html"><strong>zshzle</strong>(1)</a>.</p><p>Alternatively, the parameter <strong>MENUSELECT</strong> can be set to an integer, which gives the minimum number of matches that must be present before menu selection is automatically turned on.  This second method requires that menu completion be started, either directly from a widget such as <strong>menu-complete</strong>, or due to one of the options <strong>MENU_COMPLETE</strong> or <strong>AUTO_MENU</strong> being set.  If <strong>MENUSELECT</strong> is set, but is 0, 1 or empty, menu selection will always be started during an ambiguous menu completion.</p><p>When using the completion system based on shell functions, the <strong>MENUSELECT</strong> parameter should not be used (like the <strong>ZLS_COLORS</strong> and <strong>ZLS_COLOURS</strong> parameters described above).  Instead, the <strong>menu</strong> style should be used with the <strong>select=</strong><em>...</em> keyword.</p><p>After menu selection is started, the matches will be listed. If there are more matches than fit on the screen, only the first screenful is shown.  The matches to insert into the command line can be selected from this list.  In the list one match is highlighted using the value for <strong>ma</strong> from the <strong>ZLS_COLORS</strong> or <strong>ZLS_COLOURS</strong> parameter.  The default value for this is `<strong>7</strong>' which forces the selected match to be highlighted using standout mode on a vt100-compatible terminal.  If neither <strong>ZLS_COLORS</strong> nor <strong>ZLS_COLOURS</strong> is set, the same terminal control sequence as for the `<strong>%S</strong>' escape in prompts is used.</p><p>If there are more matches than fit on the screen and the parameter <strong>MENUPROMPT</strong> is set, its value will be shown below the matches.  It supports the same escape sequences as <strong>LISTPROMPT</strong>, but the number of the match or line shown will be that of the one where the mark is placed.  If its value is the empty string, a default prompt will be used.</p><p>The <strong>MENUSCROLL</strong> parameter can be used to specify how the list is scrolled.  If the parameter is unset, this is done line by line, if it is set to `<strong>0</strong>' (zero), the list will scroll half the number of lines of the screen.  If the value is positive, it gives the number of lines to scroll and if it is negative, the list will be scrolled the number of lines of the screen minus the (absolute) value.</p><p>As for the <strong>ZLS_COLORS</strong>, <strong>ZLS_COLOURS</strong> and <strong>LISTPROMPT</strong> parameters, neither <strong>MENUPROMPT</strong> nor <strong>MENUSCROLL</strong> should be set directly when using the shell function based completion system.  Instead, the <strong>select-prompt</strong> and <strong>select-scroll</strong> styles should be used.</p><p>The completion code sometimes decides not to show all of the matches in the list.  These hidden matches are either matches for which the completion function which added them explicitly requested that they not appear in the list (using the <strong>-n</strong> option of the <strong>compadd</strong> builtin command) or they are matches which duplicate a string already in the list (because they differ only in things like prefixes or suffixes that are not displayed).  In the list used for menu selection, however, even these matches are shown so that it is possible to select them.  To highlight such matches the <strong>hi</strong> and <strong>du</strong> capabilities in the <strong>ZLS_COLORS</strong> and <strong>ZLS_COLOURS</strong> parameters are supported for hidden matches of the first and second kind, respectively.</p><p>Selecting matches is done by moving the mark around using the zle movement functions.  When not all matches can be shown on the screen at the same time, the list will scroll up and down when crossing the top or bottom line.  The following zle functions have special meaning during menu selection.  Note that the following always perform the same task within the menu selection map and cannot be replaced by user defined widgets, nor can the set of functions be extended:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>accept-line</strong>, <strong>accept-search</strong></p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>send-break</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>

  </dt>
  <dd>

</dl>
<p>All movement functions wrap around at the edges; any other zle function not listed leaves menu selection and executes that function.  It is possible to make widgets in the above list do the same by using the form of the widget with a `<strong>.</strong>' in front.  For example, the widget `<strong>.accept-line</strong>' has the effect of leaving menu selection and accepting the entire command line.</p><p>During this selection the widget uses the keymap <strong>menuselect</strong>.  Any key that is not defined in this keymap or that is bound to <strong>undefined-key</strong> is looked up in the keymap currently selected.  This is used to ensure that the most important keys used during selection (namely the cursor keys, return, and TAB) have sensible defaults.  However, keys in the <strong>menuselect</strong> keymap can be modified directly using the <strong>bindkey</strong> builtin command (see <a href="../man1/zshmodules.1.html"><strong>zshmodules</strong>(1)</a>). For example, to make the return key leave menu selection without accepting the match currently selected one could call</p>
<pre>
<strong>bindkey -M menuselect '^M' send-break</strong>
</pre>
<p>after loading the <strong>zsh/complist</strong> module.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">THE ZSH/COMPUTIL MODULE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <strong>zsh/computil</strong> module adds several builtin commands that are used by some of the completion functions in the completion system based on shell functions (see <a href="../man1/zshcompsys.1.html"><strong>zshcompsys</strong>(1)</a> ).  Except for <strong>compquote</strong> these builtin commands are very specialised and thus not very interesting when writing your own completion functions.  In summary, these builtin commands are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>comparguments</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is used by the <strong>_arguments</strong> function to do the argument and command line parsing.  Like <strong>compdescribe</strong> it has an option <strong>-i</strong> to do the parsing and initialize some internal state and various options to access the state information to decide what should be completed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>compdescribe</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is used by the <strong>_describe</strong> function to build the displays for the matches and to get the strings to add as matches with their options.  On the first call one of the options <strong>-i</strong> or <strong>-I</strong> should be supplied as the first argument.  In the first case, display strings without the descriptions will be generated, in the second case, the string used to separate the matches from their descriptions must be given as the second argument and the descriptions (if any) will be shown.  All other arguments are like the definition arguments to <strong>_describe</strong> itself.</p><p>Once <strong>compdescribe</strong> has been called with either the <strong>-i</strong> or the <strong>-I</strong> option, it can be repeatedly called with the <strong>-g</strong> option and the names of four parameters as its arguments.  This will step through the different sets of matches and store the value of <strong>compstate[list]</strong> in the first scalar, the options for <strong>compadd</strong> in the second array, the matches in the third array, and the strings to be displayed in the completion listing in the fourth array.  The arrays may then be directly given to <strong>compadd</strong> to register the matches with the completion code.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>compfiles</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Used by the <strong>_path_files</strong> function to optimize complex recursive filename generation (globbing).  It does three things.  With the <strong>-p</strong> and <strong>-P</strong> options it builds the glob patterns to use, including the paths already handled and trying to optimize the patterns with respect to the prefix and suffix from the line and the match specification currently used.  The <strong>-i</strong> option does the directory tests for the <strong>ignore-parents</strong> style and the <strong>-r</strong> option tests if a component for some of the matches are equal to the string on the line and removes all other matches if that is true.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>compgroups</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Used by the <strong>_tags</strong> function to implement the internals of the <strong>group-order</strong> style.  This only takes its arguments as names of completion groups and creates the groups for it (all six types: sorted and unsorted, both without removing duplicates, with removing all duplicates and with removing consecutive duplicates).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>compquote</strong> [ <strong>-p</strong> ] <em>names</em> ...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There may be reasons to write completion functions that have to add the matches using the <strong>-Q</strong> option to <strong>compadd</strong> and perform quoting themselves.  Instead of interpreting the first character of the <strong>all_quotes</strong> key of the <strong>compstate</strong> special association and using the <strong>q</strong> flag for parameter expansions, one can use this builtin command.  The arguments are the names of scalar or array parameters and the values of these parameters are quoted as needed for the innermost quoting level.  If the <strong>-p</strong> option is given, quoting is done as if there is some prefix before the values of the parameters, so that a leading equal sign will not be quoted.</p><p>The return status is non-zero in case of an error and zero otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>comptags</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>comptry</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>These implement the internals of the tags mechanism.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>compvalues</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Like <strong>comparguments</strong>, but for the <strong>_values</strong> function.</p>

Note that the coordinates of subwindows are relative to the screen, not the parent, as with other windows.</p><p>Use the subcommand <strong>delwin</strong> to delete a window created with <strong>addwin</strong>.  Note that <strong>end</strong> does <em>not</em> implicitly delete windows, and that <strong>delwin</strong> does not erase the screen image of the window.</p><p>The window corresponding to the full visible screen is called <strong>stdscr</strong>; it always exists after `<strong>zcurses init</strong>' and cannot be delete with <strong>delwin</strong>.</p><p>The subcommand <strong>refresh</strong> will refresh window <em>targetwin</em>; this is necessary to make any pending changes (such as characters you have prepared for output with <strong>char</strong>) visible on the screen.  <strong>refresh</strong> without an argument causes the screen to be cleared and redrawn. If multiple windows are given, the screen is updated once at the end.</p><p>The subcommand <strong>touch</strong> marks the <em>targetwin</em>s listed as changed. This is necessary before <strong>refresh</strong>ing windows if a window that was in front of another window (which may be <strong>stdscr</strong>) is deleted.</p><p>The subcommand <strong>move</strong> moves the cursor position in <em>targetwin</em> to new coordinates <em>new_y</em> and <em>new_x</em>.  Note that the subcommand <strong>string</strong> (but not the subcommand <strong>char</strong>) advances the cursor position over the characters added.</p><p>The subcommand <strong>clear</strong> erases the contents of <em>targetwin</em>.  One (and no more than one) of three options may be specified.  With the option <strong>redraw</strong>, in addition the next <strong>refresh</strong> of <em>targetwin</em> will cause the screen to be cleared and repainted.  With the option <strong>eol</strong>, <em>targetwin</em> is only cleared to the end of the current cursor line.  With the option <strong>bot</strong>, <em>targetwin</em> is cleared to the end of the window, i.e everything to the right and below the cursor is cleared.</p><p>The subcommand <strong>position</strong> writes various positions associated with <em>targetwin</em> into the array named <em>array</em>. These are, in order:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>-</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The y and x coordinates of the cursor relative to the top left of <em>targetwin</em></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The y and x coordinates of the top left of <em>targetwin</em> on the screen</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The size of <em>targetwin</em> in y and x dimensions.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Outputting characters and strings are achieved by <strong>char</strong> and <strong>string</strong> respectively.</p><p>To draw a border around window <em>targetwin</em>, use <strong>border</strong>.  Note that the border is not subsequently handled specially:  in other words, the border is simply a set of characters output at the edge of the window.  Hence it can be overwritten, can scroll off the window, etc.</p><p>The subcommand <strong>attr</strong> will set <em>targetwin</em>'s attributes or foreground/background color pair for any successive character output. Each <em>attribute</em> given on the line may be prepended by a <strong>+</strong> to set or a <strong>-</strong> to unset that attribute; <strong>+</strong> is assumed if absent.  The attributes supported are <strong>blink</strong>, <strong>bold</strong>, <strong>dim</strong>, <strong>reverse</strong>, <strong>standout</strong>, and <strong>underline</strong>.</p><p>Each <em>fg_col</em><strong>/</strong><em>bg_col</em> attribute (to be read as `<em>fg_col</em> on <em>bg_col</em>') sets the foreground and background color for character output.  The color <strong>default</strong> is sometimes available (in particular if the library is ncurses), specifying the foreground or background color with which the terminal started.  The color pair <strong>default/default</strong> is always available.</p><p><strong>bg</strong> overrides the color and other attributes of all characters in the window.  Its usual use is to set the background initially, but it will overwrite the attributes of any characters at the time when it is called. In addition to the arguments allowed with <strong>attr</strong>, an argument <strong>@</strong><em>char</em> specifies a character to be shown in otherwise blank areas of the window. Owing to limitations of curses this cannot be a multibyte character (use of ASCII characters only is recommended).  As the specified set of attributes override the existing background, turning attributes off in the arguments is not useful, though this does not cause an error.</p><p>The subcommand <strong>scroll</strong> can be used with <strong>on</strong> or <strong>off</strong> to enabled or disable scrolling of a window when the cursor would otherwise move below the window due to typing or output.  It can also be used with a positive or negative integer to scroll the window up or down the given number of lines without changing the current cursor position (which therefore appears to move in the opposite direction relative to the window).  In the second case, if scrolling is <strong>off</strong> it is temporarily turned <strong>on</strong> to allow the window to be scrolled.</p><p>The subcommand <strong>input</strong> reads a single character from the window without echoing it back.  If <em>param</em> is supplied the character is assigned to the parameter <em>param</em>, else it is assigned to the parameter <em>REPLY</em>.</p><p>If both <em>param</em> and <em>kparam</em> are supplied, the key is read in `keypad' mode.  In this mode special keys such as function keys and arrow keys return the name of the key in the parameter <em>kparam</em>.  The key names are the macros defined in the <strong>curses.h</strong> or <strong>ncurses.h</strong> with the prefix `<strong>KEY_</strong>' removed; see also the description of the parameter <strong>zcurses_keycodes</strong> below.  Other keys cause a value to be set in <em>param</em> as before.  On a successful return only one of <em>param</em> or <em>kparam</em> contains a non-empty string; the other is set to an empty string.</p><p>If <em>mparam</em> is also supplied, <strong>input</strong> attempts to handle mouse input.  This is only available with the ncurses library; mouse handling can be detected by checking for the exit status of `<strong>zcurses mouse</strong>' with no arguments.  If a mouse button is clicked (or double- or triple-clicked, or pressed or released with a configurable delay from being clicked) then <strong>kparam</strong> is set to the string <strong>MOUSE</strong>, and <em>mparam</em> is set to an array consisting of the following elements:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>-</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>An identifier to discriminate different input devices; this is only rarely useful.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The x, y and z coordinates of the mouse click relative to the full screen, as three elements in that order (i.e. the y coordinate is, unusually, after the x coordinate).  The z coordinate is only available for a few unusual input devices and is otherwise set to zero.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Any events that occurred as separate items; usually there will be just one.  An event consists of <strong>PRESSED</strong>, <strong>RELEASED</strong>, <strong>CLICKED</strong>, <strong>DOUBLE_CLICKED</strong> or <strong>TRIPLE_CLICKED</strong> followed immediately (in the same element) by the number of the button.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the shift key was pressed, the string <strong>SHIFT</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the control key was pressed, the string <strong>CTRL</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>-</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the alt key was pressed, the string <strong>ALT</strong>.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Not all mouse events may be passed through to the terminal window; most terminal emulators handle some mouse events themselves.  Note that the ncurses manual implies that using input both with and without mouse handling may cause the mouse cursor to appear and disappear.</p><p>The subcommand <strong>mouse</strong> can be used to configure the use of the mouse. There is no window argument; mouse options are global. `<strong>zcurses mouse</strong>' with no arguments returns status 0 if mouse handling is possible, else status 1.  Otherwise, the possible arguments (which may be combined on the same command line) are as follows. <strong>delay</strong> <em>num</em> sets the maximum delay in milliseconds between press and release events to be considered as a click; the value 0 disables click resolution, and the default is one sixth of a second.  <strong>motion</strong> proceeded by an optional `<strong>+</strong>' (the default) or <strong>-</strong> turns on or off reporting of mouse motion in addition to clicks, presses and releases, which are always reported.  However, it appears reports for mouse motion are not currently implemented.</p><p>The subcommand <strong>timeout</strong> specifies a timeout value for input from <em>targetwin</em>.  If <em>intval</em> is negative, `<strong>zcurses input</strong>' waits indefinitely for a character to be typed; this is the default.  If <em>intval</em> is zero, `<strong>zcurses input</strong>' returns immediately; if there is typeahead it is returned, else no input is done and status 1 is returned.  If <em>intval</em> is positive, `<strong>zcurses input</strong>' waits <em>intval</em> milliseconds for input and if there is none at the end of that period returns status 1.</p><p>The subcommand <strong>querychar</strong> queries the character at the current cursor position.  The return values are stored in the array named <em>param</em> if supplied, else in the array <strong>reply</strong>.  The first value is the character (which may be a multibyte character if the system supports them); the second is the color pair in the usual <em>fg_col</em><strong>/</strong><em>bg_col</em> notation, or <strong>0</strong> if color is not supported.  Any attributes other than color that apply to the character, as set with the subcommand <strong>attr</strong>, appear as additional elements.</p>

    <p>Output the date denoted by <em>epochtime</em> in the <em>format</em> specified.</p><p>With the option <strong>-r</strong> (reverse), use the format <em>format</em> to parse the input string <em>timestring</em> and output the number of seconds since the epoch at which the time occurred.  If no timezone is parsed, the current timezone is used; other parameters are set to zero if not present.  If <em>timestring</em> does not match <em>format</em> the command returns status 1; it will additionally print an error message unless the option <strong>-q</strong> (quiet) is given.  If <em>timestring</em> matches <em>format</em> but not all characters in <em>timestring</em> were used, the conversion succeeds; however, a warning is issued unless the option <strong>-q</strong> is given.  The matching is implemented by the system function <strong>strptime</strong>; see <a href="../man3/strptime.3.html"><strong>strptime</strong>(3)</a>.  This means that zsh format extensions are not available, however for reverse lookup they are not required.  If the function is not implemented, the command returns status 2 and (unless <strong>-q</strong> is given) prints a message.</p><p>If <strong>-s</strong> <em>scalar</em> is given, assign the date string (or epoch time in seconds if <strong>-r</strong> is given) to <em>scalar</em> instead of printing it.</p>

The value may also be assigned to, in which case the file in question is written (whether or not it originally existed); or an element may be unset, which will delete the file in question.  For example, `<strong>vared mapfile[myfile]</strong>' works as expected, editing the file `<strong>myfile</strong>'.</p><p>When the array is accessed as a whole, the keys are the names of files in the current directory, and the values are empty (to save a huge overhead in memory).  Thus <strong>${(k)mapfile}</strong> has the same affect as the glob operator <strong>*(D)</strong>, since files beginning with a dot are not special.  Care must be taken with expressions such as <strong>rm ${(k)mapfile}</strong>, which will delete every file in the current directory without the usual `<strong>rm *</strong>' test.</p><p>The parameter <strong>mapfile</strong> may be made read-only; in that case, files referenced may not be written or deleted.</p><p>A file may conveniently be read into an array as one line per element with the form `<em>array</em><strong>=("${(f@)mapfile[</strong><em>filename</em><strong>]}")</strong>'. The double quotes and the `<strong>@</strong>' are necessary to prevent empty lines from being removed.  Note that if the file ends with a newline, the shell will split on the final newline, generating an additional empty field; this can be suppressed by using `<em>array</em><strong>=("${(f@)${mapfile[</strong><em>filename</em><strong>]%$'&#92;n'}}")</strong>'.</p>
  </dd>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Although reading and writing of the file in question is efficiently handled, zsh's internal memory management may be arbitrarily baroque; however, <strong>mapfile</strong> is usually very much more efficient than anything involving a loop.  Note in particular that the whole contents of the file will always reside physically in memory when accessed (possibly multiple times, due to standard parameter substitution operations).  In particular, this means handling of sufficiently long files (greater than the machine's swap space, or than the range of the pointer type) will be incorrect.</p><p>No errors are printed or flagged for non-existent, unreadable, or unwritable files, as the parameter mechanism is too low in the shell execution hierarchy to make this convenient.</p><p>It is unfortunate that the mechanism for loading modules does not yet allow the user to specify the name of the shell parameter to be given the special behaviour.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">THE ZSH/MATHFUNC MODULE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <strong>zsh/mathfunc</strong> module provides standard mathematical functions for use when evaluating mathematical formulae.  The syntax agrees with normal C and FORTRAN conventions, for example,</p>
<pre>
<strong>(( f = sin(0.3) ))</strong>
</pre>
<p>assigns the sine of 0.3 to the parameter f.</p><p>Most functions take floating point arguments and return a floating point value.  However, any necessary conversions from or to integer type will be performed automatically by the shell.  Apart from <strong>atan</strong> with a second argument and the <strong>abs</strong>, <strong>int</strong> and <strong>float</strong> functions, all functions behave as noted in the manual page for the corresponding C function, except that any arguments out of range for the function in question will be detected by the shell and an error reported.</p><p>The following functions take a single floating point argument: <strong>acos</strong>, <strong>acosh</strong>, <strong>asin</strong>, <strong>asinh</strong>, <strong>atan</strong>, <strong>atanh</strong>, <strong>cbrt</strong>, <strong>ceil</strong>, <strong>cos</strong>, <strong>cosh</strong>, <strong>erf</strong>, <strong>erfc</strong>, <strong>exp</strong>, <strong>expm1</strong>, <strong>fabs</strong>, <strong>floor</strong>, <strong>gamma</strong>, <strong>j0</strong>, <strong>j1</strong>, <strong>lgamma</strong>, <strong>log</strong>, <strong>log10</strong>, <strong>log1p</strong>, <strong>logb</strong>, <strong>sin</strong>, <strong>sinh</strong>, <strong>sqrt</strong>, <strong>tan</strong>, <strong>tanh</strong>, <strong>y0</strong>, <strong>y1</strong>.  The <strong>atan</strong> function can optionally take a second argument, in which case it behaves like the C function <strong>atan2</strong>. The <strong>ilogb</strong> function takes a single floating point argument, but returns an integer.</p><p>The function <strong>signgam</strong> takes no arguments, and returns an integer, which is the C variable of the same name, as described in <a href="../man3/gamma.3.html"><strong>gamma</strong>(3)</a>.  Note that it is therefore only useful immediately after a call to <strong>gamma</strong> or <strong>lgamma</strong>.  Note also that `<strong>signgam()</strong>' and `<strong>signgam</strong>' are distinct expressions.</p><p>The following functions take two floating point arguments: <strong>copysign</strong>, <strong>fmod</strong>, <strong>hypot</strong>, <strong>nextafter</strong>.</p><p>The following take an integer first argument and a floating point second argument: <strong>jn</strong>, <strong>yn</strong>.</p><p>The following take a floating point first argument and an integer second argument: <strong>ldexp</strong>, <strong>scalb</strong>.</p><p>The function <strong>abs</strong> does not convert the type of its single argument; it returns the absolute value of either a floating point number or an integer.  The functions <strong>float</strong> and <strong>int</strong> convert their arguments into a floating point or integer value (by truncation) respectively.</p><p>Note that the C <strong>pow</strong> function is available in ordinary math evaluation as the `<strong>**</strong>' operator and is not provided here.</p><p>The function <strong>rand48</strong> is available if your system's mathematical library has the function <a href="../man3/erand48.3.html"><strong>erand48</strong>(3)</a></strong>.  It returns a pseudo-random floating point number between 0 and 1.  It takes a single string optional argument.</p><p>If the argument is not present, the random number seed is initialised by three calls to the <a href="../man3/rand.3.html"><strong>rand</strong>(3)</a></strong> function --- this produces the same random numbers as the next three values of <strong>$RANDOM</strong>.</p><p>If the argument is present, it gives the name of a scalar parameter where the current random number seed will be stored.  On the first call, the value must contain at least twelve hexadecimal digits (the remainder of the string is ignored), or the seed will be initialised in the same manner as for a call to <strong>rand48</strong> with no argument.  Subsequent calls to <strong>rand48</strong>(<em>param</em>) will then maintain the seed in the parameter <em>param</em> as a string of twelve hexadecimal digits, with no base signifier.  The random number sequences for different parameters are completely independent, and are also independent from that used by calls to <strong>rand48</strong> with no argument.</p><p>For example, consider</p>
<pre>
<strong>print $(( rand48(seed) ))</strong>
print $(( rand48() ))
print $(( rand48(seed) ))
</pre>
<p>Assuming <strong>$seed</strong> does not exist, it will be initialised by the first call.  In the second call, the default seed is initialised; note, however, that because of the properties of <strong>rand()</strong> there is a correlation between the seeds used for the two initialisations, so for more secure uses, you should generate your own 12-byte seed.  The third call returns to the same sequence of random numbers used in the first call, unaffected by the intervening <strong>rand48()</strong>.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">THE ZSH/NEWUSER MODULE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <strong>zsh/newuser</strong> module is loaded at boot if it is available, the <strong>RCS</strong> option is set, and the <strong>PRIVILEGED</strong> option is not set (all three are true by default).  This takes place immediately after commands in the global <strong>zshenv</strong> file (typically <strong>/etc/zsh/zshenv</strong>), if any, have been executed.  If the module is not available it is silently ignored by the shell; the module may safely be removed from <strong>$MODULE_PATH</strong> by the administrator if it is not required.</p><p>On loading, the module tests if any of the start-up files <strong>.zshenv</strong>, <strong>.zprofile</strong>, <strong>.zshrc</strong> or <strong>.zlogin</strong> exist in the directory given by the environment variable <strong>ZDOTDIR</strong>, or the user's home directory if that is not set.  The test is not performed and the module halts processing if the shell was in an emulation mode (i.e. had been invoked as some other shell than zsh).</p><p>If none of the start-up files were found, the module then looks for the file <strong>newuser</strong> first in a sitewide directory, usually the parent directory of the <strong>site-functions</strong> directory, and if that is not found the module searches in a version-specific directory, usually the parent of the <strong>functions</strong> directory containing version-specific functions.  (These directories can be configured when zsh is built using the <strong>--enable-site-scriptdir=</strong><em>dir</em> and <strong>--enable-scriptdir=</strong><em>dir</em> flags to <strong>configure</strong>, respectively; the defaults are <em>prefix</em><strong>/share/zsh</strong> and <em>prefix</em><strong>/share/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION</strong> where the default <em>prefix</em> is <strong>/usr/local</strong>.)</p><p>If the file <strong>newuser</strong> is found, it is then sourced in the same manner as a start-up file.  The file is expected to contain code to install start-up files for the user, however any valid shell code will be executed.</p><p>The <strong>zsh/newuser</strong> module is then unconditionally unloaded.</p><p>Note that it is possible to achieve exactly the same effect as the <strong>zsh/newuser</strong> module by adding code to <strong>/etc/zsh/zshenv</strong>.  The module exists simply to allow the shell to make arrangements for new users without the need for intervention by package maintainers and system administrators.</p><p>The script supplied with the module invokes the shell function <strong>zsh-newuser-install</strong>.  This may be invoked directly by the user even if the <strong>zsh/newuser</strong> module is disabled.  Note, however, that if the module is not installed the function will not be installed either. The function is documented in the section User Configuration Functions in <a href="../man1/zshcontrib.1.html"><strong>zshcontrib</strong>(1)</a>.</p>

    <p>Returns successfully if <strong>string</strong> matches the previously-compiled PCRE.</p><p>Upon successful match, if the expression captures substrings within parentheses, <strong>pcre_match</strong> will set the array <em>$match</em> to those substrings, unless the <strong>-a</strong> option is given, in which case it will set the array <em>arr</em>.  Similarly, the variable <em>MATCH</em> will be set to the entire matched portion of the string, unless the <strong>-v</strong> option is given, in which case the variable <em>var</em> will be set. No variables are altered if there is no successful match. A <strong>-n</strong> option starts searching for a match from the byte <em>offset</em> position in <em>string</em>.  If the <strong>-b</strong> option is given, the variable <em>ZPCRE_OP</em> will be set to an offset pair string, representing the byte offset positions of the entire matched portion within the <em>string</em>.  For example, a <em>ZPCRE_OP</em> set to "32 45" indicates that the matched portion began on byte offset 32 and ended on byte offset 44. Here, byte offset position 45 is the position directly after the matched portion.  Keep in mind that the byte position isn't necessarily the same as the character position when UTF-8 characters are involved. Consequently, the byte offset positions are only to be relied on in the context of using them for subsequent searches on <em>string</em>, using an offset position as an argument to the <strong>-n</strong> option.  This is mostly used to implement the "find all non-overlapping matches" functionality.</p><p>A simple example of "find all non-overlapping matches":</p>

In the latter case it is useful to be able to produce output that does not interfere with the line being edited.  Providing the option <strong>-o</strong> causes the shell to clear the command line before the event and redraw it afterwards.  This should be used with any scheduled event that produces visible output to the terminal; it is not needed, for example, with output that updates a terminal emulator's title bar.</p><p>The <strong>sched</strong> builtin is not made available by default when the shell starts in a mode emulating another shell.

    <p>The command acts as a front end to the <strong>stat</strong> system call (see <a href="../man2/stat.2.html"><strong>stat</strong>(2)</a>).  The same command is provided with two names; as the name <strong>stat</strong> is often used by an external command it is recommended that only the <strong>zstat</strong> form of the command is used.  This can be arranged by loading the module with the command `<strong>zmodload -F zsh/stat</strong> b:zstat'.</p><p>If the <strong>stat</strong> call fails, the appropriate system error message printed and status 1 is returned.

If <em>countvar</em> is given, the number of bytes read is assigned to the parameter named by <em>countvar</em>.</p><p>The maximum number of bytes read is <em>bufsize</em> or 8192 if that is not given, however the command returns as soon as any number of bytes was successfully read.</p><p>If <em>timeout</em> is given, it specifies a timeout in seconds, which may be zero to poll the file descriptor.  This is handled by the <strong>poll</strong> system call if available, otherwise the <strong>select</strong> system call if available.</p><p>If <em>outfd</em> is given, an attempt is made to write all the bytes just read to the file descriptor <em>outfd</em>.  If this fails, because of a system error other than <strong>EINTR</strong> or because of an internal zsh error during an interrupt, the bytes read but not written are stored in the parameter named by <em>param</em> if supplied (no default is used in this case), and the number of bytes read but not written is stored in the parameter named by <em>countvar</em> if that is supplied.  If it was successful, <em>countvar</em> contains the full number of bytes transferred, as usual, and <em>param</em> is not set.</p><p>The error <strong>EINTR</strong> (interrupted system call) is handled internally so that shell interrupts are transparent to the caller.

    <p>The builtin <strong>zsystem</strong>'s subcommand <strong>flock</strong> performs advisory file locking (via the <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html"><strong>fcntl</strong>(2)</a> system call) over the entire contents of the given file.  This form of locking requires the processes accessing the file to cooperate; its most obvious use is between two instances of the shell itself.</p><p>In the first form the named <em>file</em>, which must already exist, is locked by opening a file descriptor to the file and applying a lock to the file descriptor.  The lock terminates when the shell process that created the lock exits; it is therefore often convenient to create file locks within subshells, since the lock is automatically released when the subshell exits.  Status 0 is returned if the lock succeeds, else status 1.</p><p>In the second form the file descriptor given by the arithmetic expression <strong>fd_expr</strong> is closed, releasing a lock.  The file descriptor can be queried by using the `<strong>-f</strong> <em>var</em>' form during the lock; on a successful lock, the shell variable <em>var</em> is set to the file descriptor used for locking.  The lock will be released if the file descriptor is closed by any other means, for example using `<strong>exec {</strong><em>var</em><strong>}&gt;&-</strong>'; however, the form described here performs a safety check that the file descriptor is in use for file locking.</p><p>By default the shell waits indefinitely for the lock to succeed. The option <strong>-t</strong> <em>timeout</em> specifies a timeout for the lock in seconds; currently this must be an integer.  The shell will attempt to lock the file once a second during this period.  If the attempt times out, status 2 is returned.</p><p>If the option <strong>-e</strong> is given, the file descriptor for the lock is preserved when the shell uses <strong>exec</strong> to start a new process; otherwise it is closed at that point and the lock released.</p><p>If the option <strong>-r</strong> is given, the lock is only for reading, otherwise it is for reading and writing.  The file descriptor is opened accordingly.</p>

It operates silently unless there was a syntax error (i.e. the wrong number of arguments), in which case status 255 is returned.

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Here is how to create a TCP connection between two instances of zsh.  We need to pick an unassigned port; here we use the randomly chosen 5123.</p><p>On <strong>host1</strong>,</p>
<pre>
<strong>zmodload zsh/net/tcp</strong>
ztcp -l 5123
listenfd=$REPLY
ztcp -a $listenfd
fd=$REPLY
</pre>
<p>The second from last command blocks until there is an incoming connection.</p><p>Now create a connection from <strong>host2</strong> (which may, of course, be the same machine):</p>
<pre>
<strong>zmodload zsh/net/tcp</strong>
ztcp host1 5123
fd=$REPLY
</pre>
<p>Now on each host, <strong>$fd</strong> contains a file descriptor for talking to the other.  For example, on <strong>host1</strong>:</p>
<pre>
<strong>print This is a message &gt;&$fd</strong>
</pre>
<p>and on <strong>host2</strong>:</p>
<pre>
<strong>read -r line &lt;&$fd; print -r - $line</strong>
</pre>
<p>prints `<strong>This is a message</strong>'.</p><p>To tidy up, on <strong>host1</strong>:</p>
<pre>
<strong>ztcp -c $listenfd</strong>
ztcp -c $fd
</pre>
<p>and on <strong>host2</strong></p>
<pre>
<strong>ztcp -c $fd</strong>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <strong>zsh/zftp</strong> module is a client for FTP (file transfer protocol).  It is implemented as a builtin to allow full use of shell command line editing, file I/O, and job control mechanisms.  Often, users will access it via shell functions providing a more powerful interface; a set is provided with the <strong>zsh</strong> distribution and is described in <a href="../man1/zshzftpsys.1.html"><strong>zshzftpsys</strong>(1)</a>.  However, the <strong>zftp</strong> command is entirely usable in its own right.</p><p>All commands consist of the command name <strong>zftp</strong> followed by the name of a subcommand.  These are listed below.  The return status of each subcommand is supposed to reflect the success or failure of the remote operation.  See a description of the variable <strong>ZFTP_VERBOSE</strong> for more information on how responses from the server may be printed.</p>

<h3>Subcommands</h3>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>open</strong> <em>host</em>[<strong>:</strong><em>port</em>] [ <em>user</em> [ <em>password</em> [ <em>account</em> ] ] ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Open a new FTP session to <em>host</em>, which may be the name of a TCP/IP connected host or an IP number in the standard dot notation.  If the argument is in the form <em>host</em><strong>:</strong><em>port</em>, open a connection to TCP port <em>port</em> instead of the standard FTP port 21.  This may be the name of a TCP service or a number:  see the description of <strong>ZFTP_PORT</strong> below for more information.</p><p>If IPv6 addresses in colon format are used, the <em>host</em> should be surrounded by quoted square brackets to distinguish it from the <em>port</em>, for example <strong>'[fe80::203:baff:fe02:8b56]'</strong>.  For consistency this is allowed with all forms of <em>host</em>.</p><p>Remaining arguments are passed to the <strong>login</strong> subcommand.  Note that if no arguments beyond <em>host</em> are supplied, <strong>open</strong> will <em>not</em> automatically call <strong>login</strong>.  If no arguments at all are supplied, <strong>open</strong> will use the parameters set by the <strong>params</strong> subcommand.</p><p>After a successful open, the shell variables <strong>ZFTP_HOST</strong>, <strong>ZFTP_PORT</strong>, <strong>ZFTP_IP</strong> and <strong>ZFTP_SYSTEM</strong> are available; see `Variables' below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>login</strong> [ <em>name</em> [ <em>password</em> [ <em>account</em> ] ] ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>user</strong> [ <em>name</em> [ <em>password</em> [ <em>account</em> ] ] ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Login the user <em>name</em> with parameters <em>password</em> and <em>account</em>. Any of the parameters can be omitted, and will be read from standard input if needed (<em>name</em> is always needed).  If standard input is a terminal, a prompt for each one will be printed on standard error and <em>password</em> will not be echoed.  If any of the parameters are not used, a warning message is printed.</p><p>After a successful login, the shell variables <strong>ZFTP_USER</strong>, <strong>ZFTP_ACCOUNT</strong> and <strong>ZFTP_PWD</strong> are available; see `Variables' below.</p><p>This command may be re-issued when a user is already logged in, and the server will first be reinitialized for a new user.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>params</strong> [ <em>host</em> [ <em>user</em> [ <em>password</em> [ <em>account</em> ] ] ] ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>params</strong> <strong>-</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Store the given parameters for a later <strong>open</strong> command with no arguments.  Only those given on the command line will be remembered. If no arguments are given, the parameters currently set are printed, although the password will appear as a line of stars; the return status is one if no parameters were set, zero otherwise.</p><p>Any of the parameters may be specified as a `<strong>?</strong>', which may need to be quoted to protect it from shell expansion.  In this case, the appropriate parameter will be read from stdin as with the <strong>login</strong> subcommand, including special handling of <em>password</em>.  If the `<strong>?</strong>' is followed by a string, that is used as the prompt for reading the parameter instead of the default message (any necessary punctuation and whitespace should be included at the end of the prompt).  The first letter of the parameter (only) may be quoted with a `<strong>&#92;</strong>'; hence an argument <strong>"&#92;&#92;$word"</strong> guarantees that the string from the shell parameter <strong>$word</strong> will be treated literally, whether or not it begins with a `<strong>?</strong>'.</p><p>If instead a single `<strong>-</strong>' is given, the existing parameters, if any, are deleted.  In that case, calling <strong>open</strong> with no arguments will cause an error.</p><p>The list of parameters is not deleted after a <strong>close</strong>, however it will be deleted if the <strong>zsh/zftp</strong> module is unloaded.</p><p>For example,</p>
<pre>
<strong>zftp params ftp.elsewhere.xx juser '?Password for juser: '</strong>
</pre>
<p>will store the host <strong>ftp.elsewhere.xx</strong> and the user <strong>juser</strong> and then prompt the user for the corresponding password with the given prompt.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>test</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Test the connection; if the server has reported that it has closed the connection (maybe due to a timeout), return status 2; if no connection was open anyway, return status 1; else return status 0.  The <strong>test</strong> subcommand is silent, apart from messages printed by the <strong>$ZFTP_VERBOSE</strong> mechanism, or error messages if the connection closes.  There is no network overhead for this test.</p><p>The test is only supported on systems with either the <a href="../man2/select.2.html"><strong>select</strong>(2)</a></strong> or <a href="../man2/poll.2.html"><strong>poll</strong>(2)</a></strong> system calls; otherwise the message `<strong>not</strong> supported on this system' is printed instead.</p><p>The <strong>test</strong> subcommand will automatically be called at the start of any other subcommand for the current session when a connection is open.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>cd</strong> <em>directory</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change the remote directory to <em>directory</em>.  Also alters the shell variable <strong>ZFTP_PWD</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>cdup</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change the remote directory to the one higher in the directory tree. Note that <strong>cd ..</strong> will also work correctly on non-UNIX systems.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>dir</strong> [ <em>args...</em> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Give a (verbose) listing of the remote directory.  The <em>args</em> are passed directly to the server. The command's behaviour is implementation dependent, but a UNIX server will typically interpret <em>args</em> as arguments to the <strong>ls</strong> command and with no arguments return the result of `<strong>ls -l</strong>'. The directory is listed to standard output.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ls</strong> [ <em>args</em> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Give a (short) listing of the remote directory.  With no <em>args</em>, produces a raw list of the files in the directory, one per line. Otherwise, up to vagaries of the server implementation, behaves similar to <strong>dir</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>type</strong> [ <em>type</em> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change the type for the transfer to <em>type</em>, or print the current type if <em>type</em> is absent.  The allowed values are `<strong>A</strong>' (ASCII), `<strong>I</strong>' (Image, i.e. binary), or `<strong>B</strong>' (a synonym for `<strong>I</strong>').</p><p>The FTP default for a transfer is ASCII.  However, if <strong>zftp</strong> finds that the remote host is a UNIX machine with 8-bit byes, it will automatically switch to using binary for file transfers upon <strong>open</strong>.  This can subsequently be overridden.</p><p>The transfer type is only passed to the remote host when a data connection is established; this command involves no network overhead.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ascii</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The same as <strong>type A</strong>.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The same as <strong>type I</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>mode</strong> [ <strong>S</strong> | <strong>B</strong> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the mode type to stream (<strong>S</strong>) or block (<strong>B</strong>).  Stream mode is the default; block mode is not widely supported.</p>

    <p><strong>remote</strong> <em>files...</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>local</strong> [ <em>files...</em> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Print the size and last modification time of the remote or local files.  If there is more than one item on the list, the name of the file is printed first.  The first number is the file size, the second is the last modification time of the file in the format <strong>CCYYMMDDhhmmSS</strong> consisting of year, month, date, hour, minutes and seconds in GMT.  Note that this format, including the length, is guaranteed, so that time strings can be directly compared via the <strong>[[</strong> builtin's <strong>&lt;</strong> and <strong>&gt;</strong> operators, even if they are too long to be represented as integers.</p><p>Not all servers support the commands for retrieving this information. In that case, the <strong>remote</strong> command will print nothing and return status 2, compared with status 1 for a file not found.</p><p>The <strong>local</strong> command (but not <strong>remote</strong>) may be used with no arguments, in which case the information comes from examining file descriptor zero.  This is the same file as seen by a <strong>put</strong> command with no further redirection.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>get</strong> <em>file</em> [...]</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Versions of <strong>get</strong>, <strong>put</strong> and <strong>append</strong> which will start the transfer at the given <em>point</em> in the remote <em>file</em>.  This is useful for appending to an incomplete local file.  However, note that this ability is not universally supported by servers (and is not quite the behaviour specified by the standard).</p>
  </dd>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>quote</strong> <em>args...</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Send the raw FTP command sequence to the server.  You should be familiar with the FTP command set as defined in RFC959 before doing this.  Useful commands may include <strong>STAT</strong> and <strong>HELP</strong>.  Note also the mechanism for returning messages as described for the variable <strong>ZFTP_VERBOSE</strong> below, in particular that all messages from the control connection are sent to standard error.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>quit</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Close the current data connection.  This unsets the shell parameters <strong>ZFTP_HOST</strong>, <strong>ZFTP_PORT</strong>, <strong>ZFTP_IP</strong>, <strong>ZFTP_SYSTEM</strong>, <strong>ZFTP_USER</strong>, <strong>ZFTP_ACCOUNT</strong>, <strong>ZFTP_PWD</strong>, <strong>ZFTP_TYPE</strong> and <strong>ZFTP_MODE</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>session</strong> [ <em>sessname</em> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Allows multiple FTP sessions to be used at once.  The name of the session is an arbitrary string of characters; the default session is called `<strong>default</strong>'.  If this command is called without an argument, it will list all the current sessions; with an argument, it will either switch to the existing session called <em>sessname</em>, or create a new session of that name.</p><p>Each session remembers the status of the connection, the set of connection-specific shell parameters (the same set as are unset when a connection closes, as given in the description of <strong>close</strong>), and any user parameters specified with the <strong>params</strong> subcommand.  Changing to a previous session restores those values; changing to a new session initialises them in the same way as if <strong>zftp</strong> had just been loaded.  The name of the current session is given by the parameter <strong>ZFTP_SESSION</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>rmsession</strong> [ <em>sessname</em> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Delete a session; if a name is not given, the current session is deleted. If the current session is deleted, the earliest existing session becomes the new current session, otherwise the current session is not changed. If the session being deleted is the only one, a new session called `<strong>default</strong>' is created and becomes the current session; note that this is a new session even if the session being deleted is also called `<strong>default</strong>'. It is recommended that sessions not be deleted while background commands which use <strong>zftp</strong> are still active.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>The following shell parameters are used by <strong>zftp</strong>.  Currently none of them are special.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_TMOUT</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Integer.  The time in seconds to wait for a network operation to complete before returning an error.  If this is not set when the module is loaded, it will be given the default value 60.  A value of zero turns off timeouts.  If a timeout occurs on the control connection it will be closed.  Use a larger value if this occurs too frequently.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_IP</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Readonly.  The IP address of the current connection in dot notation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_HOST</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Readonly.  The hostname of the current remote server.  If the host was opened as an IP number, <strong>ZFTP_HOST</strong> contains that instead; this saves the overhead for a name lookup, as IP numbers are most commonly used when a nameserver is unavailable.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_PORT</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Readonly.  The number of the remote TCP port to which the connection is open (even if the port was originally specified as a named service). Usually this is the standard FTP port, 21.</p><p>In the unlikely event that your system does not have the appropriate conversion functions, this appears in network byte order.  If your system is little-endian, the port then consists of two swapped bytes and the standard port will be reported as 5376.  In that case, numeric ports passed to <strong>zftp open</strong> will also need to be in this format.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_SYSTEM</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Readonly.  The system type string returned by the server in response to an FTP <strong>SYST</strong> request.  The most interesting case is a string beginning <strong>"UNIX Type: L8"</strong>, which ensures maximum compatibility with a local UNIX host.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_TYPE</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Readonly.  The type to be used for data transfers , either `<strong>A</strong>' or `<strong>I</strong>'.   Use the <strong>type</strong> subcommand to change this.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_USER</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Readonly.  The username currently logged in, if any.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_ACCOUNT</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Readonly.  The account name of the current user, if any.  Most servers do not require an account name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_PWD</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Readonly.  The current directory on the server.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_CODE</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Readonly.  The three digit code of the last FTP reply from the server as a string.  This can still be read after the connection is closed, and is not changed when the current session changes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_REPLY</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Readonly.  The last line of the last reply sent by the server.  This can still be read after the connection is closed, and is not changed when the current session changes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_SESSION</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Readonly.  The name of the current FTP session; see the description of the <strong>session</strong> subcommand.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_PREFS</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A string of preferences for altering aspects of <strong>zftp</strong>'s behaviour. Each preference is a single character.  The following are defined:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>P</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Passive:  attempt to make the remote server initiate data transfers. This is slightly more efficient than sendport mode.  If the letter <strong>S</strong> occurs later in the string, <strong>zftp</strong> will use sendport mode if passive mode is not available.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>S</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Sendport:  initiate transfers by the FTP <strong>PORT</strong> command.  If this occurs before any <strong>P</strong> in the string, passive mode will never be attempted.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>D</strong></p>
  </dt>

This prevents the variables <strong>ZFTP_SYSTEM</strong> and <strong>ZFTP_PWD</strong> from being set, and will mean all connections default to ASCII type.

  </dd>

If any of the numbers 1 to 5 appear in the string, raw responses from the server with reply codes beginning with that digit will be printed to standard error.  The first digit of the three digit reply code is defined by RFC959 to correspond to:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>

<p>It should be noted that, for unknown reasons, the reply `Service not available', which forces termination of a connection, is classified as 421, i.e. `transient negative', an interesting interpretation of the word `transient'.</p><p>The code 0 is special:  it indicates that all but the last line of multiline replies read from the server will be printed to standard error in a processed format.  By convention, servers use this mechanism for sending information for the user to read.

<h3>Functions</h3>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>zftp_chpwd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this function is set by the user, it is called every time the directory changes on the server, including when a user is logged in, or when a connection is closed.  In the last case, <strong>$ZFTP_PWD</strong> will be unset; otherwise it will reflect the new directory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>zftp_progress</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this function is set by the user, it will be called during a <strong>get</strong>, <strong>put</strong> or <strong>append</strong> operation each time sufficient data has been received from the host.  During a <strong>get</strong>, the data is sent to standard output, so it is vital that this function should write to standard error or directly to the terminal, <em>not</em> to standard output.</p><p>When it is called with a transfer in progress, the following additional shell parameters are set:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_FILE</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The name of the remote file being transferred from or to.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_TRANSFER</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A <strong>G</strong> for a <strong>get</strong> operation and a <strong>P</strong> for a <strong>put</strong> operation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_SIZE</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The total size of the complete file being transferred: the same as the first value provided by the <strong>remote</strong> and <strong>local</strong> subcommands for a particular file. If the server cannot supply this value for a remote file being retrieved, it will not be set.  If input is from a pipe the value may be incorrect and correspond simply to a full pipe buffer.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZFTP_COUNT</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The amount of data so far transferred; a number between zero and <strong>$ZFTP_SIZE</strong>, if that is set.  This number is always available.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The function is initially called with <strong>ZFTP_TRANSFER</strong> set appropriately and <strong>ZFTP_COUNT</strong> set to zero.  After the transfer is finished, the function will be called one more time with <strong>ZFTP_TRANSFER</strong> set to <strong>GF</strong> or <strong>PF</strong>, in case it wishes to tidy up.  It is otherwise never called twice with the same value of <strong>ZFTP_COUNT</strong>.</p><p>Sometimes the progress meter may cause disruption.  It is up to the user to decide whether the function should be defined and to use <strong>unfunction</strong> when necessary.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>Problems</h3>
<p>A connection may not be opened in the left hand side of a pipe as this occurs in a subshell and the file information is not updated in the main shell.  In the case of type or mode changes or closing the connection in a subshell, the information is returned but variables are not updated until the next call to <strong>zftp</strong>.  Other status changes in subshells will not be reflected by changes to the variables (but should be otherwise harmless).</p><p>Deleting sessions while a <strong>zftp</strong> command is active in the background can have unexpected effects, even if it does not use the session being deleted. This is because all shell subprocesses share information on the state of all connections, and deleting a session changes the ordering of that information.</p><p>On some operating systems, the control connection is not valid after a fork(), so that operations in subshells, on the left hand side of a pipeline, or in the background are not possible, as they should be. This is presumably a bug in the operating system.</p>

This summary is sorted in decreasing order of the amount of time spent in each.  The lines contain the number of the function in order, which is used in other parts of the list in suffixes of the form `<strong>[</strong><em>num</em><strong>]</strong>', then the number of calls made to the function. The next three columns list the time in milliseconds spent in the function and its descendants, the average time in milliseconds spent in the function and its descendants per call and the percentage of time spent in all shell functions used in this function and its descendants.  The following three columns give the same information, but counting only the time spent in the function itself.  The final column shows the name of the function.</p><p>After the summary, detailed information about every function that was invoked is listed, sorted in decreasing order of the amount of time spent in each function and its descendants.  Each of these entries consists of descriptions for the functions that called the function described, the function itself, and the functions that were called from it.  The description for the function itself has the same format as in the summary (and shows the same information).  The other lines don't show the number of the function at the beginning and have their function named indented to make it easier to distinguish the line showing the function described in the section from the surrounding lines.</p><p>The information shown in this case is almost the same as in the summary, but only refers to the call hierarchy being displayed.  For example, for a calling function the column showing the total running time lists the time spent in the described function and its descendants only for the times when it was called from that particular calling function.  Likewise, for a called function, this columns lists the total time spent in the called function and its descendants only for the times when it was called from the function described.</p><p>Also in this case, the column showing the number of calls to a function also shows a slash and then the total number of invocations made to the called function.</p><p>As long as the <strong>zsh/zprof</strong> module is loaded, profiling will be done and multiple invocations of the <strong>zprof</strong> builtin command will show the times and numbers of calls since the module was loaded.  With the <strong>-c</strong> option, the <strong>zprof</strong> builtin command will reset its internal counters and will not show the listing.</p>

    <p>The arguments following <em>name</em> are concatenated with spaces between, then executed as a command, as if passed to the <strong>eval</strong> builtin.  The command runs under a newly assigned pseudo-terminal; this is useful for running commands non-interactively which expect an interactive environment.

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">THE ZSH/ZSELECT MODULE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <strong>zsh/zselect</strong> module makes available one builtin command:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>zselect</strong> [ <strong>-rwe</strong> <strong>-t</strong> <em>timeout</em> <strong>-a</strong> <em>array</em> ] [ <em>fd</em> ... ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <strong>zselect</strong> builtin is a front-end to the `select' system call, which blocks until a file descriptor is ready for reading or writing, or has an error condition, with an optional timeout.  If this is not available on your system, the command prints an error message and returns status 2 (normal errors return status 1).  For more information, see your systems documentation for <strong>select</strong>(3).  Note there is no connection with the shell builtin of the same name.</p><p>Arguments and options may be intermingled in any order.  Non-option arguments are file descriptors, which must be decimal integers.  By default, file descriptors are to be tested for reading, i.e. <strong>zselect</strong> will return when data is available to be read from the file descriptor, or more precisely, when a read operation from the file descriptor will not block.  After a <strong>-r</strong>, <strong>-w</strong> and <strong>-e</strong>, the given file descriptors are to be tested for reading, writing, or error conditions.  These options and an arbitrary list of file descriptors may be given in any order.</p><p>(The presence of an `error condition' is not well defined in the documentation for many implementations of the select system call. According to recent versions of the POSIX specification, it is really an <em>exception</em> condition, of which the only standard example is out-of-band data received on a socket.  So zsh users are unlikely to find the <strong>-e</strong> option useful.)</p><p>The option `<strong>-t</strong> <em>timeout</em>' specifies a timeout in hundredths of a second.  This may be zero, in which case the file descriptors will simply be polled and <strong>zselect</strong> will return immediately.  It is possible to call zselect with no file descriptors and a non-zero timeout for use as a finer-grained replacement for `sleep'; note, however, the return status is always 1 for a timeout.</p><p>The option `<strong>-a</strong> <em>array</em>' indicates that <strong>array</strong> should be set to indicate the file descriptor(s) which are ready.  If the option is not given, the array <strong>reply</strong> will be used for this purpose.  The array will contain a string similar to the arguments for <strong>zselect</strong>.  For example,</p>
<pre>
<strong>zselect -t 0 -r 0 -w 1</strong>
</pre>
<p>might return immediately with status 0 and <strong>$reply</strong> containing `<strong>-r 0 -w</strong> 1' to show that both file descriptors are ready for the requested operations.</p><p>The option `<strong>-A</strong> <em>assoc</em>' indicates that the associative array <strong>assoc</strong> should be set to indicate the file descriptor(s( which are ready.  This option overrides the option <strong>-a</strong>, nor will <strong>reply</strong> be modified.  The keys of <strong>assoc</strong> are the file descriptors, and the corresponding values are any of the characters `<strong>rwe</strong>' to indicate the condition.</p><p>The command returns status 0 if some file descriptors are ready for reading.  If the operation timed out, or a timeout of 0 was given and no file descriptors were ready, or there was an error, it returns status 1 and the array will not be set (nor modified in any way).  If there was an error in the select operation the appropriate error message is printed.</p>

    <p>This builtin command is used to define and lookup styles.  Styles are pairs of names and values, where the values consist of any number of strings.  They are stored together with patterns and lookup is done by giving a string, called the `context', which is compared to the patterns.  The definition stored for the first matching pattern will be returned.</p><p>For ordering of comparisons, patterns are searched from most specific to least specific, and patterns that are equally specific keep the order in which they were defined.  A pattern is considered to be more specific than another if it contains more components (substrings separated by colons) or if the patterns for the components are more specific, where simple strings are considered to be more specific than patterns and complex patterns are considered to be more specific than the pattern `<strong>*</strong>'.</p><p>The first form (without arguments) lists the definitions.  Styles are shown in alphabetic order and patterns are shown in the order <strong>zstyle</strong> will test them.</p><p>If the <strong>-L</strong> option is given, listing is done in the form of calls to <strong>zstyle</strong>.  The optional first argument is a pattern which will be matched against the string supplied as the pattern for the context; note that this means, for example, `<strong>zstyle -L ":completion:*"</strong>' will match any supplied pattern beginning `<strong>:completion:</strong>', not just <strong>":completion:*"</strong>:  use <strong>":completion:&#92;*"</strong> to match that. The optional second argument limits the output to a specific style (not a pattern).  <strong>-L</strong> is not compatible with any other options.</p><p>The other forms are the following:</p>

If the <strong>-e</strong> option is given, the <em>strings</em> will be concatenated (separated by spaces) and the resulting string will be evaluated (in the same way as it is done by the <strong>eval</strong> builtin command) when the style is looked up.  In this case the parameter `<strong>reply</strong>' must be assigned to set the strings returned after the evaluation.  Before evaluating the value, <strong>reply</strong> is unset, and if it is still unset after the evaluation, the style is treated as if it were not set.</p>

In this case the <em>format</em> string will be modified by replacing sequences starting with a percent sign in it with strings from the <em>specs</em>.  Each <em>spec</em> should be of the form `<em>char</em><strong>:</strong><em>string</em>' which will cause every appearance of the sequence `<strong>%</strong><em>char</em>' in <em>format</em> to be replaced by the <em>string</em>.  The `<strong>%</strong>' sequence may also contain optional minimum and maximum field width specifications between the `<strong>%</strong>' and the `<em>char</em>' in the form `<strong>%</strong><em>min</em><strong>.</strong><em>max</em><strong>c</strong>', i.e. the minimum field width is given first and if the maximum field width is used, it has to be preceded by a dot.  Specifying a minimum field width makes the result be padded with spaces to the right if the <em>string</em> is shorter than the requested width.  Padding to the left can be achieved by giving a negative minimum field width.  If a maximum field width is specified, the <em>string</em> will be truncated after that many characters.  After all `<strong>%</strong>' sequences for the given <em>specs</em> have been processed, the resulting string is stored in the parameter <em>param</em>.</p><p>The <strong>%</strong>-escapes also understand ternary expressions in the form used by prompts.  The <strong>%</strong> is followed by a `<strong>(</strong>' and then an ordinary format specifier character as described above.  There may be a set of digits either before or after the `<strong>(</strong>'; these specify a test number, which defaults to zero.  Negative numbers are also allowed.  An arbitrary delimiter character follows the format specifier, which is followed by a piece of `true' text, the delimiter character again, a piece of `false' text, and a closing parenthesis.  The complete expression (without the digits) thus looks like `<strong>%(</strong><em>X</em><strong>.</strong><em>text1</em><strong>.</strong><em>text2</em><strong>)</strong>', except that the `<strong>.</strong>' character is arbitrary.  The value given for the format specifier in the <em>char</em><strong>:</strong><em>string</em> expressions is evaluated as a mathematical expression, and compared with the test number.  If they are the same, <em>text1</em> is output, else <em>text2</em> is output.  A parenthesis may be escaped in <em>text2</em> as <strong>%)</strong>.  Either of <em>text1</em> or <em>text2</em> may contain nested <strong>%</strong>-escapes.</p><p>For example:</p>
<pre>
<strong>zformat -f REPLY "The answer is '%3(c.yes.no)'." c:3</strong>
</pre>
<p>outputs "The answer is 'yes'." to <strong>REPLY</strong> since the value for the format specifier <strong>c</strong> is 3, agreeing with the digit argument to the ternary expression.</p><p>The second form, using the <strong>-a</strong> option, can be used for aligning strings.  Here, the <em>specs</em> are of the form `<em>left</em><strong>:</strong><em>right</em>' where `<em>left</em>' and `<em>right</em>' are arbitrary strings.  These strings are modified by replacing the colons by the <em>sep</em> string and padding the <em>left</em> strings with spaces to the right so that the <em>sep</em> strings in the result (and hence the <em>right</em> strings after them) are all aligned if the strings are printed below each other.  All strings without a colon are left unchanged and all strings with an empty <em>right</em> string have the trailing colon removed.  In both cases the lengths of the strings are not used to determine how the other strings are to be aligned. The resulting strings are stored in the <em>array</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>zparseopts</strong> [ <strong>-D</strong> ] [ <strong>-K</strong> ] [ <strong>-M</strong> ] [ <strong>-E</strong> ] [ <strong>-a</strong> <em>array</em> ] [ <strong>-A</strong> <em>assoc</em> ] <em>specs</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This builtin simplifies the parsing of options in positional parameters, i.e. the set of arguments given by <strong>$*</strong>.  Each <em>spec</em> describes one option and must be of the form `<em>opt</em>[<strong>=</strong><em>array</em>]'.  If an option described by <em>opt</em> is found in the positional parameters it is copied into the <em>array</em> specified with the <strong>-a</strong> option; if the optional `<strong>=</strong><em>array</em>' is given, it is instead copied into that array.</p><p>Note that it is an error to give any <em>spec</em> without an `<strong>=</strong><em>array</em>' unless one of the <strong>-a</strong> or <strong>-A</strong> options is used.</p><p>Unless the <strong>-E</strong> option is given, parsing stops at the first string that isn't described by one of the <em>specs</em>.  Even with <strong>-E</strong>, parsing always stops at a positional parameter equal to `<strong>-</strong>' or `<strong>-</strong><strong>-</strong>'.</p><p>The <em>opt</em> description must be one of the following.  Any of the special characters can appear in the option name provided it is preceded by a backslash.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>name</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>name</em><strong>+</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <em>name</em> is the name of the option without the leading `<strong>-</strong>'.  To specify a GNU-style long option, one of the usual two leading `<strong>-</strong>' must be included in <em>name</em>; for example, a `<strong>-</strong><strong>-file</strong>' option is represented by a <em>name</em> of `<strong>-file</strong>'.</p><p>If a `<strong>+</strong>' appears after <em>name</em>, the option is appended to <em>array</em> each time it is found in the positional parameters; without the `<strong>+</strong>' only the <em>last</em> occurrence of the option is preserved.</p><p>If one of these forms is used, the option takes no argument, so parsing stops if the next positional parameter does not also begin with `<strong>-</strong>' (unless the <strong>-E</strong> option is used).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>name</em><strong>:</strong></p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>name</em><strong>::</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If one or two colons are given, the option takes an argument; with one colon, the argument is mandatory and with two colons it is optional.  The argument is appended to the <em>array</em> after the option itself.</p><p>An optional argument is put into the same array element as the option name (note that this makes empty strings as arguments indistinguishable).  A mandatory argument is added as a separate element unless the `<strong>:-</strong>' form is used, in which case the argument is put into the same element.</p><p>A `<strong>+</strong>' as described above may appear between the <em>name</em> and the first colon.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The options of <strong>zparseopts</strong> itself are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-a</strong> <em>array</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>As described above, this names the default array in which to store the recognised options.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-A</strong> <em>assoc</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this is given, the options and their values are also put into an associative array with the option names as keys and the arguments (if any) as the values.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-D</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this option is given, all options found are removed from the positional parameters of the calling shell or shell function, up to but not including any not described by the <em>specs</em>.  This is similar to using the <strong>shift</strong> builtin.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-K</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With this option, the arrays specified with the <strong>-a</strong> option and with the `<strong>=</strong><em>array</em>' forms are kept unchanged when none of the <em>specs</em> for them is used.  Otherwise the entire array is replaced when any of the <em>specs</em> is used.  Individual elements of associative arrays specified with the <strong>-A</strong> option are preserved by <strong>-K</strong>.  This allows assignment of default values to arrays before calling <strong>zparseopts</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-M</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This changes the assignment rules to implement a map among equivalent option names.  If any <em>spec</em> uses the `<strong>=</strong><em>array</em>' form, the string <em>array</em> is interpreted as the name of another <em>spec</em>, which is used to choose where to store the values.  If no other <em>spec</em> is found, the values are stored as usual.  This changes only the way the values are stored, not the way <strong>$*</strong> is parsed, so results may be unpredictable if the `<em>name</em><strong>+</strong>' specifier is used inconsistently.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-E</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This changes the parsing rules to <em>not</em> stop at the first string that isn't described by one of the <em>spec</em>s.  It can be used to test for or (if used together with <strong>-D</strong>) extract options and their arguments, ignoring all other options and arguments that may be in the positional parameters.</p>

<p>For example,</p>
<pre>
<strong>set -- -a -bx -c y -cz baz -cend</strong>
zparseopts a=foo b:=bar c+:=bar
</pre>
<p>will have the effect of</p>
<pre>
<strong>foo=(-a)</strong>
bar=(-b x -c y -c z)
</pre>
<p>The arguments from `<strong>baz</strong>' on will not be used.</p><p>As an example for the <strong>-E</strong> option, consider:</p>
<pre>
<strong>set -- -a x -b y -c z arg1 arg2</strong>
zparseopts -E -D b:=bar
</pre>
<p>will have the effect of</p>
<pre>
<strong>bar=(-b y)</strong>
set -- -a x -c z arg1 arg2
</pre>
<p>I.e., the option <strong>-b</strong> and its arguments are taken from the positional parameters and put into the array <strong>bar</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>-M</strong> option can be used like this:</p>
<pre>
<strong>set -- -a -bx -c y -cz baz -cend</strong>
zparseopts -A bar -M a=foo b+: c:=b
</pre>
<p>to have the effect of</p>
<pre>
<strong>foo=(-a)</strong>
bar=(-a '' -b xyz)
