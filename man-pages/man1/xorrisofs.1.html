        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>xorrisofs</strong> produces Rock Ridge enhanced ISO 9660 filesystems and add-on sessions to such filesystems. Optionally it can produce Joliet directory trees too.</p><p><strong>xorrisofs</strong> understands options of program mkisofs from cdrtools by Joerg Schilling. Its implementation is part of program xorriso which shares no source code with cdrtools.</p><h3></h3>
<p><strong>ISO 9660, Rock Ridge, Joliet, HFS+:</strong></p><p><strong>ISO 9660</strong> (aka <strong>ECMA-119</strong>) is a read-only filesystem that is mainly used for optical media CD, DVD, BD, but may also reside on other storage devices like disk files, USB sticks or disk partitions. It is widely readable by many operating systems and by boot facilities of personal computers.</p><p>ISO 9660 describes directories and data files by very restricted filenames with no distinction of upper case and lower case. Its metadata do not comply to fundamental POSIX specifications.</p><p><strong>Rock Ridge</strong> is the name of a set of additional information which enhance an ISO 9660 filesystem so that it can represent a POSIX compliant filesystem with ownership, access permissions, symbolic links, and other attributes. Rock Ridge allows filenames of up to 255 bytes and paths of up to 1024 bytes.</p><p>xorrisofs produces Rock Ridge information by default. It is strongly discouraged to disable this feature.</p><p><strong>Joliet</strong> is the name of an additional directory tree which provides filenames up to 64 characters encoded as UTF-16. A Joliet tree is mainly interesting for reading the ISO image by operating systems of Microsoft Corporation. Production of this directory tree may be enabled by option -J.</p><p><strong>ISO 9660:1999</strong> is the name of an additional directory tree which provides longer filenames. It allows single file names to have up to 207 characters. It might be of use with some older computer system boot facilities which read neither Rock Ridge nor Joliet but need longer filenames nevertheless. Production of this directory tree may be enabled by option -iso-level 4.</p><p><strong>HFS+</strong> is the name of a filesystem which is normally used for writing and reading on hard disks and similar devices. It is possible to embed a HFS+ partition into the emerging ISO 9660 image and to mark it by Apple Partition Map entries. This interferes with options which copy data into the first 32 KiB of the ISO image, like -G or -isohybrid-mbr. See option -hfsplus.</p><p>The main purpose for having an embedded HFS+ partition is booting of certain models of Apple computers.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Inserting files into the ISO image:</strong></p><p><strong>xorrisofs</strong> deals with two kinds of file addresses:</p><p><strong>disk_path</strong> is a path to an object in the local filesystem tree.</p><p><strong>iso_rr_path</strong> is the Rock Ridge address of a file object in the ISO image. If no Rock Ridge information shall be stored in an emerging ISO, then the names will get mapped to ISO 9660 names of limited length and character set.</p><p>A program argument is handled as a <strong>pathspec</strong>, if it is not recognized as original mkisofs option or additional <strong>xorrisofs</strong> option. A pathspec depicts an input file object by a disk_path. If option -graft-points is not present, then the behavior depends on the file type of disk_path. Directories get merged with the /-directory of the ISO image. Files of other types get copied into the /-directory.</p><p>If -graft-points is present then each pathspec gets split at the first occurence of the =-character. The part before the = is taken as <strong>target</strong>, i.e. the iso_rr_path for the file object in the ISO image. The part after the first = is taken as <strong>source</strong>, i.e. the disk_path of the input object.</p><p>It is possible to make =-characters part of the iso_rr_path by preceding them with a &#92;-character. The same must be done for &#92;-characters which shall be part of the iso_rr_path.</p><p>If the source part of the pathspec leads to a directory, then all files underneath this directory get inserted into the image, too. It is possible to exclude particular files from being inserted by help of option -m.</p><p>In case that target already exists, the following rules apply: Directories and other files may overwrite existing non-directories. Directories get merged with existing directories. Non-directories may not overwrite existing directories.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Relation to program xorriso:</strong></p><p><strong>xorrisofs</strong> is actually a command mode of program <strong>xorriso</strong>, which gets entered either by xorriso command "-as mkisofs" or by starting the program by one of the names "xorrisofs", "mkisofs", "genisoimage", or "genisofs".</p><p>This command mode can be left by argument "--" which leads to generic xorriso command mode. See <strong>man xorriso</strong> for its description.</p><p>xorriso performs image reading and writing by help of libburn, which is mainly intended for optical drives, but also operates on all POSIX file types except directories.</p><p>The program messages call any image file a "drive". File types which are not supported for reading are reported as "blank". The reported free media space may be quite fictional.</p><p>Nevertheless <strong>xorrisofs</strong> does not operate directly on optical drives, but rather forces libburn to regard them as general device files. So for writing of sequential optical media (CD, DVD-R, DVD+R, BD-R) one will have to use a burn program. E.g the cdrecord emulation of xorriso. See EXAMPLES.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Image loading:</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The following options control loading of an existing ISO image for the purpose of preparing a suitable add-on session. If they are missing then a new image is composed from scratch.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-M</strong> disk_path</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the path from which to load the existing ISO image directory tree on which to base the upcomming directory tree as add-on session. The path must lead to a random-access readable file object. On GNU/Linux: regular data files or block device files.</p><p>A special kind of pseudo disk_path has the form "/dev/fd/"number. It depicts the open file descriptor with the given number, regardless whether the operating system supports this feature by file nodes in /dev/fd or not. E.g. /dev/fd/3 is file descriptor 3 which was opened by the program that later started xorriso.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-prev-session</strong> disk_path</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Alias of -M.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-dev</strong> disk_path</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Alias of -M.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-C</strong> last_session_start,next_writeable_address</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the 2 KiB block address last_session_start from where to read the ISO image out of the file given by option -M.</p><p>Separated by a comma, set the next_writeable_address to which the add-on session will finally be written. Decisive is actually the block address which the intended readers will have to use as superblock address on the intended medium.</p><p>Both values can be inquired from optical media by help of burn programs and cdrecord option -msinfo. xorriso itself can obtain it in its cdrecord emulation. Do not let it load the drive, but rather do this manually or by a program like dd which reads a few bytes. Only then it is sure that the device driver knows the true readable size of the medium.</p>
<pre>
  dd if=/dev/... count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1
</pre>

<pre>
  values=$(xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/... -msinfo)
</pre>

<pre>
  echo $values
</pre>
<p>Option -C may be used without option -M to create an ISO image from scratch and prepare it for being finally written to a block address other than 0. Parameter last_session_start must then be set to 0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-cdrecord-params</strong> last_session_start,next_writeable_address</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Alias of -C.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Settings for file insertion:</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-path-list</strong> disk_path</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Read pathspecs line-by-line from disk_file and insert the depicted file objects into the ISO image. If disk_path is "-" then read the pathspecs from standard input.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--quoted_path_list</strong> disk_path</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Like option -path-list but reading quoted words rather than plain lines. Whitespace outside of quotes will be discarded. On the other hand it is possible to represent pathspecs which contain newline characters.</p><p>The double quotation mark " and the single quotation mark ' can be used to enclose whitespace and make it part of pathspecs. Each mark type can enclose the marks of the other type. A trailing backslash nbsp;outside quotations or an open quotation cause the next input line to be appended.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-f</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Resolve symbolic links on disk rather than storing them as symbolic links in the ISO image.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-follow-links</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Alias of -f.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-graft-points</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable interpretation of input file pathspecs as combination of iso_rr_path and disk_path, separated by a =-character.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-m</strong> disk_pattern</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Exclude files from being inserted into the image. Silently ignored are those files of which the disk_path matches the given shell parser pattern. If no /-character is part of the pattern, then it gets matched against the leaf name of the disk file.</p><p>It is possible to give more than one -m option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-exclude</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Alias of -m.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-x</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Alias of -m.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-old-exclude</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Alias of -m.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-exclude-list</strong> disk_path</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Perform -m using each line out of file disk_path as argument disk_pattern.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-z</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable recognition and proper processing of zisofs compressed files as produced by program mkzftree. These files will get equipped with the necessary meta data so that a Linux kernel will recognize them and deliver their content in uncompressed form.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-transparent-compression</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Alias of -z.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-root</strong> iso_rr_path</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Insert all files under the given iso_rr_path. If option -graft-points is given, then iso_rr_path is prepended to each target part of a pathspec.</p><p>The default for -root is "/".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-old-root</strong> iso_rr_path</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable incremental insertion of files into the loaded image. The effective target and source addresses of given pathspecs get compared whether the target already exists in the ISO image and is still identical to the source on disk. Metadata in the ISO image will get adjusted, if they differ from those on disk. New files and files with changed content will get newly added. Target files which do not exist in any of the according pathspec sources will get removed from the ISO directory tree.</p><p>If the effective setting of -root differs from the iso_rr_path given with -old-root, then the files underneath the -old-root directory get cloned underneath the -root directory. Cloning happens before file comparison.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--old-root-no-ino</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Disable recording and use of disk inode numbers. If no disk inode numbers are recorded, then option -old-root will have to read disk file content and compare it with the MD5 checksum that is recorded in the ISO image.</p><p>With recorded disk inode numbers and with credible ctime and mtime, it is possible to detect potential changes in the content without actually reading it. A loophole remains if multiple different filesystems may get mounted at the same directory, like it is habit with /mnt. In this case one has to use option --old-root-devno or disable the inode number shortcut by --old-root-no-ino.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--old-root-devno</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable comparison of recorded device numbers together with recorded inode numbers. This works only with good old stable device numbers which get out of fashion, regrettably. If the hard disk has a different device number after each reboot, then this comparison will see all files as changed and thus prevent any incremental size saving.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--old-root-no-md5</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Disable recording and use of MD5 checksums for data file content. If neither checksums and nor disk inode numbers are recorded, then option -old-root will have to read ISO image file content when comparing it with disk file content.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Settings for image production:</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-o</strong> disk_path</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the output file address for the emerging ISO image. If the address exists as regular file, it will be truncated to length 0 when image production begins. It may not already exist as directory. If it does not exist yet then its parent directory must exist and a regular file will get created.</p><p>A special kind of pseudo disk_path has the form "/dev/fd/"number. It depicts the open file descriptor with the given number, regardless whether the operating system supports this feature by file nodes in /dev/fd or not. E.g. /dev/fd/4 is file descriptor 4 which was opened by the program that later started xorriso.</p><p>Default is standard output (/dev/fd/1) which may also be set by disk_path "-".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-output</strong> disk_path</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Alias of -o.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--stdio_sync</strong> "on"|"off"|number</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the number of bytes after which to force output to disk in order to keep the memory from being clogged with lots of pending data for slow devices. Default "on" is the same as "16m". Forced output can be disabled by "off".</p><p>xorriso uses an inner fifo buffer with default size 4 MiB. So forcing the operating system i/o cache to disk does not necessarily block the simultaneous production of more image content.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--emul-toc</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Write a second superblock with the first session into random-access files. If further sessions get appended and the first superblock gets updated, then the second superblock will not be overwritten. This allows to still mount the first session and to find the start blocks of the further sessions.</p><p>The price is 64 KiB extra space consumption. If -partition_offset is non-zero, then it is 128 KiB plus twice the partition setup.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--no-emul-toc</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Do not write a second superblock with the first session into random-access files.</p><p>This is the default.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--sort-weight</strong> weight_number iso_rr_path</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Attribute a LBA weight number to regular files. If iso_rr_path leads to a directory then all regular files underneath will get the weight_number.</p><p>The weight_number may range from -2147483648 to 2147483647. The higher it is, the lower will be the block address of the file data in the emerging ISO image. Currently the El Torito boot catalog has a hardcoded weight of 1 billion. Normally it should occupy the block with the lowest possible address. Data files get added or loaded with initial weight 0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--sort-weight-list</strong> disk_path</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Read pairs of weight number and iso_rr_path from a file of the local filesystem. Apply each pair like with --sort-weight.</p><p>Only the last --sort-weight-list or --sort-weight-patterns of a xorrisofs run gets into effect.</p><p>The weight number is read from the start of the line. The iso_rr_path part of an input line begins immediately after the first blank or tab character of the line.</p><p>Notes for the case that this feature is used within a sequence of generic xorriso commands (not an issue with a pure mkisofs emulation run):</p><p>The addressed files must already be in the ISO image model when you execute</p>
<pre>
  -as mkisofs --sort-weight-list disk_path --
</pre>
<p>Several such commands may be used to apply more than one weight file.</p><p>Data files which are loaded by -indev or -dev get a weight between 1 and 2 exp 28 = 268,435,456, depending on their block address. This shall keep them roughly in the same order if the write method of modifying is applied.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--sort-weight-patterns</strong> disk_path</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Like --sort-weight-list , but expanding the iso_rr_paths as shell parser patterns and applying --sort-weight to each matching file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-dir-mode</strong> mode</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the access permissions for all directories in the image to the given mode which is either an octal number beginning with "0" or a comma separated list of statements of the form [ugoa]*[+-=][rwxst]* . E.g. ug=rx,a-rwx</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-file-mode</strong> mode</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Like -dir-mode but for all regular data files in the image.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-pad</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Add 300 KiB to the end of the produced ISO image. This circumvents possible read errors from ISO images which have been written to CD media in TAO mode. The additional bytes are claimed as part of the ISO image if not --emul-toc is given.</p><p>Option -pad is the default.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-no-pad</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Disable padding of 300 KiB to the end of the produced ISO image. This is safe if the image is not meant to be written on CD or if it gets written to CD as only track in write mode SAO.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>--old-empty</strong></p>

</dl>
<p>The precondition for a bootable ISO image is to have in the ISO image the files of a boot loader. The boot facilities of computers get directed to such files, which usually execute further program files from the ISO image. <strong>xorrisofs</strong> can produce several kinds of boot block or boot record, which become part of the ISO image, and get interpreted by the according boot facility.</p><p>An <strong>El Torito</strong> boot record points the bootstrapping facility to a boot catalog with one or more boot images, which are binary program files stored in the ISO image. The content of the boot image files is not in the scope of El Torito.</p><p>xorriso composes the boot catalog according to the boot image files given and structured by options -b, -e, -el-torito-alt-boot, and --efi-boot. Often it contains only one entry.</p><p>El Torito gets interpreted by boot facilities PC-BIOS and EFI. Most bootable GNU/Linux CDs are equipped with ISOLINUX or GRUB boot images for PC-BIOS.</p><p><strong>xorrisofs</strong> supports the example options out of the ISOLINUX wiki, the options used in GRUB script grub-mkrescue, and the example in the FreeBSD AvgLiveCD wiki.</p><p>For CD booting via boot facilities other than PC-BIOS and EFI, and for booting from USB sticks or hard disks, see the next section about the Sytem Area.</p>

<p>The first 16 blocks of an ISO image are the System Area. It is reserved for system dependent boot software. This may be the boot facilities and partition tables of various hardware architectures.</p><p>A <strong>MBR</strong> (Master Boot Record) contains boot code and a partition table. It is read by PC-BIOS when booting from USB stick or hard disk, and by PowerPC CHRP or PReP when booting. An MBR partiton with type 0xee indicates the presence of GPT.</p><p>A <strong>GPT</strong> (GUID Partition Table) marks partitions in a more modern way. It is read by EFI when booting from USB stick or hard disk, and may be used for finding and mounting a HFS+ partition inside the ISO image.</p><p>An <strong>APM</strong> (Apple Partition Map) marks the HFS+ partition. It is read by Macs for booting and for mounting.</p><p>MBR, GPT and APM are combinable. APM occupies the first 8 bytes of MBR boot code. All three do not hamper El Torito booting from CDROM.</p><p><strong>xorrisofs</strong> supports further boot facilities: MIPS Big Endian (SGI), MIPS Little Endian (DEC), SUN SPARC. Those are mutually not combinable and also not combinable with MBR, GPT, or APM.</p>

If the block address is non-zero then it must be at least 16. Values larger than 16 are hardly of use. A non-zero partition offset causes two superblocks to be generated and two sets of directory trees. The image is then mountable from its absolute start as well as from the partition start.</p><p>The offset value of an ISO image gets preserved when a new session is added to a loaded image.

It should be divisible by 2048 in order to allow exact alignment. If it is too small to describe the image size by at most 1024 cylinders, then appropriate values of partition_hd_cyl are chosen with partition_sec_hd 32 or 63. If the image is larger than 8,422,686,720 bytes, then the cylinder size constraints cannot be fulfilled. They seem not overly important anyway.

<p>From man genisoimage: "Jigdo is a tool to help in the distribution of large files like CD and DVD images; see http://atterer.net/jigdo/ for more details. Debian CDs and DVD ISO images are published on the web in jigdo format to allow end users to download them more efficiently."</p><p>If the use of libjte was enabled at compile time of xorriso, then <strong>xorrisofs</strong> can produce a .jigdo and a .template file together with a single-session ISO image. If not, then Jigdo options will cause a FAILURE event, which normally leads to program abort.</p><p>One may determine the ability for Jigdo by:</p>
<pre>
  $ xorrisofs -version 2&gt;&1 | grep '^libjte' && echo YES
</pre>
<p>The .jigdo file contains checksums and symbolic file addresses. The .template file contains the compressed ISO image with reference tags instead of the content bytes of the listed files.</p><p>Input for this process are the normal arguments for a <strong>xorrisofs</strong> session with no image loaded, and a .md5 file which lists those data files which may be listed in the .jigdo file and externally referenced in the .template file. Each designated file is represented in the .md5 file by a single text line:</p><p>MD5 as 32 hex digits, 2 blanks, size as 12 decimal digits or blanks, 2 blanks, symbolic file address</p><p>The file address in an .md5 line has to bear the same basename as the disk_path of the file which it shall match. The directory path of the file address is decisive for To=From mapping, not for file recognition. After To=From mapping, the file address gets written into the .jigdo file. Jigdo restore tools will convert these addresses into really reachable data source addresses from which they can read.</p><p>If the list of jigdo parameters is not empty, then padding will be counted as part of the ISO image.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of examples:</strong> A simple image production run</p><p>Set ISO image paths by -graft-points</p><p>Perform multi-session runs</p><p>Let xorrisofs work underneath growisofs</p><p>Incremental backup of a few directory trees</p><p>Incremental backup with accumulated trees</p><p>Create bootable images for PC-BIOS</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>A simple image production run</strong> A prepared file tree in directory ./for_iso gets copied into the root directory of the ISO image. File permissions get set to read-only for everybody. Joliet attributes for Microsoft systems get added. The resulting image gets written as data file ./image.iso on disk.</p>
<pre>
  $ xorrisofs -r -J -o ./image.iso ./for_iso
</pre>

<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Set ISO image paths by -graft-points</strong> Without option -graft-points each given disk file is copied into the root directory of the ISO image, maintaining its name. If a directory is given, then its files and sub-directories are copied into the root directory, maintaining their names.</p>
<pre>
  $ xorrisofs ... /home/me/datafile /tmp/directory
</pre>
<p>yields in the ISO image root directory:</p>
<pre>
  /datafile
</pre>

<pre>
  /file_1_from_directory
</pre>

<pre>
  ...
</pre>

<pre>
  /file_N_from_directory
</pre>
<p>With option -graft-points it is possible to put files and directories to arbitrary paths in the ISO image.</p>
<pre>
  $ xorrisofs ... -graft-points /home/me/datafile /dir=/tmp/directory
</pre>
<p>yields in the ISO image root directory:</p>
<pre>
  /datafile
</pre>

<pre>
  /dir
</pre>
<p>Eventually needed parent directories in the image will be created automatically:</p>
<pre>
  /datafiles/file1=/home/me/datafile
</pre>
<p>yields in the ISO image:</p>
<pre>
  /datafiles/file1
</pre>
<p>The attributes of directory /datafiles get copied from /home/me on disk.</p><p>Normally one should avoid = and nbsp;characters in the ISO part of a pathspec. But if it must be, one may escape them:</p>
<pre>
  /with_&#92;=_and_&#92;&#92;/file=/tmp/directory/file
</pre>
<p>yields in the ISO image:</p>
<pre>
  /with_=_and_&#92;/file
</pre>

<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Perform multi-session runs</strong> This example works for multi-session media only: CD-R[W], DVD-R[W], DVD+R, BD-R. Add cdrskin option --grow_overwriteable_iso to all -as cdrecord runs in order to enable multi-session emulation on overwriteable media.</p><p>The first session is written like this:</p>

<p>Follow-up sessions are written like this:</p>
<pre>
  $ dd if=/dev/sr0 count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1
</pre>

<pre>
  $ m=$(xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -msinfo)
</pre>

<pre>

</pre>
<p>Always eject the drive tray between sessions. The old sessions get read via /dev/sr0. Its device driver might not be aware of the changed content before it loads the medium again. In this case the previous session would not be loaded and the new session would contain only the newly added files.</p><p>For the same reason do not let xorriso -as cdrecord load the medium, but rather do this manually or by a program that reads from /dev/sr0.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Let xorrisofs work underneath growisofs</strong> growisofs expects an ISO formatter program which understands options -C and -M. A variable is defined to override the hardcoded default name.</p>
<pre>
  $ export MKISOFS="xorrisofs"
</pre>

<pre>
  $ growisofs -Z /dev/dvd /some/files
</pre>

<pre>
  $ growisofs -M /dev/dvd /more/files
</pre>
<p>If no "xorrisofs" is available on your system, then you will have to create a link pointing to the xorriso binary and tell growisofs to use it. E.g. by:</p>
<pre>
  $ ln -s $(which xorriso) "$HOME/xorrisofs"
</pre>

<pre>
  $ export MKISOFS="$HOME/xorrisofs"
</pre>
<p>One may quit mkisofs emulation by argument "--" and make use of all xorriso commands. growisofs dislikes options which start with "-o" but -outdev must be set to "-". So use "outdev" instead:</p>
<pre>
  $ growisofs -Z /dev/dvd --for_backup -- &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
              outdev - -update_r /my/files /files
</pre>

<pre>
  $ growisofs -M /dev/dvd --for_backup -- &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
              outdev - -update_r /my/files /files
</pre>
<p>Note that --for_backup is given in the mkisofs emulation. To preserve the recorded extra data it must already be in effect, when the emulation loads the image.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Incremental backup of a few directory trees</strong> This changes the directory trees /open_source_project and /personal_mail in the ISO image so that they become exact copies of their disk counterparts. ISO file objects get created, deleted or get their attributes adjusted accordingly.</p><p>ACL, xattr, hard links and MD5 checksums will be recorded. It is expected that inode numbers in the disk filesystem are persistent over cycles of mounting and booting. Files with names matching *.o or *.swp get excluded explicitly.</p><p>To be used several times on the same medium, whenever an update of the two disk trees to the medium is desired. Begin with a blank medium and update it until he run fails gracefully due to lack of remaining space on the old one.</p><p>Do not let xorriso -as cdrecord load the medium, but rather do this manually or by a program that reads from /dev/sr0.</p>
<pre>
  $ dd if=/dev/sr0 count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1
</pre>

<pre>
  $ msinfo=$(xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -msinfo)
</pre>

<pre>
  $ load_opts=
</pre>

<pre>
  $ test -n "$msinfo" && load_opts="-M /dev/sr0 -C $msinfo"
</pre>

<pre>
  $ xorrisofs $load_opts -o - --for_backup -m '*.o' -m '*.swp' &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
    -V PROJ_MAIL_"$(date '+%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S')" -graft-points &#92;
</pre>

<pre>

</pre>

<pre>

</pre>

<pre>
    | xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -v -multi -waiti -eject -
</pre>
<p>This makes sense if the full backup leaves substantial remaining capacity on media and if the expected changes are much smaller than the full backup.</p><p><strong>Better do not use your youngest backup for -old-root</strong>. Have at least two media which you use alternatingly. So only older backups get endangered by the new write operation, while the newest backup is stored safely on a different medium.</p><p>Always have a blank medium ready to perform a full backup in case the update attempt fails due to insufficient remaining capacity. This failure will not spoil the old medium, of course.</p><p>If inode numbers on disk are not persistent, then use option --old-root-no-ino . In this case an update run will compare recorded MD5 sums against the current file content on hard disk.</p><p>With <strong>mount</strong> option <strong>-o "sbsector="</strong> on GNU/Linux resp. <strong>-s</strong> on FreeBSD it is possible to access the session trees which represent the older backup versions. With CD media, GNU/Linux mount accepts session numbers directly by its option "session=".</p><p>Multi-session media and most overwriteable media written by xorriso can tell the sbsectors of their sessions by xorriso option -toc:</p>
<pre>
  $ xorriso -dev /dev/sr0 -toc
</pre>
<p>xorriso can print the matching mount command for a session number:</p>
<pre>
  $ xorriso -mount_cmd /dev/sr0 session 12 /mnt
</pre>
<p>or for a volume id that matches a search expression:</p>
<pre>
  $ xorriso -mount_cmd /dev/sr0 volid '*2008_12_05*' /mnt
</pre>
<p>Both yield on standard output something like:</p>
<pre>
  mount -t iso9660 -o nodev,noexec,nosuid,ro,sbsector=1460256 '/dev/sr0' '/mnt'
</pre>
<p>The superuser may let xorriso execute the mount command directly:</p>
<pre>
  # osirrox -mount /dev/sr0 "volid" '*2008_12_05*' /mnt
</pre>

<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Incremental backup with accumulated trees</strong> Solaris does not offer the option to mount older sessions. In order to keep them accessible, one may map all files to a file tree under a session directory and accumulate those directories from session to session. The -root tree is cloned from the -old-root tree before it gets compared with the appropriate trees on disk.</p><p>This demands to know the previously used session directory name.</p><p>With the first session:</p>
<pre>
  $ xorrisofs -root /session1 &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
    -o - --for_backup -m '*.o' -m '*.swp' &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
    -V PROJ_MAIL_"$(date '+%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S')" -graft-points &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
    /projects=/home/thomas/projects &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
    /personal_mail=/home/thomas/personal_mail &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
    | xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -v blank=as_needed &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
              -multi -waiti -eject -
</pre>
<p>With the second session, option -old-root refers to /session1 and the new -root is /session2.</p><p>Do not let xorriso -as cdrecord load the medium, but rather do this manually or by a program that reads from /dev/sr0.</p>
<pre>
  $ dd if=/dev/sr0 count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1
</pre>

<pre>
  $ msinfo=$(xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -msinfo)
</pre>

<pre>
  $ load_opts=
</pre>

<pre>
  $ test -n "$msinfo" && load_opts="-M /dev/sr0 -C $msinfo"
</pre>

<pre>
  $ xorrisofs $load_opts -root /session2 -old-root /session1 &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
    -o - --for_backup -m '*.o' -m '*.swp' &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
    -V PROJ_MAIL_"$(date '+%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S')" -graft-points &#92;

</pre>

<pre>
    | xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -v -multi -waiti -eject -
</pre>
<p>With the third session, option -old-root refers to /session2. The new -root is /session3. And so on.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Create bootable images for PC-BIOS</strong> The ISOLINUX wiki prescribes to create on disk a directory ./CD_root and to copy all desired files underneath that directory. Especially file isolinux.bin shall be copied to ./CD_root/isolinux/isolinux.bin . This is the boot image file.</p><p>The prescribed mkisofs options can be used unchanged with <strong>xorrisofs</strong>:</p>
<pre>
  $ xorrisofs -o output.iso &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
      -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
      -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
      ./CD_root
</pre>
<p>Put it on CD by a burn program. E.g.:</p>
<pre>
  $ xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=as_needed output.iso
</pre>
<p>The image from above example will boot from CD, DVD or BD, but not from USB stick or other hard-disk-like devices. This can be done by help of an isohybrid MBR. Syslinux provides matching template files as isohdp[fp]x*.bin . E.g. /usr/lib/syslinux/isohdpfx.bin .</p><p>If a few hundred KB of size do not matter, then option -partition_offset can be used to create a partition table where partition 1 starts not at block 0. This facilitates later manipulations of the USB stick by tools for partitioning and formatting.</p><p>The image from the following example will be prepared for booting via MBR and its first parttion will start at hard disk block 64.</p><p>It will also boot from optical media.</p>
<pre>
  $ xorrisofs -o output.iso &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
      -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
      -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
      -isohybrid-mbr /usr/lib/syslinux/isohdpfx.bin &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
      -partition_offset 16 &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
      ./CD_root
</pre>
<p>Become superuser and copy the image to the unpartitioned base device file of the USB stick. On GNU/Linux this is e.g. /dev/sdb, not /dev/sdb1.</p><p>CAUTION: This will overwrite any partitioning on the USB stick and make remaining data unaccessible.</p><p>So first make sure you got the correct address of the intended device. E.g. by reading 100 MiB data from it and watching it blinking:</p>
<pre>
  # dd bs=2K if=/dev/sdb count=50K &gt;/dev/null
</pre>
<p>Now copy the image onto it</p>
<pre>
  # dd bs=2K if=output.iso of=/dev/sdb
</pre>
