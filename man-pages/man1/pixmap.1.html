      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <em>pixmap</em> program is a tool for creating or editing rectangular images made up of colored pixels, i.e., pixmaps. Pixmaps are intensively used in X to define window backgrounds, icon images, etc.</p><p>The <em>pixmap</em> program can have two different interfaces, a Athena widgets version and a Motif widgets version.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">USAGE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><em>Pixmap</em> displays grid in which each square represents a single pixel in the picture being edited.  Squares can be set, cleared, or inverted (this last operation will be detailed later) directly with the buttons on the pointer and a menu of higher level operations such as draw line and fill circle is provided to the side of the grid. Another menu on the top of the window allows files operations (Load, Save, ...), edit operations (Cut/Copy/Paste, attributes of pixmap editing, ...) and colors operations (drawing color, attributes of colors, ...). <em>Pixmap</em> uses a Pixmap widget to represent the pixmap image.</p><p>Pixmaps are stored as a C string array variable suitable for including in applications, using the format defined by Arnaud Le Hors in his Xpm library (refer to Xpm manual for format description). This format allows pixmaps to be used indistinctly on monochrome, grey scale or color displays.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">MENU COMMANDS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>To make defining shapes easier, <em>pixmap</em> provides several commands for drawing and manipulating the pixmap edited, and commands for file management.</p><p>Commands are layed in a vertical bar at the left of the Pixmap widget and in a menu bar at the top of the window. Most of the drawing commands are located in the left bar, where as file management and other general commands are located in the top menu bar.</p><p>In the left bar, some commands are represented by icons. They are, from left to right and up to down, <em>Flip horizontally</em>, <em>Up</em>, <em>Flip vertically</em>, <em>Left</em>, <em>Fold</em>, <em>Right</em>, <em>Rotate</em> right (counterclock), <em>Down</em>, <em>Rotate left</em> (clockwise).</p><p>Some commands are also available directly through the keyboard when the mouse cursor is located on the Pixmap widget. They will be mentionned as an accelerator in the following description.</p><p>LEFT BAR COMMANDS</p>

Small circles may not look very round because of the size of the pixmap and the limits of having to work with discrete pixels. This command can be considered as a mode.  This command has no accelerator.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>Filled Circle</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>

<p>Lines where only appears one or the other type of a widget (like Dialog| or |CascadeButtonGadget) mean that the widget doesn't exist in one or the other version. In the case of dialogs in the Motif version, the widgets are created by means of convenient routines which assign the name of the widget depending on the name of the dialog. By the way, we can't provide with a list of types and names for the substructure of dialog widgets in the Motif version. However, these shouldn't be often modified.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>If you move the pointer too fast while holding a pointer button down, some pixels may be missed.  This is caused by limitations in how frequently the X server can sample the pointer location.</p><p>Loading a pixmap file where the same color is used more than once with different symbols and descriptions, and writing it will loose information concerning the color used more than once. The pixmap file plaid given as an example in this man won't be saved that way by <em>pixmap</em>.</p><p>Accelerators to menu operations don't seem to work with Athena version.</p><p>In the Motif version, the <em>Filename...</em> and <em>Resize...</em> commands open their respective dialog window in a strange mode. The user has to voluntary (;-) give the focus to the text widget inside to be able to change its content.</p>
