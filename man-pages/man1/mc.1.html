      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">Overview</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The screen of the Midnight Commander is divided into four parts. Almost all of the screen space is taken up by two directory panels. By default, the second line from the bottom of the screen is the shell command line, and the bottom line shows the function key labels. The topmost line is the menu bar line. The menu bar line may not be visible, but appears if you click the topmost line with the mouse or press the F9 key.</p><p>The Midnight Commander provides a view of two directories at the same time. One of the panels is the current panel (a selection bar is in the current panel). Almost all operations take place on the current panel. Some file operations like Rename and Copy by default use the directory of the unselected panel as a destination (don't worry, they always ask you for confirmation first). For more information, see the sections on the Directory Panels, the Left and Right Menus and the File Menu.</p><p>You can execute system commands from the Midnight Commander by simply typing them. Everything you type will appear on the shell command line, and when you press Enter the Midnight Commander will execute the command line you typed; read the Shell Command Line and Input Line Keys sections to learn more about the command line.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">Mouse Support</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The Midnight Commander comes with mouse support.  It is activated whenever you are running on an <a href="../man1/xterm.1.html"><strong>xterm</strong>(1)</a></strong> terminal (it even works if you take a telnet, ssh or rlogin connection to another machine from the xterm) or if you are running on a Linux console and have the <strong>gpm</strong> mouse server running.</p><p>When you left click on a file in the directory panels, that file is selected; if you click with the right button, the file is marked (or unmarked, depending on the previous state).</p><p>Double-clicking on a file will try to execute the command if it is an executable program; and if the extension file has a program specified for the file's extension, the specified program is executed.</p><p>Also, it is possible to execute the commands assigned to the function key labels by clicking on them.</p><p>The default auto repeat rate for the mouse buttons is 400 milliseconds. This may be changed to other values by editing the ~/.config/mc/ini file and changing the <em>mouse_repeat_rate</em> parameter.</p><p>If you are running the Midnight Commander with the mouse support, you can get the default mouse behavior (cutting and pasting text) by holding down the Shift key.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">Keys</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Some commands in the Midnight Commander involve the use of the <em>Control</em> (sometimes labeled CTRL or CTL) and the <em>Meta</em> (sometimes labeled ALT or even Compose) keys. In this manual we will use the following abbreviations:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>C-&lt;chr&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>means hold the Control key while typing the character &lt;chr&gt;. Thus C-f would be: hold the Control key and type f.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Alt-&lt;chr&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>means hold the Meta or Alt key down while typing &lt;chr&gt;. If there is no Meta or Alt key, type <em>ESC</em>, release it, then type the character &lt;chr&gt;.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>S-&lt;chr&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>means hold the Shift key down while typing &lt;chr&gt;.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>All input lines in the Midnight Commander use an approximation to the GNU Emacs editor's key bindings (default).</p><p>You may redefine key bindings. See <em>redefine hotkey bindings</em></p><p>for more info. All other key bindings (described in this manual) relative to default behavior.</p><p>There are many sections which tell about the keys. The following are the most important.</p><p>The File Menu section documents the keyboard shortcuts for the commands appearing in the File menu. This section includes the function keys. Most of these commands perform some action, usually on the selected file or the tagged files.</p><p>The Directory Panels section documents the keys which select a file or tag files as a target for a later action (the action is usually one from the file menu).</p><p>The Shell Command Line section list the keys which are used for entering and editing command lines. Most of these copy file names and such from the directory panels to the command line (to avoid excessive typing) or access the command line history.</p><p>Input Line Keys are used for editing input lines. This means both the command line and the input lines in the query dialogs.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">  Redefine hotkey bindings</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Hotkey bindings may be read from external file (keymap-file). Initially, Mignight Commander creates key bindings using keymap defined in the source code. Then, two files <strong>/usr/share/mc/mc.keymap</strong> and <strong>/etc/mc/mc.keymap</strong> are loaded always, sequentially reassigned key bindings defined earlier. User-defined keymap-file is searched on the following algorithm (to the first one found):</p><ul>
<li><p>1) command line option <strong>-K &lt;keymap&gt;</strong> or <strong>--keymap=&lt;keymap&gt;</strong></p><p>2) Environment variable <strong>MC_KEYMAP</strong></p><p>3) Parameter <strong>keymap</strong> in section <strong>[Midnight-Commander]</strong> of config file.</p><p>4) File <strong>~/.config/mc/mc.keymap</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>Command line option, environment variable and parameter in config file may contain the absolute path to the keymap-file (with the extension .keymap or without it). Search of keymap-file will occur in (to the first one found):</p><ul>
<li><p>1) <strong>~/.config/mc</strong></p><p>2) <strong>/etc/mc/</strong></p><p>3) <strong>/usr/share/mc/</strong></p></li>

    <p>if there is some text in the command line (the one at the bottom of the panels), then that command is executed.

Finally, if the extension of the selected file name matches one of the extensions in the extensions file then the corresponding command is executed.</p>

The full directory view shows the file name, the size of the file and the modification time.</p><p>The brief view shows only the file name and it has two columns (therefore showing twice as many files as other views). The long view is similar to the output of <strong>ls -l</strong> command. The long view takes the whole screen width.</p><p>If you choose the "User" display format, then you have to specify the display format.</p><p>The user display format must start with a panel size specifier.  This may be "half" or "full", and they specify a half screen panel and a full screen panel respectively.</p><p>After the panel size, you may specify the two columns mode on the panel, this is done by adding the number "2" to the user format string.</p><p>After this you add the name of the fields with an optional size specifier.  This are the available fields you may display:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>

  <dd>
    <p>is an alternative form of the <strong>size</strong> format. It displays the size of the files and for directories it just shows SUB-DIR or UP--DIR.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>type</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>displays a one character wide type field.  This character is similar to what is displayed by ls with the -F flag - <strong>*</strong> for executable files, <strong>/</strong> for directories, <strong>@</strong> for links, <strong>=</strong> for sockets, <strong>-</strong> for character devices, <strong>+</strong> for block devices, <strong>|</strong> for pipes, <strong>~</strong> for symbolic links to directories and <strong>!</strong> for stale symlinks (links that point nowhere).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>mark</strong></p>
  </dt>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>inode</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>the inode of the file.</p>

<p>Also you can use following keywords to define the panel layout:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>space</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>a space in the display format.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>|</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>add a vertical line to the display format.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>To force one field to a fixed size (a size specifier), you just add <strong>:</strong> followed by the number of characters you want the field to have.  If the number is followed by the symbol <strong>+</strong>, then the size specifies the minimal field size - if the program finds out that there is more space on the screen, it will then expand that field.</p><p>For example, the <strong>Full</strong> display corresponds to this format:</p><p>half type name | size | mtime</p><p>And the <strong>Long</strong> display corresponds to this format:</p><p>full perm space nlink space owner space group space size space mtime space name</p><p>This is a nice user display format:</p><p>half name | size:7 | type mode:3</p><p>Panels may also be set to the following modes:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Info</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The info view display information related to the currently selected file and if possible information about the current file system.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Tree</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The tree view is quite similar to the directory tree feature. See the section about it for more information.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Quick View</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>In this mode, the panel will switch to a reduced viewer that displays the contents of the currently selected file, if you select the panel (with the tab key or the mouse), you will have access to the usual viewer commands.</p>

By default this invokes the Internal File Viewer but if the option "Use internal view" is off, it invokes an external file viewer specified by the <strong>VIEWER</strong> environment variable.  If <strong>VIEWER</strong> is undefined, the <strong>PAGER</strong> environment variable is tried.  If <strong>PAGER</strong> is also undefined, the "view" command is invoked.  If you use F13 instead, the viewer will be invoked without doing any formatting or preprocessing to the file.</p><p>See parameters for external viewer for explain how you may specify an extended command line options for external viewers.</p><p><strong>Filtered View (Alt-!)</strong></p><p>This command prompts for a command and its arguments (the argument defaults to the currently selected file name), the output from such command is shown in the internal file viewer.</p><p><strong>Edit (F4, F14)</strong></p><p>Press F4 to edit the highlighted file.  Press F14 (usually F14) to start the editor with a new, empty file. Currently they invoke the <strong>vi</strong> editor, or the editor specified in the <strong>EDITOR</strong> environment variable, or the Internal File Editor if the use_internal_edit option is on.</p><p>See parameters for external editor for explain how you may specify an extended command line options for external editors.</p><p><strong>Copy (F5, F15)</strong></p><p>Press F5 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the directory/filename you specify in the input dialog. The destination defaults to the directory in the non-selected panel. Space for destination file may be preallocated relative to preallocate_space configure option. During this process, you can press C-c or ESC to abort the operation. For details about source mask (which will be usually either * or ^&#92;(.*&#92;)$ depending on setting of Use shell patterns) and possible wildcards in the destination see Mask copy/rename.</p><p>F15 (usually F15) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the selected panel. It always operates on the selected file, regardless of any tagged files.</p><p>On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by clicking on the background button (or pressing Alt-b in the dialog box).  The Background Jobs is used to control the background process.</p><p><strong>Link (C-x l)</strong></p><p>Create a hard link to the current file.</p><p><strong>Absolute symlink (C-x s)</strong></p><p>Create a absolute symbolic link to the current file.</p><p><strong>Relative symLink (C-x v)</strong></p><p>Create a relative symbolic link to the current file.</p><p>To those of you who don't know what links are: creating a link to a file is a bit like copying the file, but both the source filename and the destination filename represent the same file image. For example, if you edit one of these files, all changes you make will appear in both files. Some people call links aliases or shortcuts.</p><p>A hard link appears as a real file. After making it, there is no way of telling which one is the original and which is the link. If you delete either one of them the other one is still intact. It is very difficult to notice that the files represent the same image. Use hard links when you don't even want to know.</p><p>A symbolic link is a reference to the name of the original file. If the original file is deleted the symbolic link is useless. It is quite easy to notice that the files represent the same image. The Midnight Commander shows an "@"-sign in front of the file name if it is a symbolic link to somewhere (except to directory, where it shows a tilde (~)). The original file which the link points to is shown on mini-status line if the <em>Show mini-status</em> option is enabled. Use symbolic links when you want to avoid the confusion that can be caused by hard links.</p><p>When you press "C-x s" Midnight Commander will automatically fill in the complete path+filename of the original file and suggest a name for the link. You can change either one.</p><p>Sometimes you may want to change the absolute path of the original into a relative path. An absolute path starts from the root directory:</p><p><em>/home/frodo/mc/mc -&gt; /home/frodo/new/mc</em></p><p>A relative link describes the original file's location starting from the location of the link itself:</p><p><em>/home/frodo/mc/mc -&gt; ../new/mc</em></p><p>You can force Midnight Commander to suggest a relative path by pressing "C-x v" instead of "C-x s".</p><p><strong>Rename/Move (F6, F16)</strong></p><p>Press F6 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the directory/filename you specify in the input dialog.  The destination defaults to the directory in the non-selected panel. For more details look at Copy (F5) operation above, most of the things are quite similar.</p><p>F16 (usually F16) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the selected panel. It always operates on the selected file, regardless of any tagged files.</p><p>On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by clicking on the background button (or pressing Alt-b in the dialog box).  The Background Jobs is used to control the background process.</p><p><strong>Mkdir (F7)</strong></p><p>Pop up an input dialog and creates the directory specified.</p><p><strong>Delete (F8)</strong></p><p>Delete the currently selected file or the tagged files in the currently selected panel. During the process, you can press C-c or ESC to abort the operation.</p><p><strong>Quick cd (Alt-c)</strong> Use the quick cd command if you have full command line and want to cd somewhere.</p><p><strong>Select group (+)</strong></p><p>This is used to select (tag) a group of files. The Midnight Commander will prompt for a selection options. When <em>Files only</em> checkbox is on, only files will be selected.  If <em>Files only</em> is off, as files as directories will be selected. When <em>Shell Patterns</em> checkbox is on, the regular expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for zero or more characters and ?  standing for one character). If <em>Shell Patterns</em> is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular expressions (see ed (1)). When <em>Case sensitive</em> checkbox is on, the selection will be case sensitive characters. If <em>Case sensitive</em> is off, the case will be ignored.</p><p><strong>Unselect group (&#92;&#92;)</strong></p><p>Used to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of the <em>Select group</em> command.</p><p><strong>Quit (F10, Shift-F10)</strong></p><p>Terminate the Midnight Commander.  Shift-F10 is used when you want to quit and you are using the shell wrapper.  Shift-F10 will not take you to the last directory you visited with the Midnight Commander, instead it will stay at the directory where you started the Midnight Commander.</p>

The real directory tree command is available from Commands menu. The other way is to select tree view from the Left or Right menu.</p><p>To get rid of long delays the Midnight Commander creates the tree figure by scanning only a small subset of all the directories. If the directory which you want to see is missing, move to its parent directory and press C-r (or F2).</p><p>You can use the following keys:</p><p>General movement keys are accepted.</p><p><strong>Enter.</strong> In the directory tree, exits the directory tree and changes to this directory in the current panel. In the tree view, changes to this directory in the other panel and stays in tree view mode in the current panel.</p><p><strong>C-r, F2 (Rescan).</strong> Rescan this directory. Use this when the tree figure is out of date: it is missing subdirectories or shows some subdirectories which don't exist any more.</p><p><strong>F3 (Forget).</strong> Delete this directory from the tree figure. Use this to remove clutter from the figure. If you want the directory back to the tree figure press F2 in its parent directory.</p><p><strong>F4 (Static/Dynamic).</strong> Toggle between the dynamic navigation mode (default) and the static navigation mode.</p><p>In the static navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to select a directory. All known directories are shown.</p><p>In the dynamic navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to select a sibling directory, the Left key to move to the parent directory, and the Right key to move to a child directory.

The Chdir button will change to the directory of the currently selected file. The Again button will ask for the parameters for a new search. The Quit button quits the search operation. The Panelize button will place the found files to the current directory panel so that you can do additional operations on them (view, copy, move, delete and so on). After panelizing you can press C-r to return to the normal file listing.</p><p>The 'Enable ignore directories' checkbox and input field below it allow to set up the list of directories that should be skip during the search files (for example, you may want to avoid searches on a CD-ROM or on a NFS directory that is mounted across a slow link). List components must be separated with a colon, here is an example:</p>
<pre>
/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The user menu is a menu of useful actions that can be customized by the user. When you access the user menu, the file .mc.menu from the current directory is used if it exists, but only if it is owned by user or root and is not world-writable. If no such file found, ~/.config/mc/menu is tried in the same way, and otherwise mc uses the default system-wide menu /usr/share/mc/mc.menu.</p><p>The format of the menu file is very simple. Lines that start with anything but space or tab are considered entries for the menu (in order to be able to use it like a hot key, the first character should be a letter). All the lines that start with a space or a tab are the commands that will be executed when the entry is selected.</p><p>When an option is selected all the command lines of the option are copied to a temporary file in the temporary directory (usually /usr/tmp) and then that file is executed. This allows the user to put normal shell constructs in the menus. Also simple macro substitution takes place before executing the menu code. For more information, see macro substitution.</p><p>Here is a sample mc.menu file:</p>
<pre>
A	Dump the currently selected file
	od -c %f

B	Edit a bug report and send it to root
	I=`mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:-/tmp}/mail.XXXXXX` || exit 1
	vi $I
	mail -s "Midnight Commander bug" root &lt; $I
	rm -f $I

M	Read mail
	emacs -f rmail

N	Read Usenet news
	emacs -f gnus

H	Call the info hypertext browser
	info

J	Copy current directory to other panel recursively
	tar cf - . | (cd %D && tar xvpf -)

K	Make a release of the current subdirectory
	echo -n "Name of distribution file: "
	read tar
	ln -s %d `dirname %d`/$tar

</pre>
<p><strong>Default Conditions</strong></p><p>Each menu entry may be preceded by a condition. The condition must start from the first column with a '=' character. If the condition is true, the menu entry will be the default entry.</p>
<pre>
Condition syntax: 	= &lt;sub-cond&gt;
  or:			= &lt;sub-cond&gt; | &lt;sub-cond&gt; ...
  or:			= &lt;sub-cond&gt; & &lt;sub-cond&gt; ...

Sub-condition is one of following:

  y &lt;pattern&gt;		syntax of current file matching pattern?
			(for edit menu only)
  f &lt;pattern&gt;		current file matching pattern?
  F &lt;pattern&gt;		other file matching pattern?
  d &lt;pattern&gt;		current directory matching pattern?
  D &lt;pattern&gt;		other directory matching pattern?
  t &lt;type&gt;		current file of type?
  T &lt;type&gt;		other file of type?
  x &lt;filename&gt;		is it executable filename?
  ! &lt;sub-cond&gt;		negate the result of sub-condition
</pre>
<p>Pattern is a normal shell pattern or a regular expression, according to the shell patterns option. You can override the global value of the shell patterns option by writing "shell_patterns=x" on the first line of the menu file (where "x" is either 0 or 1).</p><p>Type is one or more of the following characters:</p>
<pre>
  n	not a directory
  r	regular file
  d	directory
  l	link
  c	character device
  b	block device
  f	FIFO (pipe)
  s	socket
  x	executable file
  t	tagged
</pre>
<p>For example 'rlf' means either regular file, link or fifo. The 't' type is a little special because it acts on the panel instead of the file. The condition '=t t' is true if there are tagged files in the current panel and false if not.</p><p>If the condition starts with '=?' instead of '=' a debug trace will be shown whenever the value of the condition is calculated.</p><p>The conditions are calculated from left to right. This means</p>
<pre>
	= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
</pre>
<p>is calculated as</p>
<pre>
	( (f *.tar.gz) | (f *.tgz) ) & (t n)
</pre>
<p>Here is a sample of the use of conditions:</p>
<pre>
= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
L	List the contents of a compressed tar-archive
	gzip -cd %f | tar xvf -
</pre>
<p><strong>Addition Conditions</strong></p><p>If the condition begins with '+' (or '+?') instead of '=' (or '=?') it is an addition condition. If the condition is true the menu entry will be included in the menu. If the condition is false the menu entry will not be included in the menu.</p><p>You can combine default and addition conditions by starting condition with '+=' or '=+' (or '+=?' or '=+?' if you want debug trace). If you want to use two different conditions, one for adding and another for defaulting, you can precede a menu entry with two condition lines, one starting with '+' and another starting with '='.</p><p>Comments are started with '#'. The additional comment lines must start with '#', space or tab.</p>

<p>The options in this dialog are divided into several groups: "File operation options", "Esc key mode", "Pause after run" and "Other options".</p><p><strong>File operation options</strong></p><p><em>Verbose operation.</em> This toggles whether the file Copy, Rename and Delete operations are verbose (i.e., display a dialog box for each operation). If you have a slow terminal, you may wish to disable the verbose operation. It is automatically turned off if the speed of your terminal is less than 9600 bps.</p><p><em>Compute totals.</em> If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander computes total byte sizes and total number of files prior to any Copy, Rename and Delete operations. This will provide you with a more accurate progress bar at the expense of some speed. This option has no effect, if <em>Verbose operation</em> is disabled.</p><p><em>Classic progressbar.</em> If this option is enabled, the progressbar of Copy/Move/Delete operations is always grown form left to right. If disabled, the growing direction of progressbar follows to direction of Copy/Move/Delete operation: from left panel to right one and vice versa. Enabled by default.</p><p><em>Mkdir autoname.</em> When you press F7 to create a new directory, the input line in popup dialog will be filled by name of current file or directory in active panel. Disabled by default.</p><p><em>Preallocate space.</em> Preallocate space for whole target file, if possible, before copy operation. Disabled by default.</p><p><strong>Esc key mode.</strong></p><p>By default the Midnight Commander treats the ESC key as a key prefix. Therefore, you should press Esc code twice to exit a dialog. But there is a possibility to use a single press of ESC key for that action.</p><p><em>Single press.</em> By default this option is disabled. If you'll enable it, the ESC key will act as a prefix key for set up time interval (see <em>Timeout</em> option below), and if no extra keys have arrived, then the ESC key is interpreted as a cancel key (ESC ESC).</p><p><em>Timeout.</em> This options is used to setup the time interval (in microseconds) for single press of ESC key. By default, this inrerval is one second (1000000 microseconds). Also the timeout can be set via KEYBOARD_KEY_TIMEOUT_US environment variable (also in microseconds), which has higher priority than Timeout option value.</p><p><strong>Pause after run</strong></p><p>After executing your commands, the Midnight Commander can pause, so that you can examine the output of the command.  There are three possible settings for this variable:</p><p><em>Never.</em> Means that you do not want to see the output of your command.  If you are using the Linux or FreeBSD console or an xterm, you will be able to see the output of the command by typing C-o.</p><p><em>On dumb terminals.</em> You will get the pause message on terminals that are not capable of showing the output of the last command executed (any terminal that is not an xterm or the Linux console).</p><p><em>Always.</em> The program will pause after executing all of your commands.</p><p><strong>Other options</strong></p><p><em>Use internal editor.</em> If this option is enabled, the built-in file editor is used to edit files. If the option is disabled, the editor specified in the <strong>EDITOR</strong> environment variable is used. If no editor is specified, <strong>vi</strong> is used.  See the section on the internal file editor.</p><p><em>Use internal viewer.</em> If this option is enabled, the built-in file viewer is used to view files. If the option is disabled, the pager specified in the <strong>PAGER</strong> environment variable is used. If no pager is specified, the <strong>view</strong> command is used.  See the section on the internal file viewer.</p><p><em>Ask new file name.</em> If this option is enabled, file name is asked before open new file in editor.</p><p><em>Auto menus.</em> If this option is enabled, the user menu will be invoked at startup. Useful for building menus for non-unixers.</p><p><em>Drop down menus.</em> When this option is enabled, the pull down menus will be activated as soon as you press the F9 key. Otherwise, you will only get the menu title, and you will have to activate the menu either with the arrow keys or with the hotkeys. It is recommended if you are using hotkeys.</p><p><em>Shell Patterns.</em> By default the Select, Unselect and Filter commands will use shell-like regular expressions. The following conversions are performed to achieve this: the '*' is replaced by '.*' (zero or more characters); the '?' is replaced by '.' (exactly one character) and '.' by the literal dot. If the option is disabled, then the regular expressions are the ones described in ed(1).</p><p><em>Complete: show all.</em> By default the Midnight Commander pops up all possible completions if the completion is ambiguous only when you press <strong>Alt-Tab</strong> for the second time.  For the first time, it just completes as much as possible and beeps in the case of ambiguity.  Enable this option if you want to see all possible completions even after pressing <strong>Alt-Tab</strong> the first time.</p><p><em>Rotating dash.</em> If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander shows a rotating dash in the upper right corner as a work in progress indicator.</p><p><em>Cd follows links.</em> This option, if set, causes the Midnight Commander to follow the logical chain of directories when changing current directory either in the panels, or using the cd command. This is the default behavior of bash. When unset, the Midnight Commander follows the real directory structure, so cd .. if you've entered that directory through a link will move you to the current directory's real parent and not to the directory where the link was present.</p><p><em>Safe delete.</em> If this option is enabled, deleting files and directory hotlist entries unintentionally becomes more difficult.  The default selection in the confirmation dialogs for deletion changes from "Yes" to "No". This option is disabled by default.</p><p><em>Auto save setup.</em> If this option is enabled, when you exit the Midnight Commander the configurable options of the Midnight Commander are saved in the ~/.config/mc/ini file.</p>

The suffixes (k, m ...) are shown in lowercase. If disabled (default), Midnight Commander will use binary units (powers of 1024) and the suffixes are shown in upper case (K, M ...)</p><p><em>Mix all files.</em> If this option is enabled, all files and directories are shown mixed together.  If the option is disabled (default), directories (and links to directories) are shown at the beginning of the listing, and other files below.</p><p><em>Show backup files.</em> If enabled, the Midnight Commander will show files ending with a tilde. Otherwise, they won't be shown (like GNU's ls option -B). Enabled by default.</p><p><em>Show hidden files.</em> If enabled, the Midnight Commander will show all files that start with a dot (like ls -a). Disabled by default.</p><p><em>Fast directory reload.</em> If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander will use a trick to determine if the directory contents have changed.  The trick is to reload the directory only if the i-node of the directory has changed; this means that reloads only happen when files are created or deleted.  If what changes is the i-node for a file in the directory (file size changes, mode or owner changes, etc) the display is not updated.  In these cases, if you have the option on, you have to rescan the directory manually (with C-r).

The selection of directories is untouched. If off, the reverse selection is applied to files as well to directories: all unselected items become selected, and vice versa.</p><p><em>Simple swap.</em> If both panels contain file listing, simple swap means that panels exchange its screen positions: left panel become right one, and vice versa. If this option is unchecked, file listing panels exchange its content keeping listing format and sort options. Unchecked by default.</p><p><em>Auto save panels setup.</em> If this option is enabled, when you exit the Midnight Commander the current settings of panels are saved in the ~/.config/mc/panels.ini file. Disabled by default.</p><p><strong>Navigation</strong></p><p><em>Lynx-like motion.</em> If this option is enabled, you may use the arrows keys to automatically chdir if the current selection is a subdirectory and the shell command line is empty. By default, this setting is off.</p><p><em>Page scrolling.</em> If set (the default), panel will scroll by half the display when the cursor reaches the end or the beginning of the panel, otherwise it will just scroll a file at a time.</p><p><em>Mouse page scrolling.</em> Controls whenever scrolling with the mouse wheel is done by pages or line by line on the panels.</p><p><strong>File highlight</strong></p><p>You can specify whether <em>permissions</em> and <em>file types</em> should be highlighted with distinctive Colors. If the permission highlighting is enabled, the parts of the <em>perm</em> and <em>mode</em> display fields which apply to the user running Midnight Commander are highlighted with the color defined by the <em>selected</em> keyword.

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">    Virtual FS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>This option gives you control over the settings of the Virtual File System.</p><p>The Midnight Commander keeps in memory the information related to some of the virtual file systems to speed up the access to the files in the file system (for example, directory listings fetched from FTP servers).</p><p>Also, in order to access the contents of compressed files (for example, compressed tar files) the Midnight Commander needs to create temporary uncompressed files on your disk.</p><p>Since both the information in memory and the temporary files on disk take up resources, you may want to tune the parameters of the cached information to decrease your resource usage or to maximize the speed of access to frequently used file systems.</p><p>Because of the format of the tar archives, the <em>Tar filesystem</em> needs to read the whole file just to load the file entries.  Since most tar files are usually kept compressed (plain tar files are species in extinction), the tar file system has to uncompress the file on the disk in a temporary location and then access the uncompressed file as a regular tar file.</p><p>Now, since we all love to browse files and tar files all over the disk, it's common that you will leave a tar file and then re-enter it later. Since decompression is slow, the Midnight Commander will cache the information in memory for a limited time.  When the timeout expires, all the resources associated with the file system are released.  The default timeout is set to one minute.</p><p>The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to browse directories on remote FTP servers.  It has several options.</p><p><em>ftp anonymous password</em> is the password used when you login as "anonymous".  Some sites require a valid e-mail address.  On the other hand, you probably don't want to give your real e-mail address to untrusted sites, especially if you are not using spam filtering.</p><p>ftpfs keeps the directory listing it fetches from a FTP server in a cache. The cache expire time is configurable with the <em>ftpfs directory cache timeout</em> option.  A low value for this option may slow down every operation on the ftpfs because every operation would require sending a request to the FTP server.</p><p>You can define an FTP proxy host for doing FTP.  Note that most modern firewalls are fully transparent at least for passive FTP (see below), so FTP proxies are considered obsolete.</p><p>If <em>Always use ftp proxy</em> is not set, you can use the exclamation sign to enable proxy for certain hosts.  See FTP File System for examples.</p><p>If this option is set, the program will do two things: consult the /usr/lib/mc/mc.no_proxy file for lines containing host names that are local (if the host name starts with a dot, it is assumed to be a domain) and to assume that any hostnames without dots in their names are directly accessible.  All other hosts will be accessed through the specified FTP proxy.</p><p>You can enable using <em>~/.netrc</em> file, which keeps login names and passwords for ftp servers.  See netrc (5) for the description of the .netrc format.</p><p><em>Use passive mode</em> enables using FTP passive mode, when the connection for data transfer is initiated by the client, not by the server.  This option is recommended and enabled by default.  If this option is turned off, the data connection is initiated by the server.  This may not work with some firewalls.</p>

To do it, you have to specify the correct source mask and usually in the trailing part of the destination specify some wildcards. All the files matching the source mask are copied/renamed according to the target mask.  If there are tagged files, only the tagged files matching the source mask are renamed.</p><p>There are other options which you can set:</p><p><strong>Follow links</strong></p><p>determines whether make the symlinks and hardlinks in the source directory (recursively in subdirectories) new links in the target directory or whether would you like to copy their content.</p><p><strong>Dive into subdirs</strong></p><p>determines the behavior when the source directory is about to be copied, but the target directory already exists.  The default action is to copy the contents of the source directory into the target directory. Enabling this option causes copying the source directory itself into the target directory.</p><p>For example, you want to copy directory <em>/foo</em> containing file <em>bar</em> to <em>/bla/foo</em>, which is an already existing directory.  Normally (when <strong>Dive into subdirs</strong> is not set), mc would copy file <em>/foo/bar</em> into the file <em>/bla/foo/bar</em>. By enabling this option the <em>/bla/foo/foo</em> directory will be created, and <em>/foo/bar</em> will be copied into <em>/bla/foo/foo/bar</em>.</p><p><strong>Preserve attributes</strong></p><p>determines whether to preserve the permissions, timestamps and (if you are root) the ownership of the original files.  If this option is not set, the current value of the umask will be respected.</p><p><strong>Use shell patterns</strong></p><p>When this option is on you can use the '*' and '?' wildcards in the source mask. They work like they do in the shell. In the target mask only the '*' and '&#92;&lt;digit&gt;' wildcards are allowed. The first '*' wildcard in the target mask corresponds to the first wildcard group in the source mask, the second '*' corresponds to the second group and so on.  The '&#92;1' wildcard corresponds to the first wildcard group in the source mask, the '&#92;2' wildcard corresponds to the second group and so on all the way up to '&#92;9'. The '&#92;0' wildcard is the whole filename of the source file.</p><p>Two examples:</p><p>If the source mask is "*.tar.gz", the destination is "/bla/*.tgz" and the file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz", the copy will be "foo.tgz" in "/bla".</p><p>Suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c" would become "c.file" and so on.  The source mask for this is "*.*" and the destination is "&#92;2.&#92;1".</p><p><strong>Use shell patterns off</strong></p><p>When the shell patterns option is off the MC doesn't do automatic grouping anymore. You must use '&#92;(...&#92;)' expressions in the source mask to specify meaning for the wildcards in the target mask. This is more flexible but also requires more typing. Otherwise target masks are similar to the situation when the shell patterns option is on.</p><p>Two examples:</p><p>If the source mask is "^&#92;(.*&#92;)&#92;.tar&#92;.gz$", the destination is "/bla/*.tgz" and the file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz", the copy will be "/bla/foo.tgz".</p><p>Let's suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c" will become "c.file" and so on. The source mask for this is "^&#92;(.*&#92;)&#92;.&#92;(.*&#92;)$" and the destination is "&#92;2.&#92;1".</p><p><strong>Case Conversions</strong></p><p>You can also change the case of the filenames.  If you use '&#92;u' or '&#92;l' in the target mask, the next character will be converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly.</p><p>If you use '&#92;U' or '&#92;L' in the target mask, the next characters will be converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly up to the next '&#92;E' or next '&#92;U', '&#92;L' or the end of the file name.</p><p>The '&#92;u' and '&#92;l' are stronger than '&#92;U' and '&#92;L'.</p><p>For example, if the source mask is '*' ( <em>Use shell patterns</em> on) or '^&#92;(.*&#92;)$' ( <em>Use shell patterns</em> off) and the target mask is '&#92;L&#92;u*' the file names will be converted to have initial upper case and otherwise lower case.</p><p>You can also use '&#92;' as a quote character. For example, '&#92;&#92;' is a backslash and '&#92;*' is an asterisk.</p><p><strong>Stable symlinks</strong></p><p>commands Midnight Commander, that it should change symlinks in the target, so that they'll point to the same location as it did before. With absolute symbolic links this does nothing, but if you have a relative one, it will recompute its value, adding necessary ../ and other directory parts and making the value as short as possible (most modern filesystems keep short symlinks inside inodes and thus don't waste much disk space).</p>

<li><p>Options of editor in ini-file</p></li>
</ul><p>The editor is very easy to use and requires no tutoring. To see what keys do what, just consult the appropriate pull-down menu. Other keys are: Shift movement keys do text highlighting. <strong>Ctrl-Ins</strong> copies to the file <strong>mcedit.clip</strong> and <strong>Shift-Ins</strong> pastes from mcedit.clip. <strong>Shift-Del</strong> cuts to <strong>mcedit.clip</strong>, and <strong>Ctrl-Del</strong> deletes highlighted text. Mouse highlighting also works, and you can override the mouse as usual by holding down the shift key while dragging the mouse to let normal terminal mouse highlighting work.</p><p>To define a macro, press <strong>Ctrl-R</strong> and then type out the key strokes you want to be executed. Press <strong>Ctrl-R</strong> again when finished. You can then assign the macro to any key you like by pressing that key. The macro is executed when you press <strong>Ctrl-A</strong> and then the assigned key. The macro is also executed if you press Meta, Ctrl, or Esc and the assigned key, provided that the key is not used for any other function. Once defined, the macro commands go into the file <strong>~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/mcedit.macros</strong> You can delete a macro by deleting the appropriate line in this file.</p><p>To change charset of displayed text may use M-e (Alt-e). Recoding is made from selected codepage into system codepage. To cancel the recoding you may select "&lt;No translation&gt;" in charset selection dialog.</p><p><strong>F19</strong> will format the currently highlighted block (plain text or <strong>C</strong> or <strong>C++</strong> code or another). This is controlled by the file <strong>/usr/share/mc/edit.indent.rc</strong> which is copied to <strong>~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/edit.indent.rc</strong> in your home directory the first time you use it.</p><p>The editor also displays non-us characters (160+). When editing binary files, you should set <strong>display bits</strong> to 7 bits in the options menu to keep the spacing clean.</p>

<p>The Midnight Commander is provided with a code layer to access the file system; this code layer is known as the virtual file system switch.  The virtual file system switch allows the Midnight Commander to manipulate files not located on the Unix file system.</p><p>Currently the Midnight Commander is packaged with some Virtual File Systems (VFS): the <em>local</em> file system, used for accessing the regular Unix file system; the <em>ftpfs</em>, used to manipulate files on remote systems with the FTP protocol; the <em>tarfs</em>, used to manipulate tar and compressed tar files; the <em>undelfs</em>, used to recover deleted files on ext2 file systems (the default file system for Linux systems), <em>fish</em> (for manipulating files over shell connections such as rsh and ssh). If the code was compiled with <em>sftpfs</em> (for manipulating files over SFTP connections). If the code was compiled with <em>smbfs</em> support, you can manipulate files on remote systems with the SMB (CIFS) protocol.</p><p>A generic <em>extfs</em> (EXTernal virtual File System) is provided in order to easily expand VFS capabilities using scripts and external software.</p><p>The VFS switch code will interpret all of the path names used and will forward them to the correct file system, the formats used for each one of the file systems is described later in their own section.</p>

<p>The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to manipulate files on remote machines.  To actually use it, you can use the <em>FTP link</em> item in the menu or directly change your current directory using the <em>cd</em> command to a path name that looks like this:</p><p><em>ftp://[!][user[:pass]@]machine[:port][remote-dir]</em></p><p>The <em>user</em>, <em>port</em> and <em>remote-dir</em> elements are optional.  If you specify the <em>user</em> element, the Midnight Commander will login to the remote machine as that user, otherwise it will use anonymous login or the login name from the <em>~/.netrc</em> file.  The optional <em>pass</em> element is the password used for the connection.  Using the password in the VFS directory name is not recommended, because it can appear on the screen in clear text and can be saved to the directory history.</p><p>To enable using FTP proxy, prepend <strong>!</strong> (an exclamation sign) to the hostname.</p><p>Examples:</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>extfs</strong> allows you to integrate numerous features and file types into GNU Midnight Commander in an easy way, by writing scripts.</p><p>Extfs filesystems can be divided into two categories:</p><p>1. Stand-alone filesystems, which are not associated with any existing file.  They represent certain system-wide data as a directory tree. You can invoke them by typing '<em>cd fsname://</em>' where fsname is an extfs short name (see below).  Examples of such filesystems include audio (list audio tracks on the CD) or apt (list of all Debian packages in the system).</p><p>For example, to list CD-Audio tracks on your CD-ROM drive, type</p>
<pre>
  cd audio://
</pre>
<p>2. 'Archive' filesystems (like rpm, patchfs and more), which represent contents of a file as a directory tree.  It can consist of 'real' files compressed in an archive (urar, rpm) or virtual files, like messages in a mailbox (mailfs) or parts of a patch (patchfs).  To access such filesystems '<em>fsname://</em>' should be appended to the archive name.  Note that the archive itself can be on another vfs.</p><p>For example, to list contents of a zip archive documents.zip type</p>
<pre>
  cd documents.zip/uzip://
</pre>
<p>In many aspects, you could treat extfs like any other directory.  For instance, you can add it to the hotlist or change to it from directory history.  An important limitation is that you cannot invoke shell commands inside extfs, just like any other non-local VFS.</p><p>Common extfs scripts included with Midnight Commander are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>a</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>access 'A:' DOS/Windows diskette (<em>cd a://</em>).</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">Colors</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The Midnight Commander will try to detect if your terminal supports color using the terminal database and your terminal name.  Sometimes it gets confused, so you may force color mode or disable color mode using the -c and -b flag respectively.</p><p>If the program is compiled with the Slang screen manager instead of ncurses, it will also check the variable <strong>COLORTERM,</strong> if it is set, it has the same effect as the -c flag.</p><p>You may specify terminals that always force color mode by adding the <em>color_terminals</em> variable to the Colors section of the initialization file.  This will prevent the Midnight Commander from trying to detect if your terminal supports color.  Example:</p>
<pre>
[Colors]
color_terminals=linux,xterm
color_terminals=terminal-name1,terminal-name2...
</pre>
<p>The program can be compiled with both ncurses and slang, ncurses does not provide a way to force color mode: ncurses uses just the information in the terminal database.</p><p>The Midnight Commander provides a way to change the default colors. Currently the colors are configured using the environment variable <strong>MC_COLOR_TABLE</strong> or the Colors section in the initialization file.</p><p>In the Colors section, the default color map is loaded from the <em>base_color</em> variable.  You can specify an alternate color map for a terminal by using the terminal name as the key in this section.  Example:</p>
<pre>
[Colors]
base_color=
xterm=menu=magenta:marked=,magenta:markselect=,red
</pre>
<p>The format for the color definition is:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;keyword&gt;=&lt;fgcolor&gt;,&lt;bgcolor&gt;,&lt;attributes&gt;:&lt;keyword&gt;=...
</pre>
<p>The colors are optional, and the keywords are: normal, selected, disabled, marked, markselect, errors, input, inputmark, inputunchanged, commandlinemark, reverse, gauge, header, inputhistory, commandhistory. Button bar colors are: bbarhotkey, bbarbutton. Status bar color: statusbar. Menu colors are: menunormal, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel, menuinactive. Dialog colors are: dnormal, dfocus, dhotnormal, dhotfocus, dtitle. Error dialog colors are: errdfocus, errdhotnormal, errdhotfocus, errdtitle.  Help colors are: helpnormal, helpitalic, helpbold, helplink, helpslink, helptitle.  Viewer colors are: viewnormal, viewbold, viewunderline, viewselected. Editor colors are: editnormal, editbold, editmarked, editwhitespace, editlinestate. Popup menu colors are: pmenunormal, pmenusel, pmenutitle.</p><p><em>header</em> determines the color of panel header, the line that contains column titles and sort mode indicator.</p><p><em>input</em> determines the color of input lines used in query dialogs.</p><p><em>gauge</em> determines the color of the filled part of the progress bar (gauge), which is used to show the user the progress of file operations, such as copying.</p><p><em>disabled</em> determines the color of the widget that cannot be selected.</p><p>The dialog boxes use the following colors: <em>dnormal</em> is used for the normal text, <em>dfocus</em> is the color used for the currently selected component, <em>dhotnormal</em> is the color used to differentiate the hotkey color in normal components, whereas the <em>dhotfocus</em> color is used for the highlighted color in the currently selected component.</p><p>Menus use the same scheme but uses the menunormal, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel and menuinactive tags instead.</p><p>Help uses the following colors: <em>helpnormal</em> is used for normal text, <em>helpitalic</em> is used for text which is emphasized in italic in the manual page, <em>helpbold</em> is used for text which is emphasized in bold in the manual page, <em>helplink</em> is used for not selected hyperlinks and <em>helpslink</em> is used for selected hyperlink.</p><p>Popup menu uses following colors: <em>pmenunormal</em> is used for non-selected menu items and as a main color of popup menu window, <em>pmenusel</em> is used for selected menu item, <em>pmenutitle</em> is used for popup menu title.</p><p>The possible colors are: black, gray, red, brightred, green, brightgreen, brown, yellow, blue, brightblue, magenta, brightmagenta, cyan, brightcyan, lightgray and white. And there is a special keyword for transparent background. It is 'default'. The 'default' can only be used for background color. Another special keyword "base" means mc's main colors.  When 256 colors are available, they can be specified either as color16 to color255, or as rgb000 to rgb555 and gray0 to gray23. Example:</p>
<pre>
[Colors]
base_color=normal=white,default:marked=magenta,default
</pre>
<p>Attributes can be any of bold, underline, reverse and blink, appended by a plus sign if more than one are desired.  The special word "none" means no attributes, without attempting to fall back to base_color.  Example:</p>
<pre>
menuhotsel=yellow;black;bold+underline
</pre>

<p>Most of the Midnight Commander settings can be changed from the menus. However, there are a small number of settings which can only be changed by editing the setup file.</p><p>These variables may be set in your ~/.config/mc/ini file:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>clear_before_exec</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>By default the Midnight Commander clears the screen before executing a command.  If you would prefer to see the output of the command at the bottom of the screen, edit your ~/.config/mc/ini file and change the value of the field clear_before_exec to 0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>confirm_view_dir</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If you press F3 on a directory, normally MC enters that directory.  If this flag is set to 1, then MC will ask for confirmation before changing the directory if you have files tagged.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>ftpfs_retry_seconds</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This value is the number of seconds the Midnight Commander will wait before attempting to reconnect to an FTP server that has denied the login.  If the value is zero, the login will no be retried.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>max_dirt_limit</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies how many screen updates can be skipped at most in the internal file viewer.  Normally this value is not significant, because the code automatically adjusts the number of updates to skip according to the rate of incoming keystrokes.  However, on very slow machines or terminals with a fast keyboard auto repeat, a big value can make screen updates too jumpy.</p><ul>
<li><p>It seems that setting max_dirt_limit to 10 causes the best behavior, and that is the default value.</p></li>
</ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>mouse_move_pages_viewer</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Controls if scrolling with the mouse is done by pages or line by line on the internal file viewer.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>only_leading_plus_minus</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Allow special treatment for '+', '-', '*' in the command line (select, unselect, reverse selection) only if the command line is empty.  You don't need to quote those characters in the middle of the command line. On the other hand, you cannot use them to change selection when the command line is not empty.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>show_output_starts_shell</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This variable only works if you are not using the subshell support. When you use the C-o keystroke to go back to the user screen, if this one is set, you will get a fresh shell.  Otherwise, pressing any key will bring you back to the Midnight Commander.</p>

    <p>If this flag is set, then the home and end keys will work slightly different on the panels, instead of moving the selection to the first and last files in the panels, they will act as follows:</p><ul>
<li><p>The home key will: Go up to the middle line, if below it; else go to the top line unless it is already on the top line, in this case it will go to the first file in the panel.</p></li><li><p>The end key has a similar behavior: Go down to the middle line, if over it; else go to the bottom line unless you already are at the bottom line, in such case it will move the selection to the last file name in the panel.</p></li>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>use_file_to_guess_type</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this variable is on (the default) it will spawn the file command to match the file types listed on the mc.ext file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>xtree_mode</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this variable is on (default is off) when you browse the file system on a Tree panel, it will automatically reload the other panel with the contents of the selected directory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>fish_directory_timeout</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This variable holds the lifetime of a directory cache entry in seconds. The default value is 900 seconds.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>clipboard_store</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This variable contains path (with options) to the external clipboard utility like 'xclip' to read text into X selection from file. For example:</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<pre>
clipboard_store=xclip -i
</pre>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>clipboard_paste</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This variable contains path (with options) to the external clipboard utility like 'xclip' to print the selection to standard out. For example:</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<pre>
clipboard_paste=xclip -o
</pre>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>autodetect_codeset</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option allows use the `enca' command to autodetect codeset of text files in internal viewer and editor. List of valid values can be obtain by the `enca --list languages | cut -d : -f1' command. Option must be located in the [Misc] section.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">Parameters for external editor or viewer</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The Midnight Commander provides a way for specify an options for external editors and viewers. The Midnight Commander tries to search the "[External editor or viewer parameters]" section in the system initialization file (the mc.lib file located in the Midnight Commander library directory) and then in the ~/.config/mc/ini file. The option name should be equal to the name (full pathname) of external editor or viewer. The option value can contain following variables:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>%filename</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The filename to edit/view.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>%lineno</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The start line in the opening file.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
[External editor or viewer parameters]
    vi=%filename +%lineno
    joe=%filename +%lineno
    more=%filename +%lineno
</pre>
<p>Start line is passed to the external editor/viewer only if it is called from the Find file results window.</p><p>If external editor/viewer is launched via F4/F3 keys, MC hopes that program (at least "joe", but probably others too) has an own feature that by default opens the file where it was last open. MC doesn't prevent external editor/viewer to save and restore position in opened files.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">Terminal databases</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The Midnight Commander provides a way to fix your system terminal database without requiring root privileges.  The Midnight Commander searches in the system initialization file (the mc.lib file located in the Midnight Commander library directory) and in the ~/.config/mc/ini file for the section "terminal:your-terminal-name" and then for the section "terminal:general", each line of the section contains a key symbol that you want to define, followed by an equal sign and the definition for the key.  You can use the special &#92;e form to represent the escape character and the ^x to represent the control-x character.</p><p>The possible key symbols are:</p>
<pre>
f0 to f20     Function keys f0-f20
bs            backspace
home          home key
end           end key
up            up arrow key
down          down arrow key
left          left arrow key
right         right arrow key
pgdn          page down key
pgup          page up key
insert        the insert character
delete        the delete character
complete      to do completion
</pre>
<p>For example, to define the key insert to be the Escape + [ + O + p, you set this in the ini file:</p>
<pre>
insert=&#92;e[Op
</pre>
<p>Also now you can use <em>extended learn keys.</em> For example:</p>
<pre>
    ctrl-alt-right=&#92;e[[1;6C
    ctrl-alt-left=&#92;e[[1;6D
</pre>
<p>This means that ctrl+alt+left sends a &#92;e[[1;6D escape sequence and therefore Midnight Commander interprets "&#92;e[[1;6D" as Ctrl-Alt-Left.</p><p>The <em>complete</em> key symbol represents the escape sequences used to invoke the completion process, this is invoked with Alt-tab, but you can define other keys to do the same work (on those keyboard with tons of nice and unused keys everywhere).</p>
