        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<p><strong>ld</strong> combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in compiling a program is to run <strong>ld</strong>.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p><strong>ld</strong> accepts Linker Command Language files written in a superset of \s-1AT&T\s0's Link Editor Command Language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>This man page does not describe the command language; see the <strong>ld</strong> entry in \f(CW\*(C`info\*(C' for full details on the command language and on other aspects of the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>This version of <strong>ld</strong> uses the general purpose \s-1BFD\s0 libraries to operate on object files. This allows <strong>ld</strong> to read, combine, and write object files in many different formats---for example, \s-1COFF\s0 or \f(CW\*(C`a.out\*(C'.  Different formats may be linked together to produce any available kind of object file.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>Aside from its flexibility, the \s-1GNU\s0 linker is more helpful than other linkers in providing diagnostic information.  Many linkers abandon execution immediately upon encountering an error; whenever possible, <strong>ld</strong> continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors (or, in some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>The \s-1GNU\s0 linker <strong>ld</strong> is meant to cover a broad range of situations, and to be as compatible as possible with other linkers.  As a result, you have many choices to control its behavior.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<p>The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but in actual practice few of them are used in any particular context. For instance, a frequent use of <strong>ld</strong> is to link standard Unix object files on a standard, supported Unix system.  On such a system, to link a file \f(CW\*(C`hello.o\*(C':</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<pre>        ld -o &lt;output&gt; /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc</pre>

<p class='spacer'>

<p>This tells <strong>ld</strong> to produce a file called <em>output</em> as the result of linking the file \f(CW\*(C`/lib/crt0.o\*(C' with \f(CW\*(C`hello.o\*(C' and the library \f(CW\*(C`libc.a\*(C', which will come from the standard search directories.  (See the discussion of the <strong>-l</strong> option below.)</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>Some of the command-line options to <strong>ld</strong> may be specified at any point in the command line.  However, options which refer to files, such as <strong>-l</strong> or <strong>-T</strong>, cause the file to be read at the point at which the option appears in the command line, relative to the object files and other file options.  Repeating non-file options with a different argument will either have no further effect, or override prior occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of that option.  Options which may be meaningfully specified more than once are noted in the descriptions below.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>Non-option arguments are object files or archives which are to be linked together.  They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between an option and its argument.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can specify other forms of binary input files using <strong>-l</strong>, <strong>-R</strong>, and the script command language.  If <em>no</em> binary input files at all are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the message <strong>No input files</strong>.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object file, it will assume that it is a linker script.  A script specified in this way augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default linker script or the one specified by using <strong>-T</strong>).  This feature permits the linker to link against a file which appears to be an object or an archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C' or \f(CW\*(C`GROUP\*(C' to load other objects.  Specifying a script in this way merely augments the main linker script, with the extra commands placed after the main script; use the <strong>-T</strong> option to replace the default linker script entirely, but note the effect of the \f(CW\*(C`INSERT\*(C' command.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>For options whose names are a single letter, option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening whitespace, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the option that requires them.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can precede the option name; for example, <strong>-trace-symbol</strong> and <strong>--trace-symbol</strong> are equivalent.  Note---there is one exception to this rule.  Multiple letter options that start with a lower case 'o' can only be preceded by two dashes.  This is to reduce confusion with the <strong>-o</strong> option.  So for example <strong>-omagic</strong> sets the output file name to <strong>magic</strong> whereas <strong>--omagic</strong> sets the \s-1NMAGIC\s0 flag on the output.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from the option name by an equals sign, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the option that requires them.  For example, <strong>--trace-symbol foo</strong> and <strong>--trace-symbol=foo</strong> are equivalent. Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are accepted.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>Note---if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver (e.g. <strong>gcc</strong>) then all the linker command line options should be prefixed by <strong>-Wl,</strong> (or whatever is appropriate for the particular compiler driver) like this:</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<pre>          gcc -Wl,--start-group foo.o bar.o -Wl,--end-group</pre>

<p class='spacer'>

<p>This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver program may silently drop the linker options, resulting in a bad link.  Confusion may also arise when passing options that require values through a driver, as the use of a space between option and argument acts as a separator, and causes the driver to pass only the option to the linker and the argument to the compiler.  In this case, it is simplest to use the joined forms of both single- and multiple-letter options, such as:</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<pre>          gcc foo.o bar.o -Wl,-eENTRY -Wl,-Map=a.map</pre>

<p class='spacer'>

  <p>Here is a table of the generic command line switches accepted by the \s-1GNU\s0 linker:</p>
  <dl class='dl-horizontal'>
    <dt><strong>@</strong><em>file</em></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Read command-line options from <em>file</em>.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @<em>file</em> option.  If <em>file</em> does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not removed.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>Options in <em>file</em> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The <em>file</em> may itself contain additional @<em>file</em> options; any such options will be processed recursively.</p>
  <dl class='dl-horizontal'>
    <dt><strong>-a</strong> <em>keyword</em></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>This option is supported for \s-1HP/UX\s0 compatibility.  The <em>keyword</em> argument must be one of the strings <strong>archive</strong>, <strong>shared</strong>, or <strong>default</strong>.  <strong>-aarchive</strong> is functionally equivalent to <strong>-Bstatic</strong>, and the other two keywords are functionally equivalent to <strong>-Bdynamic</strong>.  This option may be used any number of times.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--audit</strong> <em>\s-1AUDITLIB\s0</em></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Adds <em>\s-1AUDITLIB\s0</em> to the \f(CW\*(C`DT_AUDIT\*(C' entry of the dynamic section. <em>\s-1AUDITLIB\s0</em> is not checked for existence, nor will it use the \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 specified in the library.  If specified multiple times \f(CW\*(C`DT_AUDIT\*(C' will contain a colon separated list of audit interfaces to use. If the linker finds an object with an audit entry while searching for shared libraries, it will add a corresponding \f(CW\*(C`DT_DEPAUDIT\*(C' entry in the output file. This option is only meaningful on \s-1ELF\s0 platforms supporting the rtld-audit interface.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>-A</strong> <em>architecture</em></dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--architecture=</strong><em>architecture</em></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>In the current release of <strong>ld</strong>, this option is useful only for the Intel 960 family of architectures.  In that <strong>ld</strong> configuration, the <em>architecture</em> argument identifies the particular architecture in the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the archive-library search path.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>Future releases of <strong>ld</strong> may support similar functionality for other architecture families.</p>
  <dl class='dl-horizontal'>
    <dt><strong>-b</strong> <em>input-format</em></dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--format=</strong><em>input-format</em></dt>
    <dd>
  <p><strong>ld</strong> may be configured to support more than one kind of object file.  If your <strong>ld</strong> is configured this way, you can use the <strong>-b</strong> option to specify the binary format for input object files that follow this option on the command line.  Even when <strong>ld</strong> is configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need to specify this, as <strong>ld</strong> should be configured to expect as a default input format the most usual format on each machine. <em>input-format</em> is a text string, the name of a particular format supported by the \s-1BFD\s0 libraries.  (You can list the available binary formats with <strong>objdump -i</strong>.)</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual binary format.  You can also use <strong>-b</strong> to switch formats explicitly (when linking object files of different formats), by including <strong>-b</strong> <em>input-format</em> before each group of object files in a particular format.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>The default format is taken from the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>You can also define the input format from a script, using the command \f(CW\*(C`TARGET\*(C';</p>
  <dl class='dl-horizontal'>
    <dt><strong>-c</strong> <em>MRI-commandfile</em></dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--mri-script=</strong><em>MRI-commandfile</em></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>For compatibility with linkers produced by \s-1MRI, \s0<strong>ld</strong> accepts script files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described in the \s-1MRI\s0 Compatible Script Files section of \s-1GNU\s0 ld documentation. Introduce \s-1MRI\s0 script files with the option <strong>-c</strong>; use the <strong>-T</strong> option to run linker scripts written in the general-purpose <strong>ld</strong> scripting language. If <em>MRI-cmdfile</em> does not exist, <strong>ld</strong> looks for it in the directories specified by any <strong>-L</strong> options.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>-d</strong></dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>-dc</strong></dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>-dp</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for compatibility with other linkers.  They assign space to common symbols even if a relocatable output file is specified (with <strong>-r</strong>).  The script command \f(CW\*(C`FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION\*(C' has the same effect.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--depaudit</strong> <em>\s-1AUDITLIB\s0</em></dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>-P</strong> <em>\s-1AUDITLIB\s0</em></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Adds <em>\s-1AUDITLIB\s0</em> to the \f(CW\*(C`DT_DEPAUDIT\*(C' entry of the dynamic section. <em>\s-1AUDITLIB\s0</em> is not checked for existence, nor will it use the \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 specified in the library.  If specified multiple times \f(CW\*(C`DT_DEPAUDIT\*(C' will contain a colon separated list of audit interfaces to use.  This option is only meaningful on \s-1ELF\s0 platforms supporting the rtld-audit interface. The -P option is provided for Solaris compatibility.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>-e</strong> <em>entry</em></dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--entry=</strong><em>entry</em></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Use <em>entry</em> as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your program, rather than the default entry point.  If there is no symbol named <em>entry</em>, the linker will try to parse <em>entry</em> as a number, and use that as the entry address (the number will be interpreted in base 10; you may use a leading <strong>0x</strong> for base 16, or a leading <strong>0</strong> for base 8).</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--exclude-libs</strong> <em>lib</em><strong>,</strong><em>lib</em><strong>,...</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Specifies a list of archive libraries from which symbols should not be automatically exported.  The library names may be delimited by commas or colons.  Specifying \f(CW\*(C`--exclude-libs ALL\*(C' excludes symbols in all archive libraries from automatic export.  This option is available only for the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker and for \s-1ELF\s0 targeted ports.  For i386 \s-1PE,\s0 symbols explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported, regardless of this option.  For \s-1ELF\s0 targeted ports, symbols affected by this option will be treated as hidden.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--exclude-modules-for-implib</strong> <em>module</em><strong>,</strong><em>module</em><strong>,...</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Specifies a list of object files or archive members, from which symbols should not be automatically exported, but which should be copied wholesale into the import library being generated during the link.  The module names may be delimited by commas or colons, and must match exactly the filenames used by <strong>ld</strong> to open the files; for archive members, this is simply the member name, but for object files the name listed must include and match precisely any path used to specify the input file on the linker's command-line.  This option is available only for the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker.  Symbols explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported, regardless of this option.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>-E</strong></dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--export-dynamic</strong></dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--no-export-dynamic</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>When creating a dynamically linked executable, using the <strong>-E</strong> option or the <strong>--export-dynamic</strong> option causes the linker to add all symbols to the dynamic symbol table.  The dynamic symbol table is the set of symbols which are visible from dynamic objects at run time.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>If you do not use either of these options (or use the <strong>--no-export-dynamic</strong> option to restore the default behavior), the dynamic symbol table will normally contain only those symbols which are referenced by some dynamic object mentioned in the link.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>If you use \f(CW\*(C`dlopen\*(C' to load a dynamic object which needs to refer back to the symbols defined by the program, rather than some other dynamic object, then you will probably need to use this option when linking the program itself.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>You can also use the dynamic list to control what symbols should be added to the dynamic symbol table if the output format supports it. See the description of <strong>--dynamic-list</strong>.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>Note that this option is specific to \s-1ELF\s0 targeted ports.  \s-1PE\s0 targets support a similar function to export all symbols from a \s-1DLL\s0 or \s-1EXE\s0; see the description of <strong>--export-all-symbols</strong> below.</p>
  <dl class='dl-horizontal'>
    <dt><strong>-EB</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Link big-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>-EL</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Link little-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>-f</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--auxiliary=</strong><em>name</em></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 field to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the symbol table of the shared object <em>name</em>.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you run the program, the dynamic linker will see the \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 field.  If the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter object, it will first check whether there is a definition in the shared object <em>name</em>.  If there is one, it will be used instead of the definition in the filter object.  The shared object <em>name</em> need not exist. Thus the shared object <em>name</em> may be used to provide an alternative implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging or for machine specific performance.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>This option may be specified more than once.  The \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 entries will be created in the order in which they appear on the command line.</p>
  <dl class='dl-horizontal'>
    <dt><strong>-F</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--filter=</strong><em>name</em></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_FILTER\s0 field to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table of the shared object which is being created should be used as a filter on the symbol table of the shared object <em>name</em>.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you run the program, the dynamic linker will see the \s-1DT_FILTER\s0 field.  The dynamic linker will resolve symbols according to the symbol table of the filter object as usual, but it will actually link to the definitions found in the shared object <em>name</em>.  Thus the filter object can be used to select a subset of the symbols provided by the object <em>name</em>.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>Some older linkers used the <strong>-F</strong> option throughout a compilation toolchain for specifying object-file format for both input and output object files. The \s-1GNU\s0 linker uses other mechanisms for this purpose: the <strong>-b</strong>, <strong>--format</strong>, <strong>--oformat</strong> options, the \f(CW\*(C`TARGET\*(C' command in linker scripts, and the \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C' environment variable. The \s-1GNU\s0 linker will ignore the <strong>-F</strong> option when not creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object.</p>
  <dl class='dl-horizontal'>
    <dt><strong>-fini=</strong><em>name</em></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 executable or shared object, call \s-1NAME\s0 when the executable or shared object is unloaded, by setting \s-1DT_FINI\s0 to the address of the function.  By default, the linker uses \f(CW\*(C`_fini\*(C' as the function to call.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>-g</strong></dt>

When an executable is linked with a shared object which has a \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 field, then when the executable is run the dynamic linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.</p>

  <p>Add the archive or object file specified by <em>namespec</em> to the list of files to link.  This option may be used any number of times. If <em>namespec</em> is of the form <em>:filename</em>, <strong>ld</strong> will search the library path for a file called <em>filename</em>, otherwise it will search the library path for a file called <em>libnamespec.a</em>.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>On systems which support shared libraries, <strong>ld</strong> may also search for files other than <em>libnamespec.a</em>.  Specifically, on \s-1ELF\s0 and SunOS systems, <strong>ld</strong> will search a directory for a library called <em>libnamespec.so</em> before searching for one called <em>libnamespec.a</em>.  (By convention, a \f(CW\*(C`.so\*(C' extension indicates a shared library.)  Note that this behavior does not apply to <em>:filename</em>, which always specifies a file called <em>filename</em>.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>The linker will search an archive only once, at the location where it is specified on the command line.  If the archive defines a symbol which was undefined in some object which appeared before the archive on the command line, the linker will include the appropriate file(s) from the archive.  However, an undefined symbol in an object appearing later on the command line will not cause the linker to search the archive again.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>See the <strong>-(</strong> option for a way to force the linker to search archives multiple times.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>You may list the same archive multiple times on the command line.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>This type of archive searching is standard for Unix linkers.  However, if you are using <strong>ld</strong> on \s-1AIX,\s0 note that it is different from the behaviour of the \s-1AIX\s0 linker.</p>

  <p>Add path <em>searchdir</em> to the list of paths that <strong>ld</strong> will search for archive libraries and <strong>ld</strong> control scripts.  You may use this option any number of times.  The directories are searched in the order in which they are specified on the command line.  Directories specified on the command line are searched before the default directories.  All <strong>-L</strong> options apply to all <strong>-l</strong> options, regardless of the order in which the options appear.  <strong>-L</strong> options do not affect how <strong>ld</strong> searches for a linker script unless <strong>-T</strong> option is specified.</p>

<p class='spacer'>

<p>The default set of paths searched (without being specified with <strong>-L</strong>) depends on which emulation mode <strong>ld</strong> is using, and in some cases also on how it was configured.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>The paths can also be specified in a link script with the \f(CW\*(C`SEARCH_DIR\*(C' command.  Directories specified this way are searched at the point in which the linker script appears in the command line.</p>

    <p>Note - symbols whose values are computed by an expression which involves a reference to a previous value of the same symbol may not have correct result displayed in the link map.  This is because the linker discards intermediate results and only retains the final value of an expression.  Under such circumstances the linker will display the final value enclosed by square brackets.  Thus for example a linker script containing:</p>
<p class='spacer'>

           foo = foo * 4
           foo = foo + 8</pre>

  <p>Generate relocatable output---i.e., generate an output file that can in turn serve as input to <strong>ld</strong>.  This is often called <em>partial linking</em>.  As a side effect, in environments that support standard Unix magic numbers, this option also sets the output file's magic number to \f(CW\*(C`OMAGIC\*(C'. If this option is not specified, an absolute file is produced.

<p>When an input file does not have the same format as the output file, partial linking is only supported if that input file does not contain any relocations.  Different output formats can have further restrictions; for example some \f(CW\*(C`a.out\*(C'-based formats do not support partial linking with input files in other formats at all.</p>

It does not work to use <strong>-Ur</strong> on files that were themselves linked with <strong>-Ur</strong>; once the constructor table has been built, it cannot be added to.

  <p>This option affects the treatment of dynamic libraries referred to by \s-1DT_NEEDED\s0 tags <em>inside</em> \s-1ELF\s0 dynamic libraries mentioned on the command line.  Normally the linker won't add a \s-1DT_NEEDED\s0 tag to the output binary for each library mentioned in a \s-1DT_NEEDED\s0 tag in an input dynamic library.

  <p>This option also has an effect on the resolution of symbols in dynamic libraries.

  <p>The format of the table is intentionally simple, so that it may be easily processed by a script if necessary.  The symbols are printed out, sorted by name.

<p class='spacer'>

  <p>The <strong>--no-define-common</strong> option allows decoupling the decision to assign addresses to Common symbols from the choice of the output file type; otherwise a non-Relocatable output type forces assigning addresses to Common symbols. Using <strong>--no-define-common</strong> allows Common symbols that are referenced from a shared library to be assigned addresses only in the main program. This eliminates the unused duplicate space in the shared library, and also prevents any possible confusion over resolving to the wrong duplicate when there are many dynamic modules with specialized search paths for runtime symbol resolution.</p>

  <p>These options control whether to demangle symbol names in error messages and other output.  When the linker is told to demangle, it tries to present symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips leading underscores if they are used by the object file format, and converts \*(C+ mangled symbol names into user readable names.  Different compilers have different mangling styles.  The optional demangling style argument can be used to choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.

  <p>If a successfully built fully linked output file does not have a \f(CW\*(C`.exe\*(C' or \f(CW\*(C`.dll\*(C' suffix, this option forces the linker to copy the output file to one of the same name with a \f(CW\*(C`.exe\*(C' suffix.

<p><strong>--gc-sections</strong> decides which input sections are used by examining symbols and relocations.

  <p>This option can be set when doing a partial link (enabled with option <strong>-r</strong>).

Note that this will fail to work with object file formats which do not support arbitrary sections.

  <p>Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or with a symbol definition.  Unix linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practice, but linkers on some other operating systems do not.  This option allows you to find potential problems from combining global symbols. Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practice, so you may get some warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as in your programs.</p>

    <p>There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated here by C examples:</p>
    <dl class='dl-horizontal'>
      <dt><strong>int i = 1;</strong></dt>
      <dd>
    <p>A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output file.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>extern int i;</strong></dt>
      <dd>
    <p>An undefined reference, which does not allocate space. There must be either a definition or a common symbol for the variable somewhere.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>int i;</strong></dt>
      <dd>
    <p>A common symbol.  If there are only (one or more) common symbols for a variable, it goes in the uninitialized data area of the output file. The linker merges multiple common symbols for the same variable into a single symbol.  If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest size.  The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if there is a definition of the same variable.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
<p class='spacer'>

    <p>The <strong>--warn-common</strong> option can produce five kinds of warnings. Each warning consists of a pair of lines: the first describes the symbol just encountered, and the second describes the previous symbol encountered with the same name.  One or both of the two symbols will be a common symbol.</p>

  <p>Warn if any global constructors are used.  This is only useful for a few object file formats.  For formats like \s-1COFF\s0 or \s-1ELF,\s0 the linker can not detect the use of global constructors.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--warn-multiple-gp</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Warn if multiple global pointer values are required in the output file. This is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha. Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special section.  A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle of this section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a base-register relative addressing mode.  Since the offset in base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16 bits), this limits the maximum size of the constant pool.  Thus, in large programs, it is often necessary to use multiple global pointer values in order to be able to address all possible constants.  This option causes a warning to be issued whenever this case occurs.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--warn-once</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once per module which refers to it.</p>

    <dt><strong>--warn-section-align</strong></dt>

  <p>Warn if the address of an output section is changed because of alignment.  Typically, the alignment will be set by an input section. The address will only be changed if it not explicitly specified; that is, if the \f(CW\*(C`SECTIONS\*(C' command does not specify a start address for the section.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>--warn-unresolved-symbols</strong></dt>

  <p>If the linker is going to report an unresolved symbol (see the option <strong>--unresolved-symbols</strong>) it will normally generate an error. This option makes it generate a warning instead.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--error-unresolved-symbols</strong></dt>

  <p>This restores the linker's default behaviour of generating errors when it is reporting unresolved symbols.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--whole-archive</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>For each archive mentioned on the command line after the <strong>--whole-archive</strong> option, include every object file in the archive in the link, rather than searching the archive for the required object files.  This is normally used to turn an archive file into a shared library, forcing every object to be included in the resulting shared library.  This option may be used more than once.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc doesn't know about this option, so you have to use <strong>-Wl,-whole-archive</strong>. Second, don't forget to use <strong>-Wl,-no-whole-archive</strong> after your list of archives, because gcc will add its own list of archives to your link and you may not want this flag to affect those as well.</p>

<p>This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system function.  The wrapper function should be called \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'.  If it wishes to call the system function, it should call \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'.</p>

<p class='spacer'>

<p>If you link other code with this file using <strong>--wrap malloc</strong>, then all calls to \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C' will call the function \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C' instead.  The call to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C' in \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C' will call the real \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C' function.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

  <p>You may wish to provide a \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C' function as well, so that links without the <strong>--wrap</strong> option will succeed.  If you do this, you should not put the definition of \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C' in the same file as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'; if you do, the assembler may resolve the call before the linker has a chance to wrap it to \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'.</p>

  <p>The \s-1PE\s0 variants of the Coff object format add an extension that permits the use of section names longer than eight characters, the normal limit for Coff.  By default, these names are only allowed in object files, as fully-linked executable images do not carry the Coff string table required to support the longer names.  As a \s-1GNU\s0 extension, it is possible to allow their use in executable images as well, or to (probably pointlessly!) disallow it in object files, by using these two options.  Executable images generated with these long section names are slightly non-standard, carrying as they do a string table, and may generate confusing output when examined with non-GNU PE-aware tools, such as file viewers and dumpers.  However, \s-1GDB\s0 relies on the use of \s-1PE\s0 long section names to find Dwarf-2 debug information sections in an executable image at runtime, and so if neither option is specified on the command-line, <strong>ld</strong> will enable long section names, overriding the default and technically correct behaviour, when it finds the presence of debug information while linking an executable image and not stripping symbols.

<p>Note - use of the 'auto-import' extension will also cause read only data which would normally be placed into the .rdata section to be placed into the .data section instead.  This is in order to work around a problem with consts that is described here: http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-09/msg01101.html</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>Using 'auto-import' generally will 'just work' \*(-- but sometimes you may see this message:</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>"variable '&lt;var&gt;' can't be auto-imported. Please read the documentation for ld's \f(CW\*(C`--enable-auto-import\*(C' for details."</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>This message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses an address ultimately given by the sum of two constants (Win32 import tables only allow one).  Instances where this may occur include accesses to member fields of struct variables imported from a \s-1DLL,\s0 as well as using a constant index into an array variable imported from a \s-1DLL. \s0 Any multiword variable (arrays, structs, long long, etc) may trigger this error condition.  However, regardless of the exact data type of the offending exported variable, ld will always detect it, issue the warning, and exit.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>There are several ways to address this difficulty, regardless of the data type of the exported variable:</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>One way is to use --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc switch. This leaves the task of adjusting references in your client code for runtime environment, so this method works only when runtime environment supports this feature.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>A second solution is to force one of the 'constants' to be a variable \*(-- that is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile time.  For arrays, there are two possibilities: a) make the indexee (the array's address) a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a variable.  Thus:</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<pre>        extern type extern_array[];
        extern_array[1] --&gt;
           { volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }</pre>

<p class='spacer'>

<p>or</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<pre>        extern type extern_array[];
        extern_array[1] --&gt;
           { volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }</pre>

<p class='spacer'>

<p>For structs (and most other multiword data types) the only option is to make the struct itself (or the long long, or the ...) variable:</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<pre>        extern struct s extern_struct;
        extern_struct.field --&gt;
           { volatile struct s *t=&extern_struct; t-&gt;field }</pre>

<p class='spacer'>

<p>or</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<pre>        extern long long extern_ll;
        extern_ll --&gt;
          { volatile long long * local_ll=&extern_ll; *local_ll }</pre>

<p class='spacer'>

<p>A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to abandon 'auto-import' for the offending symbol and mark it with \f(CW\*(C`_\|_declspec(dllimport)\*(C'.  However, in practice that requires using compile-time #defines to indicate whether you are building a \s-1DLL,\s0 building client code that will link to the \s-1DLL,\s0 or merely building/linking to a static library.   In making the choice between the various methods of resolving the 'direct address with constant offset' problem, you should consider typical real-world usage:</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>Original:</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<pre>        --foo.h
        extern int arr[];
        --foo.c
        #include "foo.h"
        void main(int argc, char **argv){
          printf("%d&#92;n",arr[1]);
        }</pre>

<p class='spacer'>

<p>Solution 1:</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<pre>        --foo.h
        extern int arr[];
        --foo.c
        #include "foo.h"
        void main(int argc, char **argv){
          /* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not "optimize" */
          volatile int *parr = arr;
          printf("%d&#92;n",parr[1]);
        }</pre>

<p class='spacer'>

<p>Solution 2:</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<pre>        --foo.h
        /* Note: auto-export is assumed (no _\|_declspec(dllexport)) */
        #if (defined(_WIN32) || defined(_\|_CYGWIN_\|_)) && &#92;
          !(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) || defined(FOO_STATIC))
        #define FOO_IMPORT _\|_declspec(dllimport)
        #else
        #define FOO_IMPORT
        #endif
        extern FOO_IMPORT int arr[];
        --foo.c
        #include "foo.h"
        void main(int argc, char **argv){
          printf("%d&#92;n",arr[1]);
        }</pre>

<p class='spacer'>

  <p>A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your library to use a functional interface rather than a data interface for the offending variables (e.g. <em>set_foo()</em> and <em>get_foo()</em> accessor functions).

  <p>This option sets the number of entires in the \s-1DSBT\s0 of the current executable or shared library to <em>size</em>.  The default is to create a table with 64 entries.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--dsbt-index</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>This option sets the \s-1DSBT\s0 index of the current executable or shared library to <em>index</em>.  The default is 0, which is appropriate for generating executables.  If a shared library is generated with a \s-1DSBT\s0 index of 0, the \f(CW\*(C`R_C6000_DSBT_INDEX\*(C' relocs are copied into the output file.</p>

  <p>The 68HC11 and 68HC12 linkers support specific options to control the memory bank switching mapping and trampoline code generation.</p>
  <dl class='dl-horizontal'>
    <dt><strong>--no-trampoline</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>This option disables the generation of trampoline. By default a trampoline is generated for each far function which is called using a \f(CW\*(C`jsr\*(C' instruction (this happens when a pointer to a far function is taken).</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--bank-window</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>This option indicates to the linker the name of the memory region in the <strong>\s-1MEMORY\s0</strong> specification that describes the memory bank window. The definition of such region is then used by the linker to compute paging and addresses within the memory window.</p>
    </dd>

  <p>The following options are supported to control handling of \s-1GOT\s0 generation when linking for 68K targets.</p>
  <dl class='dl-horizontal'>
    <dt><strong>--got=</strong><em>type</em></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>This option tells the linker which \s-1GOT\s0 generation scheme to use. <em>type</em> should be one of <strong>single</strong>, <strong>negative</strong>, <strong>multigot</strong> or <strong>target</strong>.  For more information refer to the Info entry for <em>ld</em>.</p>

  <p>The following options are supported to control microMIPS instruction generation when linking for \s-1MIPS\s0 targets.</p>
  <dl class='dl-horizontal'>
    <dt><strong>--insn32</strong></dt>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>--no-insn32</strong></dt>
    <dd>
  <p>These options control the choice of microMIPS instructions used in code generated by the linker, such as that in the \s-1PLT\s0 or lazy binding stubs, or in relaxation.  If <strong>--insn32</strong> is used, then the linker only uses 32-bit instruction encodings.  By default or if <strong>--no-insn32</strong> is used, all instruction encodings are used, including 16-bit ones where possible.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">ENVIRONMENT</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<p>You can change the behaviour of <strong>ld</strong> with the environment variables \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C', \f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C' and \f(CW\*(C`COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\*(C'.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C' determines the input-file object format if you don't use <strong>-b</strong> (or its synonym <strong>--format</strong>).  Its value should be one of the \s-1BFD\s0 names for an input format.  If there is no \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C' in the environment, <strong>ld</strong> uses the natural format of the target. If \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C' is set to \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C' then \s-1BFD\s0 attempts to discover the input format by examining binary input files; this method often succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities, since there is no method of ensuring that the magic number used to specify object-file formats is unique.  However, the configuration procedure for \s-1BFD\s0 on each system places the conventional format for that system first in the search-list, so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>\f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C' determines the default emulation if you don't use the <strong>-m</strong> option.  The emulation can affect various aspects of linker behaviour, particularly the default linker script.  You can list the available emulations with the <strong>--verbose</strong> or <strong>-V</strong> options.  If the <strong>-m</strong> option is not used, and the \f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C' environment variable is not defined, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was configured.</p>
<p class='spacer'>

<p>Normally, the linker will default to demangling symbols.  However, if \f(CW\*(C`COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\*(C' is set in the environment, then it will default to not demangling symbols.  This environment variable is used in a similar fashion by the \f(CW\*(C`gcc\*(C' linker wrapper program.  The default may be overridden by the <strong>--demangle</strong> and <strong>--no-demangle</strong> options.</p>
