        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>C\(hyKermit is an all\(hypurpose communications software package from the Kermit Project at Columbia University that:</p>
<pre>
&bull;	Is portable to many platforms, Unix and non\(hyUnix alike.

&bull;	Can make both serial and network connections.

&bull;	Can conduct interactive terminal sessions over its connection.

&bull;	Can transfer text or binary files over the same connection.

&bull;	Can convert character sets in the terminal session.

&bull;	Can convert character sets during text\(hyfile file transfer.

&bull;	Is customizable in every aspect of its operation.
</pre>
<p>C\(hyKermit is a modem program, a Telnet client, an Rlogin client, an FTP client, an HTTP client, and on selected platforms, also an X.25 client. It can make its own secure Internet connections using IETF\(hyapproved security methods including Kerberos IV, Kerberos V, SSL/TLS, and SRP and it can also make SSH connections through your external SSH client application. It can be the far\(hyend file\(hytransfer or client/server partner of your desktop Kermit client. It can also accept incoming dialed and network connections. It can even be installed as an Internet service on its own standard TCP socket, 1649 [RFC2839, RFC2840].</p><p>And perhaps most important, everything you can do "by hand" (interactively) with C\(hyKermit, can be "scripted" (automated) using its built\(hyin cross\(hyplatform transport\(hyindependent script programming language, which happens to be identical to its interactive command language.</p><p>This manual page offers an overview of C\(hyKermit 9.0 for Unix ("Unix" is an operating system family that includes AIX, DG/UX, FreeBSD, HP\(hyUX, IRIX, Linux, Mac OS X, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Open Server, Open Unix, QNX, Solaris, SunOS, System V R3, System V R4, Tru64 Unix, Unixware, Xenix, and many others). For thorough coverage, please consult the published C\(hyKermit manual and supplements (see DOCUMENTATION below). For further information about C\(hyKermit, Kermit software for other platforms, and Kermit manuals, visit the Kermit Project website:</p>

</pre>
<p>This is a longer\(hythan\(hyaverage manual page, and yet it barely scratches the surface. Don't be daunted. C\(hyKermit is a large and complex package, evolving over decades of practice and experience, but that doesn't mean it's hard to learn or use. Its most commonly used functions are explained here with pointers to additional information elsewhere.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">SYNOPSIS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>kermit [</strong> <em>filename</em> <strong>] [</strong> <em>options</em> <strong>] [ {=,--,+}</strong> <em>text</em> <strong>] ]</strong></p><p>or:</p><p><strong>kermit</strong> <em>URL</em></p><p>If the first command\(hyline argument is the name of a file, interactive\(hymode commands are executed from the file. The '=' (or "--") argument tells Kermit not to parse the remainder of the command line, but to make the words following '=' available as &#92;%1, &#92;%2, ... &#92;%9. The "+" argument is like "=" but for use in "kerbang scripts" (explained below). A second command\(hyline format allows the one and only argument to be a Telnet, FTP, HTTP, or IKSD URL.</p><p>Order of execution:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p> 1.</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command file (if any).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    
<pre>
 2.
The initialization file, if any, unless suppressed with -Y.
</pre>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p> 3.</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The customization file (if it is executed by the initialization file).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p> 4.</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command\(hyline URL (if any, and if so, execution stops here).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p> 5.</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Command\(hyline options (if any).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p> 6.</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Interactive commands.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Some command\(hyline options can cause actions (such as -s to send a file); others just set parameters. If any action options are included on the command line, Kermit exits when finished unless also given the -S ("stay") option. If no action options are given, no initialization or command files contained an EXIT or QUIT command, and no fatal errors occurred, Kermit issues its prompt and waits for you to type commands.</p><ul>
<li><p>Bear in mind that C\(hyKermit can be built with selected features disabled, and also that certain features are not available on all platforms. For example, C\(hyKermit can't be built with TCP/IP support on a platform that does not have TCP/IP header files and libraries (and even if Kermit does include TCP/IP support, it can't be used to make TCP/IP connections on a computer that does not have a TCP/IP stack installed). If your version of C\(hyKermit lacks a feature mentioned here, use its SHOW FEATURES command to see what might have been excluded.</p></li>
</ul><p>C\(hyKermit has three kinds of commands: regular single\(hyletter command\(hyline options, extended\(hyformat command\(hyline options, and interactive commands.</p><p>Like most Unix commands, C\(hyKermit can be be given options on the command line. But C\(hyKermit also can be used interactively by giving it commands composed of words, which are more intuitive than cryptic command\(hyline options, and more flexible too. In other words, you don't have to use C\(hyKermit's command\(hyline options, but they are available if you want to. (By the same token, you don't have to use its interactive commands either \(hy\(hy you can use either or both in any combination.)</p><p>C\(hyKermit is generally installed in the PATH as "kermit", and therefore is invoked by typing the word "kermit" (lowercase) at the shell prompt, and then pressing the Return or Enter key. If you wish to include command\(hyline options, put them after the word "kermit" but before pressing Return or Enter, separated by spaces, for example:</p>
<pre>
  $ kermit -s ckermit.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>('$' is the shell prompt; "kermit -s ckermit.tar.gz" is what you type, followed by Return or Enter.)</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">COMMAND LANGUAGE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>C\(hyKermit's interactive command language is the subject of a 622\(hypage book and another several hundred pages of updates, far too much for a manual page. But it's not hard to get started. At the shell prompt, just type "kermit" to get C\(hyKermit's interactive command prompt:</p>
<pre>
  $ kermit
  (/current/directory) C-Kermit&gt;
</pre>
<p>Begin by typing "help" (and then press the Return or Enter key) for a top\(hylevel overview, read it, and go from there. Your second command should probably be "intro" (introduction). Note the prompt shows your current directory (unless you tell Kermit to prompt you with something else).</p><p>Interactive commands are composed mainly of regular English words, usually in the form of imperative sentences, such as:</p>
<pre>
  send oofa.txt
</pre>
<p>which tells Kermit to send (transfer) the file whose name is oofa.txt, or:</p>
<pre>
  set transfer mode automatic
</pre>
<p>which sets Kermit's "transfer mode" to "automatic" (whatever that means).</p><p>While typing commands, you can abbreviate, ask for help (by pressing the "?" key anywhere in a command), complete keywords or filenames (with the Tab or Esc key), and edit your typing with Backspace or Delete, Ctrl-W, Ctrl-U, etc. You can also recall previous commands, save your command history, and who knows what else. Give the INTRO command for details.</p><p>C\(hyKermit has hundreds of commands, and they can be issued in infinite variety and combinations, including commands for:</p>
<pre>
&bull;	Making connections (SET LINE, DIAL, TELNET, SSH, FTP, ...)

&bull;	Breaking connections (HANGUP, CLOSE)

&bull;	Transferring files (SEND, GET, RECEIVE, MOVE, RESEND, ...)

&bull;	Establishing preferences (SET)

&bull;	Displaying preferences (SHOW)

&bull;	Managing local files (CD, DELETE, MKDIR, DIR, RENAME, TYPE, ...)

&bull;	Managing remote files (RCD, RDEL, RMKDIR, RDIR, ...)

&bull;	Using local files (FOPEN, FCLOSE, FREAD, FWRITE)

&bull;	Programming (TAKE, DEFINE, IF, FOR, WHILE, SWITCH, DECLARE, ...)

&bull;	Interacting with the user (ECHO, ASK, ...)

&bull;	Interacting with a remote computer (INPUT, OUTPUT, ...)

&bull;	Interacting with local programs (RUN, EXEC, PTY, ...)

&bull;	Logging things (LOG SESSION, LOG PACKETS, LOG DEBUG, ...)

</pre>
<p>And of course QUIT or EXIT to get out and HELP to get help, and for programmers: loops, decision making, variables, arrays, associative arrays, integer and floating point arithmetic, macros, built\(hyin and user\(hydefined functions, string manipulation, pattern matching, block structure, scoping, recursion, and all the rest. To get a list of all C\(hyKermit's commands, type a question mark (?) at the prompt. To get a description of any command, type HELP followed by the name of the command, for example:</p>
<pre>
  help send
</pre>
<p>The command interruption character is Ctrl-C (hold down the Ctrl key and press the C key).</p><p>The command language "escape character", used to introduce variable names, function invocations, and so on, is backslash (\). If you need to include a literal backslash in a command, type two of them, e.g.:</p>
<pre>
  get c:&#92;k95&#92;k95custom.ini
</pre>
<h3>Command Files, Macros, and Scripts</h3>
<p>A file containing Kermit commands is called a Kermit command file or Kermit script. It can be executed with Kermit's TAKE command:</p>
<pre>
  (/current/dir) C-Kermit&gt; take commandfile
</pre>
<p>(where "commandfile" is the name of the command file). Please don't pipe a command file into Kermit's standard input (which might or might not work); if you have Kermit commands in a file, tell Kermit to TAKE the file.</p><p>In Unix only, a Kermit command file can also be executed directly by including a "kerbang" line as the first line of the file:</p>
<pre>
  #!/usr/local/bin/kermit +
</pre>
<p>That is, a top line that starts with "#!", followed immediately by the full path of the Kermit executable, and then, if the Kermit script is to be given arguments on the command line, a space and a plus sign. The script file must also have execute permission:</p>
<pre>
  chmod +x commandfile
</pre>
<p>Except for the " +" part, this is exactly the same as you would do for a shell script, a Perl script, etc. Here's a simple but useless example script that regurgitates its arguments (up to three of them):</p>
<pre>
  #!/usr/local/bin/kermit +
  if defined &#92;%1 echo "Argument 1: &#92;%1"
  if defined &#92;%2 echo "Argument 2: &#92;%2"
  if defined &#92;%3 echo "Argument 3: &#92;%3"
  if defined &#92;%4 echo "etc..."
  exit
</pre>
<p>If this file is stored in your current directory as "commandfile", then:</p>
<pre>
  ./commandfile one two three four five
</pre>
<p>prints:</p>
<pre>
  Argument 1: one
  Argument 2: two
  Argument 3: three
  etc...
</pre>
<p>This illustrates the basic structure of a standalone Kermit script: the "kerbang line", then some commands. It should end with "exit" unless you want the Kermit prompt to appear when it is finished. &#92;%1 is the first argument, &#92;%2 the second, and so on.</p><p>You can also create your own commands by defining named macros composed of other Kermit commands (or macros). For example:</p>
<pre>
  define mydelete {
      local trash
      assign trash &#92;v(home)trashcan/
      if not defined &#92;%1 end 1 "Delete what?"
      if wild &#92;%1 {
          end 1 "Deleting multiple files is too scary"
      }
      if not exist &#92;%1 end 1 "I can't find &#92;%1"
      if not directory &#92;m(trash) {
          mkdir &#92;m(trash)
          if fail end 1 "No trash can"
      }
      rename /list &#92;%1 &#92;m(trash)
  }
  define myundelete {
      local trash
      assign trash &#92;v(home)trashcan/
      if not defined &#92;%1 end 1 "Undelete what?"
      if wild &#92;%1 {
          end 1 "Undeleting multiple files is too hard"
      }
      if not directory &#92;m(trash) end 1 "No trash can"
      if not exist &#92;m(trash)&#92;%1 {
          end 1 "I can't find &#92;%1 in trash can"
      }
      rename /list &#92;m(trash)&#92;%1 .
  }

</pre>
<p>These sample macros are not exactly production quality (they don't handle filenames that include path segments, they don't handle multiple files, etc), but you get the idea: you can pass arguments to macros, and they can check them and make other kinds of decisions. If you put the above lines into your initialization or customization file (explained below), you'll have MYDELETE and MYUNDELETE commands available every time you start Kermit, at least as long as you don't suppress execution of the initialization file. (Exercise for the reader: Make these macros generally useful: remove limitations, add trashcan display, browsing, emptying, etc.)</p><p>Kerbang scripts execute without the initialization file. This to keep them portable and also to make them start faster. If you want to write Kerbang scripts that depend on the initialization file, include the command</p>
<pre>
  take &#92;v(home).kermrc
</pre>
<p>at the desired spot in the script. By the way, &#92;v(xxx) is a built\(hyin variable (xxx is the variable name, "home" in this case). To see what built\(hyin variables are available, type "show variables" at the C\(hyKermit prompt. To see what else you can show, type "show ?". &#92;m(xxx) is a user defined variable (strictly speaking, it is a macro used as a variable).</p>
<h3>Command List</h3>
<p>C\(hyKermit has more than 200 top\(hylevel commands, and some of these, such as SET, branch off into hundreds of subcommands of their own, so it's not practical to describe them all here. Instead, here's a concise list of the most commonly used top\(hylevel commands, grouped by category. To learn about each command, type "help" followed by the command name, e.g. "help set". Terms such as Command state and Connect state are explained in subsequent sections.</p><p>Optional fields are shown in [ brackets ].  "filename" means the name of a single file. filespec means a file specification that is allowed to contain wildcard characters like '*' to match groups of files. options are (optional) switches like /PAGE, /NOPAGE, /QUIET, etc, listed in the HELP text for each command. Example:</p>
<pre>
  send /recursive /larger:10000 /after:-1week /except:*.txt *
</pre>
<p>which can be read as "send all the files in this directory and all the ones underneath it that are larger than 10000 bytes, no more than one week old, and whose names don't end with ".txt".</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">INITIALIZATION FILE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>In its default configuration, C\(hyKermit executes commands from a file called .kermrc in your home directory when it starts, unless it is given the -Y or -y command\(hyline option. Custom configurations might substitute a shared system\(hywide initialization file. The SHOW FILE command tells what initialization file, if any, was used. The standard initialization file "chains" to an individual customization file, .mykermc, in the home directory, in which each user can establish her/his own preferences, define macros, and so on.</p><p>Since execution of the initialization file (at least the standard one) makes C\(hyKermit take longer to start, it might be better not to have an initialization file, especially now that Kermit's default startup configuration is well attuned to modern computing and networking \(hy\(hy in other words, you no longer have do anything special to make Kermit transfers go fast. So instead of having an initialization file that is executed every time Kermit starts, you might consider making one or more kerbang scripts (with names other that .kermrc) that do NOT include an "exit" command, and invoke those when you need the settings, macro definitions, and/or scripted actions they contain, and invoke C\(hyKermit directly when you don't.</p><p>To put it another way... We still distribute the standard initialization file since it's featured in the manual and backwards compatibility is important to us. But there's no harm in not using it if you don't need the stuff that's in it (services directory, dialing directory, network directory, and associated macro definitions). On the other hand, if there are settings or macros you want in effect EVERY time you use Kermit, the initialization file (or the customization file it chains to) is the place to put them, because that's the only place Kermit looks for them automatically each time you start it.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">MODES OF OPERATION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Kermit is said to be in Local mode if it has made a connection to another computer, e.g. by dialing it or establishing a Telnet connection to it. The other computer is remote, so if you start another copy of Kermit on the remote computer, it is said to be in Remote mode (as long as it has not made any connections of its own). The local Kermit communicates over the communications device or network connection, acting as a conduit between the the remote computer and your keyboard and screen. The remote Kermit is the file\(hytransfer partner to the local Kermit and communicates only through its standard input and output.</p><p>At any moment, a Kermit program can be in any of the following states. It's important to know what they are and how to change from one to the other.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>Command state</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>In this state, Kermit reads commands from:</p><p>&bull;	Your keyboard; or:</p><p>&bull;	A file, or:</p><p>&bull;	A macro definition.</p><p>You can exit from Command state back to Unix with the EXIT or QUIT command (same thing). You can enter Connect state with any of various commands (CONNECT, DIAL, TELNET, etc). You can enter file transfer state with commands like SEND, RECEIVE, and GET. You can enter Server state with the SERVER command. The TAKE command tells Kermit to read and execute commands from a file. The (perhaps implied) DO command tells Kermit to read and execute commands from a macro definition. While in Command state, you can interrupt any command, macro, or command file by typing Ctrl-C (hold down the Ctrl key and press the C key); this normally brings you back to the prompt.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Shell state</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You can invoke an inferior shell or external command from the Kermit command prompt by using the PUSH, RUN (!), EDIT, or BROWSE command. While the inferior shell or command is active, Kermit is suspended and does nothing. Return to Kermit Command state by exiting from the inferior shell or application.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Connect state</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>In this state, which can be entered only when in Local mode (i.e. when Kermit has made a connection to another computer), Kermit is acting as a terminal to the remote computer. Your keystrokes are sent to the remote computer and characters that arrive over the communication connection are displayed on your screen. This state is entered when you give a CONNECT, DIAL, TELNET, RLOGIN, or IKSD command. You can return to command state by logging out of the remote computer, or by typing:</p>
<pre>
  Ctrl-&#92;c
</pre>
<p>That is: Hold down the Ctrl key and press the backslash key, then let go of the Ctrl key and press the C key. This is called escaping back. Certain other escape\(hylevel commands are also provided; type Ctrl-&#92;? for a list. For example, you can enter Shell state with:</p>
<pre>
  Ctrl-&#92;!
</pre>
<p>To send a Ctrl-&#92; to the host while in Connect state, type two of them in a row. See HELP CONNECT and HELP SET ESCAPE for more info.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Local file\(hytransfer state</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>In this state, Kermit is sending packets back and forth with the other computer in order to transfer a file or accomplish some other file\(hyrelated task. And at the same time, it is displaying its progress on your screen and watching your keyboard for interruptions. In this state, the following single\(hykeystroke commands are accepted:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>X</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Interrupt the current file and go on to the next (if any).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Z</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Interrupt the current file and skip all the rest.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>E</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Like Z but uses a "stronger" protocol (use if X or Z don't work).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Ctrl-C</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Interrupt file\(hytransfer mode (use if Z or E don't work).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Kermit returns to its previous state (Command or Connect) when the transfer is complete or when interrupted successfully by X, Z, E, or Ctrl-C (hold down the Ctrl key and press the C key).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Remote file\(hytransfer state</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>In this state, Kermit is exchanging file\(hytransfer packets with its local partner over its standard i/o. It leaves this state automatically when the transfer is complete. In case you find your local Kermit in Connect state and the remote one in File\(hytransfer state (in which it seems to ignore your keystrokes), you can usually return it to command state by typing three Ctrl-C's in a row. If that doesn't work, return your local Kermit to Command state (Ctrl-&#92; C) and type "e\(hypacket" and then press the Return or Enter key; this forces a fatal Kermit protocol error.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Remote Server state</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is like Remote File\(hytransfer state, except it never returns automatically to Command state. Rather, it awaits further instructions from the client program; that is, from your Local Kermit program. You can return the Remote Server to its previous state by issuing a "finish" command to the client, or if you are in Connect state, by typing three Ctrl-C's in a row. You can tell the server job to log out and break the connection by issuing a "bye" command to the client.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Local Server state</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Like Remote\(hyServer state, but in local mode, and therefore with its file\(hytransfer display showing, and listening for single\(hykey commands, as in Local File\(hytransfer state. Usually this state is entered automatically when a remote Kermit program gives a GET command.</p><p>C\(hyKermit, Kermit 95, and MS\(hyDOS Kermit all can switch automatically from Connect state to Local File\(hytransfer state when you initiate a file transfer from the remote computer by starting Kermit and telling it to send or get a file, in which case, Connect state is automatically resumed after the file transfer is finished.</p><p>Note that C\(hyKermit is not a terminal emulator. It is a communications application that you run in a terminal window (e.g. console or Xterm). The specific emulation, such as VT100, VT220, Linux Console, or Xterm, is provided by the terminal window in which you are running C\(hyKermit. Kermit 95 and MS\(hyDOS Kermit, on the other hand, are true terminal emulators. Why is C\(hyKermit not a terminal emulator? CLICK HERE to read about it.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Here is how to make different kinds of connections using interactive Kermit commands (as noted above, you can also make connections with command\(hyline options). Note that you don't have to make connections with Kermit. It can also be used on the far end of a connection as the remote file transfer and management partner of your local communications software.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>Making a Telnet Connection</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>At the C\(hyKermit command prompt, simply type:</p>
<pre>
  telnet foo.bar.com
</pre>
<p>(substituting desired hostname or address). You can also include a port number:</p>
<pre>
  telnet xyzcorp.com 3000 ;
</pre>
<p>If the connection is successful, Kermit automically enters Connect state. When you logout from the remote host, Kermit automatically returns to its prompt. More info: HELP TELNET, HELP SET TELNET, HELP SET TELOPT. Also see the IKSD section below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Making an Rlogin connection</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Making an SSH Connection</p>

  <dt>
    <p>Dialing with a Modem</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If it's an external modem, make sure it is connected to a usable serial port on your computer with a regular (straight\(hythrough) modem cable, and to the telephone jack with a telephone cable, and that it's turned on. Then use these commands:</p>
<pre>
  set modem type usrobotics  ; Or other supported type
  set line /dev/ttyS0        ; Specify device name
  set speed 57600            ; Or other desired speed
  set flow rts/cts           ; Most modern modems support this
  set dial method tone       ; (or pulse)
  dial 7654321               ; Dial the desired number
</pre>
<p>Type "set modem type ?" for a list of supported modem types. If you omit the SET MODEM TYPE command, the default type is "generic\(hyhigh\(hyspeed", which should work for most modern AT\(hycommand\(hyset modems. If the line is busy, Kermit redials automatically. If the call does not succeed, use "set dial display on" and try it again to watch what happens. If the call succeeds, Kermit enters Connect state automatically and returns to its prompt automatically when you log out from the remote computer or the connection is otherwise lost.</p><p>You can also dial from a modem that is accessible by Telnet, e.g. to a reverse terminal server. In this case the command sequence is:</p>
<pre>
  set host ts.xxx.com 2000   ; Terminal\(hyserver and port
  set modem type usrobotics  ; Or other supported type
  set dial method tone       ; (or pulse)
  dial 7654321               ; Dial the desired number
</pre>
<p>If the terminal server supports the Telnet Com Port Option, RFC 2217, you can also give serial\(hyport related commands such as SET SPEED, SET PARITY, and so on, and Kermit relays them to the terminal server using the protocol specified in the RFC.</p><p>More info: HELP SET MODEM, HELP SET LINE, HELP SET SPEED, HELP SET FLOW, HELP DIAL, HELP SET DIAL, HELP SET MODEM, HELP SET CARRIER-WATCH, SHOW COMMUNICATIONS, SHOW MODEM, SHOW DIAL.</p>
  </dd>

    <p>Direct Serial Port</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Connect the two computers, A and B, with a null modem cable (or two modem cables interconnected with a null\(hymodem adapter or modem eliminator). From Computer A:</p>
<pre>
  set modem type none   ; There is no modem

  set carrier-watch off ; If DTR CD are not cross\(hyconnected

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">TRANSFERRING FILES WITH KERMIT</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>There is a widespread and persistent belief that Kermit is a slow protocol. This is because, until recently, it used conservative tuning by default to make sure file transfers succeeded, rather than failing because they overloaded the connection. Some extra commands (or command\(hyline options, like -Q) were needed to make it go fast, but nobody bothered to find out about them. Also, it takes two to tango: most non\(hyKermit\(hyProject Kermit protocol implementations really ARE slow. The best file\(hytransfer partners for C\(hyKermit are: another copy of C\(hyKermit (7.0 or later) and Kermit 95. These combinations work well and they work fast by default. MS\(hyDOS Kermit is good too, but you have to tell it to go fast (by giving it the FAST command).</p><p>Furthermore, all three of these Kermit programs support "autodownload" and "autoupload", meaning that when they are in Connect state and a Kermit packet comes in from the remote, they automatically switch into file transfer mode.</p><p>And plus, C\(hyKermit and K95 also switch automatically between text and binary mode for each file, so there is no need to "set file type binary" or "set file type text", or to worry about files being corrupted because they were transferred in the wrong mode.</p><p>What all of these words add up to is that now, when you use up\(hyto\(hydate Kermit software from the Kermit Project, file transfer is not only fast, it's ridiculously easy. You barely have to give any commands at all.</p>

    <p>Downloading Files</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Let's say you have Kermit 95, C\(hyKermit, or MS\(hyDOS Kermit on your desktop computer, with a connection to a Unix computer that has C\(hyKermit installed as "kermit". To download a file (send it from Unix to your desktop computer), just type the following command at your Unix shell prompt:</p>
<pre>
  kermit -s oofa.txt
</pre>
<p>(where oofa.txt is the filename). If you want to send more than one file, you can put as many filenames as you want on the command line, and they can be any combination of text and binary:</p>
<pre>
  kermit -s oofa.txt oofa.zip oofa.html oofa.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>and/or you can use wildcards to send groups of files:</p>
<pre>
  kermit -s oofa.*
</pre>
<p>If you want to send a file under an assumed name, use:</p>
<pre>
  kermit -s friday.txt -a today.txt
</pre>
<p>This sends the file friday.txt but tells the receiving Kermit that its name is today.txt. In all cases, as noted, when the file transfer is finished, your desktop Kermit returns automatically to Connect state. No worries about escaping back, re\(hyconnecting, text/binary mode switching. Almost too easy, right?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Uploading Files</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>To upload files (send them from your desktop computer to the remote Unix computer) do the same thing, but use the -g (GET) option instead of -s:</p>
<pre>
  kermit -g oofa.txt
</pre>
<p>This causes your local Kermit to enter server mode; then the remote Kermit program requests the named file and the local Kermit sends it and returns automatically to Connect state when done.</p><p>If you want to upload multiple files, you have have use shell quoting rules, since these aren't local files:</p>
<pre>
  kermit -g "oofa.txt oofa.zip oofa.html oofa.tar.gz"
  kermit -g "oofa.*"
</pre>
<p>If you want to upload a file but store it under a different name, use:</p>
<pre>
  kermit -g friday.txt -a today.txt
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Kermit Transfers the Old\(hyFashioned Way</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If your desktop communications software does not support autoupload or autodownload, or it does not include Kermit server mode, the procedure requires more steps.</p><p>To download a file, type:</p>
<pre>
  kermit -s filename
</pre>
<p>on the host as before, but if nothing happens automatically in response to this command, you have to switch your desktop communications software into Kermit Receive state. This might be done by escaping back using keyboard characters or hot keys (Alt-x is typical) and/or with a command (like RECEIVE) or a menu. When the file transfer is complete, you have to go back to Connect state, Terminal emulation, or whatever terminology applies to your desktop communications software.</p><p>To upload a file, type:</p>
<pre>
  kermit -r
</pre>
<p>on the host (rather than "kermit -g"). This tells C\(hyKermit to wait passively for a file to start arriving. Then regain the attention of your desktop software (Alt-x or whatever) and instruct it to send the desired file(s) with Kermit protocol. When the transfer is finished, return to the Connect or Terminal screen.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>If File Transfer Fails</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Although every aspect of Kermit's operation can be finely tuned, there are also three short and simple "omnibus tuning" commands you can use for troubleshooting:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>FAST</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use fast file\(hytransfer settings. This has been the default since C\(hyKermit 7.0 now that most modern computers and connections support it. If transfers fail with fast settings, try . . .</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>CAUTIOUS</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use cautious but not paranoid settings. File transfers, if they work, will go at medium speed. If not, try . . .</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>ROBUST</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use the most robust, resilient, conservative, safe, and reliable settings. File transfers will almost certainly work, but they will be quite slow (of course this is a classic tradeoff; ROBUST was C\(hyKermit's default tuning in versions 6.0 and earlier, which made everybody think Kermit protocol was slow). If ROBUST doesn't do the trick, try again with SET PARITY SPACE first in case it's not an 8\(hybit connection.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Obviously the success and performance of a file transfer also depends on C\(hyKermit's file transfer partner. Up\(hyto\(hydate, real Kermit Project partners are recommended because they contain the best Kermit protocol implementations and because we can support them in case of trouble.</p><p>If you still have trouble, consult Chapter 10 of Using C\(hyKermit, or send email to kermit\(hysupport@columbia.edu.</p>

    <p>You can also use C\(hyKermit to transfer files with FTP or HTTP Internet protocols; see below.</p><p>On a regular serial or Telnet connection where the other computer doesn't support Kermit protocol at all, you have several options. For example, if your desktop communications software supports Zmodem, use "rz" and "sz" on the host rather than Kermit. But if Kermit is your desktop software, and you are using it to make calls or network connections to other computers that don't support Kermit protocol (or that don't have a good implementation of it), then if your computer also has external X, Y, or Zmodem programs that are redirectable, Kermit can use them as external protocols. HELP SET PROTOCOL for details.</p><p>You can also capture "raw" data streams from the other computer with LOG SESSION (HELP LOG and HELP SET SESSION-LOG for details), and you can upload files without any protocol at all with TRANSMIT (HELP TRANSMIT, HELP SET TRANSMIT).</p>

</pre>
<p>You also can use HELP FTP and HELP SET FTP to get descriptions of Kermit's FTP\(hyrelated commands.</p><p>The HTTP client is similar to the FTP one, except you prefix each command with HTTP instead of FTP: HTTP OPEN, HTTP GET, HTTP PUT, HTTP CLOSE, etc. Type HELP HTTP for details, or visit the to view the manual supplements. HTTP connections can be open at the same time as regular serial or Telnet connections and FTP connections. So Kermit can manage up to three types connections simultaneously.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">INTERNET KERMIT SERVICE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>C\(hyKermit can be configured and run as an Internet service (called IKSD), similar to an FTP server (FTPD) except you can (but need not) interact with it directly, plus it does a lot more than an FTP server can do. The TCP port for IKSD is 1649. It uses Telnet protocol. C\(hyKermit can be an Internet Kermit Server, or it can be a client of an IKSD. You can make connections from C\(hyKermit to an IKSD with any of the following commands:</p>
<pre>
  telnet foo.bar.edu 1649
  telnet foo.bar.edu kermit   ; if "kermit" is listed in /etc/services
  iksd foo.bar.edu
</pre>
<p>The IKSD command is equivalent to a TELNET command specifying port 1649. For more information about making and using connections to an IKSD, see:</p>
<pre>
  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/cuiksd.html
</pre>
<p>You can run an Internet Kermit Service on your own computer too (if you are the system administrator). For instructions, see:</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">ALTERNATIVE COMMAND\(hyLINE PERSONALITIES</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>When invoked as "kermit" or any other name besides "ftp" or "telnet", C\(hyKermit has the command\(hyline options described above in the OPTIONS section. However, if you invoke C\(hyKermit as "telnet" or "ftp", it changes its command\(hyline personality to match. This can be done (among other ways) with symbolic links (symlinks). For example, if you want C\(hyKermit to be your regular Telnet client, or the Telnet helper of your Web browser, you can create a link like the following in a directory that lies in your PATH ahead of the regular telnet program:</p>
<pre>
  ln -s /usr/local/bin/kermit telnet
</pre>
<p>Now when you give a "telnet" command, you are invoking Kermit instead, but with its Telnet command\(hyline personality so, for example:</p>
<pre>
  telnet xyzcorp.com
</pre>
<p>Makes a Telnet connection to xyzcorp.com, and Kermit exits automatically when the connection is closed (just like the regular Telnet client). Type "telnet -h" to get a list of Kermit's Telnet\(hypersonality command\(hyline options, which are intended to be as compatible as possible with the regular Telnet client.</p><p>Similarly for FTP:</p>
<pre>
  ln -s /usr/local/bin/kermit ftp
</pre>
<p>And now type "ftp -h" to see its command\(hyline options, and command lines just like you would give your regular FTP client:</p>
<pre>
  ftp xyzcorp.com
</pre>
<p>but with additional options allowing an entire session to be specified on the command line. Finally, if Kermit's first command\(hyline option is a Telnet, FTP, IKSD, or HTTP URL, Kermit automatically makes the appropriate kind of connection and, if indicated by the URL, takes the desired action:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
