        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>xorriso</strong> is a program which copies file objects from POSIX compliant filesystems into Rock Ridge enhanced ISO 9660 filesystems and allows session-wise manipulation of such filesystems. It can load the management information of existing ISO images and it writes the session results to optical media or to filesystem objects.</p><p>Vice versa <strong>xorriso</strong> is able to copy file objects out of ISO 9660 filesystems.</p><p>A special property of <strong>xorriso</strong> is that it needs neither an external ISO 9660 formatter program nor an external burn program for CD, DVD or BD but rather incorporates the libraries of libburnia-project.org .</p><h3></h3>
<p><strong>Overview of features:</strong></p><p>Operates on an existing ISO image or creates a new one.</p><p>Copies files from disk filesystem into the ISO image.</p><p>Copies files from ISO image to disk filesystem (see osirrox).</p><p>Renames or deletes file objects in the ISO image.</p><p>Changes file properties in the ISO image.</p><p>Updates ISO subtrees incrementally to match given disk subtrees.</p><p>Writes result either as completely new image or as add-on session to optical media or filesystem objects.</p><p>Can activate ISOLINUX and GRUB boot images via El Torito and MBR.</p><p>Can perform multi-session tasks as emulation of mkisofs and cdrecord.</p><p>Can record and restore hard links and ACL.</p><p>Content may get zisofs compressed or filtered by external processes.</p><p>Can issue commands to mount older sessions on GNU/Linux or FreeBSD.</p><p>Can check media for damages and copy readable blocks to disk.</p><p>Can attach MD5 checksums to each data file and the whole session.</p><p>Scans for optical drives, blanks re-useable optical media.</p><p>Reads its instructions from command line arguments, dialog, and files.</p><p>Provides navigation commands for interactive ISO image manipulation.</p><p>Adjustable thresholds for abort, exit value, and problem reporting.</p><p>Note that <strong>xorriso</strong> does not write audio CDs and that it does not produce UDF filesystems which are specified for official video DVD or BD.</p>

<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Session model:</strong></p><p>Unlike other filesystems, <strong>ISO 9660</strong> (aka <strong>ECMA-119</strong>) is not intended for read-write operation but rather for being generated in a single sweep and being written to media as a <strong>session</strong>.</p><p>The data content of the session is called filesystem <strong>image</strong>.</p><p>The written image in its session can then be mounted by the operating system for being used read-only. GNU/Linux is able to mount ISO images from block devices, which may represent optical media, other media or via a loop device even from regular disk files. FreeBSD mounts ISO images from devices that represent arbitrary media or from regular disk files.</p><p>This session usage model has been extended on CD media by the concept of <strong>multi-session</strong> , which allows to add information to the CD and gives the mount programs of the operating systems the addresses of the entry points of each session. The mount programs recognize block devices which represent CD media and will by default mount the image in the last session.</p><p>This session usually contains an updated directory tree for the whole medium which governs the data contents in all recorded sessions. So in the view of the mount program all sessions of a particular medium together form a single filesystem image.</p><p>Adding a session to an existing ISO image is in this text referred as <strong>growing</strong>.</p><p>The multi-session model of the MMC standard does not apply to all media types. But program growisofs by Andy Polyakov showed how to extend this functionality to overwriteable media or disk files which carry valid ISO 9660 filesystems.</p><p><strong>xorriso</strong> provides growing as well as an own method named <strong>modifying</strong> which produces a completely new ISO image from the old one and the modifications. See paragraph Creating, Growing, Modifying, Blind Growing below.</p><p><strong>xorriso</strong> adopts the concept of multi-session by loading an image directory tree if present, by allowing to manipulate it by several actions, and by writing the new image to the target medium.</p><p>The first session of a <strong>xorriso</strong> run begins by the definition of the input drive with the ISO image or by the definition of an output drive. The session ends by command -commit which triggers writing. A -commit is done automatically when the program ends regularly.</p><p>After -commit a new session begins with the freshly written one as input. A new input drive can only be chosen as long as the loaded ISO image was not altered. Pending alteration can be revoked by command -rollback.</p><p>Writing a session to the target is supposed to be very expensive in terms of time and of consumed space on appendable or write-once media. Therefore all intended manipulations of a particular ISO image should be done in a single session. But in principle it is possible to store intermediate states and to continue with image manipulations.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Media types and states:</strong> There are two families of media in the MMC standard:</p><p><strong>Multi-session media</strong> are CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD+R/DL, BD-R, and unformatted DVD-RW. These media provide a table of content which describes their existing sessions. See command <strong>-toc</strong>.</p><p>Similar to multi-session media are DVD-R DL and minimally blanked DVD-RW. They allow only a single session of which the size must be known in advance. <strong>xorriso</strong> will write onto them only if command -close is set to "on".</p><p><strong>Overwriteable media</strong> are DVD-RAM, DVD+RW, BD-RE, and formatted DVD-RW. They allow random write access but do not provide information about their session history. If they contain one or more ISO 9660 sessions and if the first session was written by <strong>xorriso</strong>, then a table of content can be emulated. Else only a single overall session will be visible.</p><p>DVD-RW media can be formatted by -format "full". They can be made unformatted by -blank "deformat".</p><p>Regular files and block devices are handled as overwriteable media. Pipes and other writeable file types are handled as blank multi-session media.</p><p>These media can assume several states in which they offer different capabilities.</p><p><strong>Blank</strong> media can be written from scratch. They contain no ISO image suitable for <strong>xorriso</strong>.</p><p>Blank is the state of newly purchased optical media. With used CD-RW and DVD-RW it can be achieved by action -blank "as_needed". Overwriteable media are considered blank if they are new or if they have been marked as blank by <strong>xorriso</strong>. Action -blank "as_needed" can be used to do this marking on overwriteable media, or to apply mandatory formatting to new media if necessary.</p><p><strong>Appendable</strong> media accept further sessions. Either they are MMC multi-session media in appendable state, or they are overwriteable media which contain an ISO image suitable for <strong>xorriso</strong>.</p><p>Appendable is the state after writing a session with command -close off.</p><p><strong>Closed</strong> media cannot be written. They may contain an ISO image suitable for <strong>xorriso</strong>.</p><p>Closed is the state of DVD-ROM media and of multi-session media which were written with command -close on. If the drive is read-only hardware then it will probably show any media as closed CD-ROM resp. DVD-ROM.</p><p>Overwriteable media assume this state in such read-only drives or if they contain unrecognizable data in the first 32 data blocks.</p><p>Read-only drives may or may not show session histories of multi-session media. Often only the first and the last session are visible. Sometimes not even that. Command -rom_toc_scan might or might not help in such cases.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Creating, Growing, Modifying, Blind Growing:</strong></p><p>A new empty ISO image gets <strong>created</strong> if there is no input drive with a valid ISO 9660 image when the first time an output drive is defined. This is achieved by command -dev on blank media or by command -outdev on media in any state.</p><p>The new empty image can be populated with directories and files. Before it can be written, the medium in the output drive must get into blank state if it was not blank already.</p><p>If there is a input drive with a valid ISO image, then this image gets loaded as foundation for manipulations and extension. The constellation of input and output drive determines which write method will be used. They have quite different capabilities and constraints.</p><p>The method of <strong>growing</strong> adds new data to the existing data on the medium. These data comprise of new file content and they override the existing ISO 9660 + Rock Ridge directory tree. It is possible to hide files from previous sessions but they still exist on the medium and with many types of optical media it is quite easy to recover them by mounting older sessions.</p><p>Growing is achieved by command -dev.</p><p>The write method of <strong>modifying</strong> produces compact filesystem images with no outdated files or directory trees. Modifying can write its images to target media which are completely unsuitable for multi-session operations. E.g. DVD-RW which were treated with -blank deformat_quickest, DVD-R DL, named pipes, character devices, sockets. On the other hand modified sessions cannot be written to appendable media but to blank media only.</p><p>So for this method one needs either two optical drives or has to work with filesystem objects as source and/or target medium.</p><p>Modifying takes place if input drive and output drive are not the same and if command -grow_blindly is set to its default "off". This is achieved by commands -indev and -outdev.</p><p>If command -grow_blindly is set to a non-negative number and if -indev and -outdev are both set to different drives, then <strong>blind growing</strong> is performed. It produces an add-on session which is ready for being written to the given block address. This is the usage model of</p><p> mkisofs -M $indev -C $msc1,$msc2 -o $outdev</p><p>which gives much room for wrong parameter combinations and should thus only be employed if a strict distinction between ISO formatter <strong>xorriso</strong> and the burn program is desired. -C $msc1,$msc2 is equivalent to:</p><p> -load sbsector $msc1 -grow_blindly $msc2</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Libburn drives:</strong></p><p>Input drive, i.e. source of an existing or empty ISO image, can be any random access readable libburn drive: optical media with readable data, blank optical media, regular files, block devices.</p><p>Output drive, i.e. target for writing, can be any libburn drive. Some drive types do not support the method of growing but only the methods of modifying and blind growing. They all are suitable for newly created images.</p><p>All drive file objects have to offer rw-permission to the user of <strong>xorriso</strong>. Even those which will not be useable for reading an ISO image.</p><p>MMC compliant (i.e. optical) drives on GNU/Linux usually get addressed by the path of their block device or of their generic character device. E.g.</p>
<pre>
  -dev /dev/sr0
</pre>

<pre>
  -dev /dev/hdc
</pre>

<pre>
  -dev /dev/sg2
</pre>
<p>On FreeBSD the device files have names like</p>
<pre>
  -dev /dev/cd0
</pre>
<p>On OpenSolaris:</p>
<pre>
  -dev /dev/rdsk/c4t0d0s2
</pre>
<p>Get a list of accessible drives by command</p>
<pre>
  -device_links
</pre>
<p>It might be necessary to do this as <strong>superuser</strong> in order to see all drives and to then allow rw-access for the intended users. Consider to bundle the authorized users in a group like old "floppy".</p><p>Filesystem objects of nearly any type can be addressed by prefix "stdio:" and their path in the filesystem. E.g.:</p>
<pre>
  -dev stdio:/dev/sdc
</pre>
<p>The default setting of -drive_class allows to address files outside the /dev tree without that prefix. E.g.:</p>
<pre>
  -dev /tmp/pseudo_drive
</pre>
<p>If path leads to a regular file or to a block device then the emulated drive is random access readable and can be used for the method of growing if it already contains a valid ISO 9660 image. Any other file type is not readable via "stdio:" and can only be used as target for the method of modifying or blind growing. Non-existing paths in existing directories are handled as empty regular files.</p><p>A very special kind of pseudo drive are open file descriptors. They are depicted by "stdio:/dev/fd/" and descriptor number (see man 2 open).</p><p>Addresses "-" or "stdio:/dev/fd/1" depict standard output, which normally is the output channel for result texts. To prevent a fatal intermingling of ISO image and text messages, all result texts get redirected to stderr if -*dev "-" or "stdio:/dev/fd/1" is among the start arguments of the program.</p><p>Standard output is currently suitable for creating one session per program run without dialog. Use in other situations is discouraged and several restrictions apply:</p><p>It is not allowed to use standard output as pseudo drive if it was not among the start arguments. Do not try to fool this ban via backdoor addresses to stdout.</p><p>If stdout is used as drive, then -use_readline is permanently disabled. Use of backdoors can cause severe memory and/or tty corruption.</p><p>Be aware that especially the superuser can write into any accessible file or device by using its path with the "stdio:" prefix. By default any address in the /dev tree without prefix "stdio:" will work only if it leads to a MMC drive.</p><p>One may use command <strong>-ban_stdio_write</strong> to surely prevent this risk and to allow only MMC drives.</p><p>One may prepend "mmc:" to a path to surely disallow any automatic "stdio:".</p><p>By command -drive_class one may ban certain paths or allow access without prefix "stdio:" to other paths.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Rock Ridge, POSIX, X/Open, El Torito, ACL, xattr:</strong></p><p><strong>Rock Ridge</strong> is the name of a set of additional information which enhance an ISO 9660 filesystem so that it can represent a POSIX compliant filesystem with ownership, access permissions, symbolic links, and other attributes.</p><p>This is what <strong>xorriso</strong> uses for a decent representation of the disk files within the ISO image. <strong>xorriso</strong> produces Rock Ridge information by default. It is strongly discouraged to disable this feature.</p><p><strong>xorriso</strong> is not named "porriso" because POSIX only guarantees 14 characters of filename length. It is the X/Open System Interface standard XSI which demands a file name length of up to 255 characters and paths of up to 1024 characters. Rock Ridge fulfills this demand.</p><p>An <strong>El Torito</strong> boot record points the BIOS bootstrapping facility to one or more boot images, which are binary program files stored in the ISO image. The content of the boot image files is not in the scope of El Torito.</p><p>Most bootable GNU/Linux CDs are equipped with ISOLINUX or GRUB boot images. <strong>xorriso</strong> is able to create or maintain an El Torito object which makes such an image bootable. For details see command -boot_image.</p><p>It is possible to make ISO images bootable from USB stick or other hard-disk-like media. Several options install a <strong>MBR</strong> (Master Boot Record), It may get adjusted according to the needs of the intended boot firmware and the involved boot loaders, e.g. GRUB2 or ISOLINUX. A MBR contains boot code and a partition table. The new MBR of a follow-up session can get in effect only on overwriteable media.</p><p>MBR is read by PC-BIOS when booting from USB stick or hard disk, and by PowerPC CHRP or PReP when booting. An MBR partiton with type 0xee indicates the presence of GPT.</p><p>Emulation -as mkisofs supports the example options out of the ISOLINUX wiki, the options used in GRUB script grub-mkrescue, and the example in the FreeBSD AvgLiveCD wiki.</p><p>A <strong>GPT</strong> (GUID Partition Table) marks partitions in a more modern way. It is read by EFI when booting from USB stick or hard disk, and may be used for finding and mounting a HFS+ partition inside the ISO image.</p><p>An <strong>APM</strong> (Apple Partition Map) marks the HFS+ partition. It is read by Macs for booting and for mounting.</p><p>MBR, GPT and APM are combinable. APM occupies the first 8 bytes of MBR boot code. All three do not hamper El Torito booting from CDROM.</p><p>There is support for further facilities: MIPS Big Endian (SGI), MIPS Little Endian (DEC), SUN SPARC. Those are mutually not combinable and also not combinable with MBR, GPT, or APM.</p><p><strong>ACL</strong> are an advanced way of controlling access permissions to file objects. Neither ISO 9660 nor Rock Ridge specify a way to record ACLs. So libisofs has introduced a standard conformant extension named AAIP for that purpose. It uses this extension if enabled by command <strong>-acl</strong>.</p><p>AAIP enhanced images are supposed to be mountable normally, but one cannot expect that the mounted filesystem will show and respect the ACLs. For now, only <strong>xorriso</strong> is able to retrieve those ACLs. It can bring them into effect when files get restored to an ACL enabled file system or it can print them in a format suitable for tool setfacl.</p><p>Files with ACL show as group permissions the setting of entry "mask::" if that entry exists. Nevertheless the non-listed group members get handled according to entry "group::". When removing ACL from a file, <strong>xorriso</strong> brings "group::" into effect.</p><p>Recording and restoring of ACLs from and to local files works currently only on GNU/Linux and FreeBSD.</p><p><strong>xattr</strong> (aka EA, or extattr) are pairs of name and value which can be attached to file objects. AAIP is able to represent them and <strong>xorriso</strong> allows to record and restore pairs which have names out of the user namespace. I.e. those which begin with "user.", like "user.x" or "user.whatever". Name has to be a 0 terminated string. Value may be any array of bytes which does not exceed the size of 4095 bytes. xattr processing happens only if it is enabled by command <strong>-xattr</strong>.</p><p>As with ACL, currently only <strong>xorriso</strong> is able to retrieve xattr from AAIP enhanced images, to restore them to xattr capable file systems, or to print them.</p><p>Recording and restoring of xattr from and to local files works currently only on GNU/Linux and FreeBSD, where they are known as extattr.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Command processing:</strong></p><p>Commands are either actions which happen immediately or settings which influence following actions. So their sequence does matter, unless they are given as program arguments and command <strong>-x</strong> is among them.</p><p>Commands consist of a command word, followed by zero or more parameter words. If the list of parameter words is of variable length (indicated by "[...]" or "[***]") then it must be terminated by either the <strong>list delimiter</strong>, occur at the end of the argument list, or occur at the end of an input line.</p><p>At program start the list delimiter is the string "--". This may be changed with the -list_delimiter command in order to allow "--" as parameter in a variable length list. However, it is advised to reset the delimiter to "--" immediately afterwards.</p><p>For brevity the list delimiter is referred as "--" throughout this text.</p><p>The list delimiter is silently ignored if it appears after the parameters of a command with a fixed list length. It is handled as normal text if it appears among the parameters of such a command.</p><p><strong>Pattern expansion</strong> converts a list of pattern words into a list of existing file addresses. Unmatched pattern words will appear unaltered in that result list.</p><p>Pattern matching supports the usual shell parser wildcards '*' '?' '[xyz]' and respects '/' as the path separator, which may only be matched literally.</p><p>Pattern expansion is a property of some particular commands and not a general feature. It is controlled by commands -iso_rr_pattern and -disk_pattern. Commands which use pattern expansion all have variable parameter lists which are specified in this text by "[***]" rather than "[...]".</p><p>Some other commands perform pattern matching unconditionally.</p><p>Command and parameter words are either read from the program arguments, where one argument is one word, or from quoted input lines where words are recognized similar to the quotation rules of a shell parser.</p><p><strong>xorriso</strong> is not a shell, although it might appear so at first glimpse. Be aware that the interaction of quotation marks and pattern symbols like "*" differs from the usual shell parsers. In <strong>xorriso</strong>, a quotation mark does not make a pattern symbol literal.</p><p><strong>Quoted input</strong> converts whitespace-separated text into words. The double quotation mark " and the single quotation mark ' can be used to enclose whitespace and make it part of words (e.g. of file names). Each mark type can enclose the marks of the other type. A trailing backslash nbsp;outside quotations or an open quotation cause the next input line to be appended.</p><p>Quoted input accepts any 8-bit character except NUL (0) as the content of the quotes. Nevertheless it can be cumbersome for the user to produce those characters directly. Therefore quoted input and program arguments allow optional <strong>Backslash Interpretation</strong> which can represent all 8-bit characters except NUL (0) via backslash codes as in $'...' of bash.</p><p>This is not enabled by default. See command -backslash_codes.</p><p>When the program starts then it first looks for argument -no_rc. If this is not present then it looks for its startup files and reads their content as command input lines. Then it interprets the program arguments as commands and parameters. Finally it enters dialog mode if command -dialog "on" has been executed by this point.</p><p>The program ends either by command -end, or by the end of program arguments if dialog mode has not been enabled at that point, or by a problem event which triggers the threshold of command -abort_on.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Dialog, Readline, Result pager:</strong></p><p>Dialog mode prompts for a quoted input line, parses it into words, and performs them as commands with their parameters. It provides assisting services to make dialog more comfortable.</p><p>Readline is an enhancement for the input line. You may already know it from the bash shell.

    <p><strong>-outdev</strong> address</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set output drive and if it differs from the input drive then switch from growing to modifying or to blind growing. Unlike -dev and -indev this action does not load a new ISO image. So it can be performed even if there are pending changes.</p><p>-outdev can be performed without previous -dev or -indev. In that case an empty ISO image with no changes pending is created. It can either be populated by help of -map, -add et.al. or it can be discarded silently if -dev or -indev are performed afterwards.</p><p>Special address string "-" means standard output, to which several restrictions apply.

    <p><strong>-load</strong> entity id</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Load a particular (possibly outdated) ISO session from -dev or -indev. Usually all available sessions are shown with command -toc.</p><p>entity depicts the kind of addressing. id depicts the particular address. The following entities are defined:</p><p>"auto" with any id addresses the last session in -toc. This is the default.</p><p>"session" with id being a number as of a line "ISO session", column "Idx".</p><p>"track" with id being a number as of a line "ISO track", column "Idx".</p><p>"lba" or "sbsector" with a number as of a line "ISO ...", column "sbsector".</p><p>"volid" with a search pattern for a text as of a line "ISO ...", column "Volume Id".</p><p>Adressing a non-existing entity or one which does not represent an ISO image will either abandon -indev or at least lead to a blank image.</p><p>If an input drive is set at the moment when -load is executed, then the addressed ISO image is loaded immediately. Else, the setting will be pending until the next -dev or -indev. After the image has been loaded once, the setting is valid for -rollback until next -dev or -indev, where it will be reset to "auto".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-displacement</strong> [-]lba</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Compensate a displacement of the image versus the start address for which the image was prepared. This affects only loading of ISO images and reading of their files. The multi-session method of growing is not allowed as long as -displacement is non-zero. I.e. -indev and -outdev must be different. The displacement gets reset to 0 before the drive gets re-acquired after writing.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>If a track of a CD starts at block 123456 and gets copied to a disk file where it begins at block 0, then this copy can be loaded with -displacement -123456.</p><p>If an ISO image was written onto a partition with offset of 640000 blocks of 512 bytes, then it can be loaded from the base device by -displacement 160000.</p><p>In both cases, the ISO sessions should be self contained, i.e. not add-on sessions to an ISO image outside their track resp. partition.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-drive_class</strong> "harmless"|"banned"|"caution"|"clear_list" disk_pattern</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Add a drive path pattern to one of the safety lists or make those lists empty. There are three lists defined which get tested in the following sequence:</p><p>If a drive address path matches the "harmless" list then the drive will be accepted. If it is not a MMC device then the prefix "stdio:" will be prepended automatically. This list is empty by default.</p><p>Else if the path matches the "banned" list then the drive will not be accepted by <strong>xorriso</strong> but rather lead to a FAILURE event. This list is empty by default.</p><p>Else if the path matches the "caution" list and if it is not a MMC device, then its address must have the prefix "stdio:" or it will be rejected. This list has by default one entry: "/dev".</p><p>If a drive path matches no list then it is considered "harmless". By default these are all paths which do not begin with directory "/dev".</p><p>A path matches a list if one of its parent paths or itself matches a list entry. Address prefix "stdio:" or "mmc:" will be ignored when testing for matches.</p><p>By pseudo-class "clear_list" and pseudo-patterns "banned", "caution", "harmless", or "all", the lists may be made empty.</p><p>E.g.: -drive_class clear_list banned</p><p>One will normally define the -drive_class lists in one of the <strong>xorriso</strong> Startup Files.</p><p>Note: This is not a security feature but rather a bumper for the superuser to prevent inadverted mishaps. For reliably blocking access to a device file you have to deny its rw-permissions in the filesystem.</p>

    <p>Refuse to load ISO images with volume IDs which do not match the given search pattern. When refusing an image, give up the input drive and issue an event of the given severity (like FAILURE, see -abort_on).

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-auto_charset</strong> "on"|"off"</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable or disable recording and interpretation of the output character set name in an xattr attribute of the image root directory. If enabled and if a recorded character set name is found, then this name will be used as name of the input character set when reading an image.</p><p>Note that the default output charset is the local character set of the terminal where <strong>xorriso</strong> runs. Before attributing this local character set to the produced ISO image, check whether the terminal properly displays all intended filenames, especially exotic national characters.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-hardlinks</strong> mode[:mode...]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable or disable loading and recording of hardlink relations.</p><p>In default mode "off", iso_rr files lose their inode numbers at image load time. Each iso_rr file object which has no inode number at image generation time will get a new unique inode number if -compliance is set to new_rr.</p><p>Mode "on" preserves inode numbers from the loaded image if such numbers were recorded. When committing a session it searches for families of iso_rr files which stem from the same disk file, have identical content filtering and have identical properties. The family members all get the same inode number. Whether these numbers are respected at mount time depends on the operating system.</p><p>Command -lsl displays hardlink counts if "lsl_count" is enabled. This can slow down the command substantially after changes to the ISO image have been made. Therefore the default is "no_lsl_count".</p><p>Commands -update and -update_r track splits and fusions of hard links in filesystems which have stable device and inode numbers. This can cause automatic last minute changes before the session gets written. Command -hardlinks "perform_update" may be used to do these changes earlier, e.g. if you need to apply filters to all updated files.</p><p>Mode "without_update" avoids hardlink processing during update commands. Use this if your filesystem situation does not allow -disk_dev_ino "on".</p><p><strong>xorriso</strong> commands which extract files from an ISO image try to hardlink files with identical inode number. The normal scope of this operation is from image load to image load. One may give up the accumulated hard link addresses by -hardlinks "discard_extract".</p><p>A large number of hardlink families may exhaust -temp_mem_limit if not -osirrox "sort_lba_on" and -hardlinks "cheap_sorted_extract" are both in effect. This restricts hard linking to other files restored by the same single extract command. -hardlinks "normal_extract" re-enables wide and expensive hardlink accumulation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-acl</strong> "on"|"off"</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable or disable processing of ACLs. If enabled, then <strong>xorriso</strong> will obtain ACLs from disk file objects, store ACLs in the ISO image using the libisofs specific AAIP format, load AAIP data from ISO images, test ACL during file comparison, and restore ACLs to disk files when extracting them from ISO images. See also commands -getfacl, -setfacl.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-xattr</strong> "on"|"off"</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable or disable processing of xattr attributes in user namespace. If enabled, then <strong>xorriso</strong> will handle xattr similar to ACL. See also commands -getfattr, -setfattr and above paragraph about xattr.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-md5</strong> "on"|"all"|"off"|"load_check_off"</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable or disable processing of MD5 checksums for the overall session and for each single data file. If enabled then images with checksum tags get loaded only if the tags of superblock and directory tree match properly. The MD5 checksums of data files and whole session get loaded from the image if there are any.</p><p>With commands -compare and -update the recorded MD5 of a file will be used to avoid content reading from the image. Only the disk file content will be read and compared with that MD5. This can save much time if -disk_dev_ino "on" is not suitable.</p><p>At image generation time they are computed for each file which gets its data written into the new session. The checksums of files which have their data in older sessions get copied into the new session. Superblock, tree and whole session get a checksum tag each.</p><p>Mode "all" will additionally check during image generation whether the checksum of a data file changed between the time when its reading began and the time when it ended. This implies reading every file twice.</p><p>Mode "load_check_off" together with "on" or "all" will load recorded MD5 sums but not test the recorded checksum tags of superblock and directory tree. This is necessary if growisofs was used as burn program, because it does not overwrite the superblock checksum tag of the first session. Therefore load_check_off is in effect when <strong>xorriso</strong> -as mkisofs option -M is performed.</p><p>The test can be re-enabled by mode "load_check_on".</p><p>Checksums can be exploited via commands -check_md5, -check_md5_r, via find actions get_md5, check_md5, and via -check_media.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>-for_backup</strong></p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>-disk_dev_ino</strong> "on"|"ino_only"|"off"</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enable or disable processing of recorded file identification numbers (dev_t and ino_t). If enabled they are stored as xattr and allow to substantially accelerate file comparison. The root node gets a global start timestamp. If during comparison a file with younger timestamps is found in the ISO image, then it is suspected to have inconsistent content.</p><p>If device numbers and inode numbers of the disk filesystems are persistent and if no irregular alterations of timestamps or system clock happen, then potential content changes can be detected without reading that content. File content change is assumed if any of mtime, ctime, device number or inode number have changed.</p><p>Mode "ino_only" replaces the precondition that device numbers are stable by the precondition that mount points in the compared tree always lead to the same filesystems. Use this if mode "on" always sees all files changed.</p><p>The speed advantage appears only if the loaded session was produced with -disk_dev_ino "on" too.</p><p>Note that -disk_dev_ino "off" is totally in effect only if -hardlinks is "off", too.</p>

    <p><strong>-rom_toc_scan</strong> "on"|"force"|"off"[:"emul_off"][:"emul_wide"]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Read-only drives do not tell the actual media type but show any media as ROM (e.g. as DVD-ROM). The session history of MMC multi-session media might be truncated to first and last session or even be completely false. (The emulated history of overwriteable media is not affected by this.)</p><p>To have in case of failure a chance of getting the session history and especially the address of the last session, there is a scan for ISO 9660 filesystem headers which might help but also might yield worse results than the drive's table of content. At its end it can cause read attempts to invalid addresses and thus ugly drive behavior. Setting "on" enables that scan for alleged read-only media.</p><p>Some operating systems are not able to mount the most recent session of multi-session DVD or BD. If on such a system <strong>xorriso</strong> has no own MMC capabilities then it may still find that session from a scanned table of content. Setting "force" handles any media like a ROM medium with setting "on".</p><p>On the other hand the emulation of session history on overwriteable media can hamper reading of partly damaged media. Setting "off:emul_off" disables the elsewise trustworthy table-of-content scan for those media.</p><p>The table-of-content scan on overwriteable media normally searches only up to the end of the session that is pointed to by the superblock at block 0. Setting "on:emul_wide" lets the scan continue up to the end of the medium. This may be useful after copying a medium with -check_media patch_lba0=on when not the last session was loaded.</p>

    <p>Reduce drive noise until it is actually used again. Some drives stay alert for substantial time after they have been used for reading. This reduces the startup time for the next drive operation but can be loud and waste energy if no i/o with the drive is expected to happen soon.</p><p>Modes "in", "out", "all" immediately calm down -indev, -outdev, resp. both.

This may lead to earlier detection of severe problems, and may avoid some less severe error events.</p><p>Mode "appendable_wo" is like "on" with the additional property that non-empty write-only files are regarded as appendable rather than blank.</p>

    <p>Set the size and granularity of the data cache which is used when ISO images are loaded and when file content is read from ISO images. The cache consists of several tiles, which each consists of several blocks. A larger cache reduces the need for tiles being read multiple times. Larger tiles might additionally improve the data throughput from the drive, but can be wasteful if the data are scattered over the medium.</p><p>Larger cache sizes help best with image loading from MMC drives. They are an inferior alternative to -osirrox option "sort_lba_on".</p><p>blocks_per_tile must be a power of 2. E.g. 16, 32, or 64. The overall cache size must not exceed 1 GiB. The default values can be restored by parameter "default" instead of one or both of the numbers. Currently the default is 32 tiles of 32 blocks = 2 MiB.</p>

</dl>
<p>The following commands expect file addresses of two kinds:</p><p><strong>disk_path</strong> is a path to an object in the local filesystem tree.</p><p><strong>iso_rr_path</strong> is the Rock Ridge name of a file object in the ISO image. If no Rock Ridge information is recorded in the loaded ISO image, then you will see ISO 9660 names which are of limited length and character set. If no Rock Ridge information shall be stored in an emerging ISO image, then their names will get mapped to such restricted ISO 9660 names.</p><p>Note that in the ISO image you are as powerful as the superuser. Access permissions of the existing files in the image do not apply to your write operations. They are intended to be in effect with the read-only mounted image.</p><p>If the iso_rr_path of a newly inserted file leads to an existing file object in the ISO image, then the following collision handling happens:</p><p>If both objects are directories then they get merged by recursively inserting the subobjects from filesystem into ISO image. If other file types collide then the setting of command <strong>-overwrite</strong> decides.</p><p>Renaming of files has similar collision handling, but directories can only be replaced, not merged. Note that if the target directory exists, then -mv inserts the source objects into this directory rather than attempting to replace it. Command -move, on the other hand, would attempt to replace it.</p><p>The commands in this section alter the ISO image and not the local filesystem.</p>

Only the newest Linux kernels seem to read properly files &gt;= 4 GiB - 1.</p><p>A clumsy remedy for this limit is to backup file pieces and to concatenate them at restore time. A well tested chopping size is 2047m. It is permissible to request a higher byte_count than available. The resulting file will be truncated to the correct size of a final piece. To request a byte_offset higher than available yields no file in the ISO image but a SORRY event. E.g:</p><p> -cut_out /my/disk/file 0 2047m &#92;</p><p> /file/part_1_of_3_at_0_with_2047m_of_5753194821 &#92;</p><p> -cut_out /my/disk/file 2047m 2047m &#92;</p><p> /file/part_2_of_3_at_2047m_with_2047m_of_5753194821 &#92;</p><p> -cut_out /my/disk/file 4094m 2047m &#92;</p><p> /file/part_3_of_3_at_4094m_with_2047m_of_5753194821</p><p>While command -split_size is set larger than 0, and if all pieces of a file reside in the same ISO directory with no other files, and if the names look like above, then their ISO directory will be recognized and handled like a regular file. This affects commands -compare*, -update*, and overwrite situations. See command -split_size for details.</p>

This applies to actions -add, -du*x, -ls*x, -findx, and to -disk_pattern expansion.</p><p>There are two kinds of follow decisison to be made:</p><p>"link" is the hop from a symbolic link to its target file object.

If enabled then mountpoint directories are handled as any other directory, else mountpoints are handled as empty directories if they are encountered in directory tree traversals.</p><p>Less general than above occasions:</p><p>"pattern" is mount and link hopping, but only during -disk_pattern expansion.</p><p>"param" is link hopping for parameter words (after eventual pattern expansion). If enabled then -ls*x will show the link targets rather than the links themselves. -du*x, -findx, and -add will process the link targets but not follow links in an eventual directory tree below the targets (unless "link" is enabled).</p><p>Occasions can be combined in a colon separated list. All occasions mentioned in the list will then lead to a positive follow decision.</p><p>"off" prevents any positive follow decision.

A link hop consists of a sequence of symbolic links and a final target of different type. Nevertheless those hops can loop. Example:</p>
<pre>
  $ ln -s .. uploop
</pre>
<p>Link hopping has a built-in loop detection which stops hopping at the first repetition of a link target. Then the repeated link is handled as itself and not as its target. Regrettably one can construct link networks which cause exponential workload before their loops get detected. The number given with "limit=" can curb this workload at the risk of truncating an intentional sequence of link hops.</p>

Character '/' is not special but can be matched by wildcards.</p><p><strong>-disk_name</strong> pattern : Like -name but testing the leaf name of the file source on disk. Can match only data files which do not stem from the loaded image, or for directories above such data files. With directories the result can change between -find runs if their content stems from multiple sources.</p><p><strong>-disk_path</strong> disk_path : Matches if the given disk_path is equal to the path of the file source on disk. The same restrictions apply as with -disk_name.</p><p><strong>-type</strong> type_letter : Matches files of the given type: "block", "char", "dir", "pipe", "file", "link", "socket", "eltorito", and "Xotic" which matches what is not matched by the other types.</p><p>Only the first letter is interpreted.  E.g.: -find / -type d</p><p><strong>-damaged</strong> : Matches files which use data blocks marked as damaged by a previous run of -check_media. The damage info vanishes when a new ISO image gets loaded.</p><p>Note that a MD5 session mismatch marks all files of the session as damaged. If finer distinction is desired, perform -md5 off before -check_media.</p><p><strong>-pending_data</strong> : Matches files which get their content from outside the loaded ISO image.</p><p><strong>-lba_range</strong> start_lba block_count : Matches files which use data blocks within the range of start_lba and start_lba+block_count-1.</p><p><strong>-has_acl</strong> : Matches files which have a non-trivial ACL.</p><p><strong>-has_xattr</strong> : Matches files which have xattr name-value pairs from user namespace.</p><p><strong>-has_aaip</strong> : Matches files which have ACL or any xattr.</p><p><strong>-has_any_xattr</strong> : Matches files which have any xattr other than ACL.</p><p><strong>-has_md5</strong> : Matches data files which have MD5 checksums.</p><p><strong>-has_hfs_crtp</strong> creator type : Matches files which have the given HFS+ creator and type attached. These are codes of 4 characters which get stored if -hfsplus is enabled. Use a single dash '-' as wildcard that matches any such code. E.g:.</p><p> -has_hfs_crtp YYDN TEXT</p><p> -has_hfs_crtp - -</p><p><strong>-has_hfs_bless</strong> blessing : Matches files which bear the given HFS+ blessing. It may be one of : "ppc_bootdir", "intel_bootfile", "show_folder", "os9_folder", "osx_folder", "any". See also action set_hfs_bless.</p><p><strong>-has_filter</strong> : Matches files which are filtered by -set_filter.</p><p><strong>-hidden</strong> hide_state : Matches files which are hidden in "iso_rr" tree, in "joliet" tree, in "hfsplus" tree, in all trees ("on"), or not hidden in any tree ("off").</p><p>Those which are hidden in some tree match -not -hidden "off".</p><p><strong>-prune</strong> : If this test is reached and the tested file is a directory then -find will not dive into that directory. This test itself does always match.</p><p><strong>-decision</strong> "yes"|"no" : If this test is reached then the evaluation ends immediately and action is performed if the decision is "yes" or "true". See operator -if.</p><p><strong>-true</strong> and <strong>-false</strong> : Always match resp. match not. Evaluation goes on.</p><p><strong>-sort_lba</strong> : Always match. This causes -find to perform its action in a sequence sorted by the ISO image block addresses of the files. It may improve throughput with actions which read data from optical drives. Action will always get the absolute path as parameter.</p><p>Available operators are:</p><p><strong>-not</strong> : Matches if the next test or sub expression does not match. Several tests do this specifically:</p><p>-undamaged, -lba_range with negative start_lba, -has_no_acl, -has_no_xattr, -has_no_aaip, -has_no_filter .</p><p><strong>-and</strong> : Matches if both neighboring tests or expressions match.</p><p><strong>-or</strong> : Matches if at least one of both neighboring tests or expressions matches.</p><p><strong>-sub</strong> ... <strong>-subend</strong> or <strong>(</strong> ... <strong>)</strong> : Enclose a sub expression which gets evaluated first before it is processed by neighboring operators. Normal precedence is: -not, -or , -and.</p><p><strong>-if</strong> ... <strong>-then</strong>&nbsp;... <strong>-elseif</strong> ... <strong>-then</strong> ... <strong>-else</strong> ... <strong>-endif</strong> : Enclose one or more sub expressions. If the -if expression matches, then the -then expression is evaluated as the result of the whole expression up to -endif. Else the next -elseif expression is evaluated and if it matches, its -then expression. Finally in case of no match, the -else expression is evaluated. There may be more than one -elseif. Neither -else nor -elseif are mandatory. If -else is missing and would be hit, then the result is a non-match.</p><p>-if-expressions are the main use case for above test -decision.</p><p>Default action is <strong>echo</strong>, i.e. to print the address of the found file. Other actions are certain <strong>xorriso</strong> commands which get performed on the found files. These commands may have specific parameters. See also their particular descriptions.</p><p><strong>chown</strong> and <strong>chown_r</strong> change the ownership and get the user id as parameter. E.g.: -exec chown thomas --</p><p><strong>chgrp</strong> and <strong>chgrp_r</strong> change the group attribute and get the group id as parameter. E.g.: -exec chgrp_r staff --</p><p><strong>chmod</strong> and <strong>chmod_r</strong> change access permissions and get a mode string as parameter.  E.g.: -exec chmod a-w,a+r --</p><p><strong>alter_date</strong> and <strong>alter_date_r</strong> change the timestamps. They get a type character and a timestring as parameters.</p><p>E.g.: -exec alter_date "m" "Dec 30 19:34:12 2007" --</p><p><strong>lsdl</strong> prints file information like shell command ls -dl.</p><p><strong>compare</strong> performs command -compare with the found file address as iso_rr_path and the corresponding file address below its parameter disk_path_start. For this the iso_rr_path of the -find command gets replaced by the disk_path_start.</p><p>E.g.: -find /thomas -exec compare /home/thomas --</p><p><strong>update</strong> performs command -update with the found file address as iso_rr_path. The corresponding file address is determined like with above action "compare".</p><p><strong>update_merge</strong> is like update but does not delete the found file if it is missing on disk. It may be run several times and records with all visited files whether their counterpart on disk has already been seen by one of the update_merge runs. Finally, a -find run with action "rm_merge" may remove all files that saw no counterpart on disk.</p><p>Up to the next "rm_merge" or "clear_merge" all newly inserted files will get marked as having a disk counterpart.</p><p><strong>rm</strong> removes the found iso_rr_path from the image if it is not a directory with files in it. I.e. this "rm" includes "rmdir".</p><p><strong>rm_r</strong> removes the found iso_rr_path from the image, including whole directory trees.</p><p><strong>rm_merge</strong> removes the found iso_rr_path if it was visited by one or more previous actions "update_merge" and saw no counterpart on disk in any of them. The marking from the update actions is removed in any case.</p><p><strong>clear_merge</strong> removes an eventual marking from action "update_merge".</p><p><strong>report_damage</strong> classifies files whether they hit a data block that is marked as damaged. The result is printed together with the address of the first damaged byte, the maximum span of damages, file size, and the path of the file.</p><p><strong>report_lba</strong> prints files which are associated to image data blocks. It tells the logical block address, the block number, the byte size, and the path of each file. There may be reported more than one line per file if the file is very large. In this case each line has a different extent number in column "xt".</p><p><strong>getfacl</strong> prints access permissions in ACL text form to the result channel.</p><p><strong>setfacl</strong> attaches ACLs after removing existing ones. The new ACL is given in text form as defined with command -setfacl.</p><p>E.g.: -exec setfacl u:lisa:rw,u::rw,g::r,o::-,m::rw --</p><p><strong>getfattr</strong> prints xattr name-value pairs from user namespace to the result channel.</p><p><strong>get_any_xattr</strong> prints xattr name-value pairs from any namespace except ACL to the result channel. This is mostly for debugging of namespace "isofs".</p><p><strong>list_extattr</strong> mode prints a script to the result channel, which would use FreeBSD command setextattr to set the file's xattr name-value pairs of user namespace. Parameter mode controls the form of the output of names and values. Default mode "e" prints harmless characters in shell quotation marks, but represents texts with octal 001 to 037 and 0177 to 0377 by an embedded echo -e command. Mode "q" prints any characters in shell quotation marks. This might not be terminal-safe but should work in script files. Mode "r" uses no quotation marks. Not safe. Mode "b" prints backslash encoding. Not suitable for shell parsing.</p><p>E.g. -exec list_extattr e --</p><p>Command -backslash_codes does not affect the output.</p><p><strong>get_md5</strong> prints the MD5 sum, if recorded, together with file path.</p><p><strong>check_md5</strong> compares the MD5 sum, if recorded, with the file content and reports if mismatch.</p><p>E.g.: -find / -not -pending_data -exec check_md5 FAILURE --</p><p><strong>make_md5</strong> equips a data file with an MD5 sum of its content. Useful to upgrade the files in the loaded image to full MD5 coverage by the next commit with -md5 "on".</p><p>E.g.: -find / -type f -not -has_md5 -exec make_md5 --</p><p><strong>setfattr</strong> sets or deletes xattr name value pairs.</p><p>E.g.: -find / -has_xattr -exec setfattr --remove-all '' --</p><p><strong>set_hfs_crtp</strong> adds, changes, or removes HFS+ creator and type attributes.</p><p>E.g.: -exec set_hfs_crtp YYDN TEXT</p><p>E.g.: -find /my/dir -prune -exec set_hfs_crtp --delete -</p><p><strong>get_hfs_crtp</strong> prints the HFS+ creator and type attributes together with the iso_rr_path, if the file has such attributes at all.</p><p>E.g.: -exec get_hfs_crtp</p><p><strong>set_hfs_bless</strong> applies or removes HFS+ blessings. They are roles which can be attributed to up to four directories and a data file:</p><p>"ppc_bootdir", "intel_bootfile", "show_folder", "os9_folder", "osx_folder".</p><p>They may be abbreviated as "p", "i", "s", "9", and "x".</p><p>Each such role can be attributed to at most one file object. "intel_bootfile" is the one that would apply to a data file. All others apply to directories. The -find run will end as soon as the first blessing is issued. The previous bearer of the blessing will lose it then. No file object can bear more than one blessing.</p><p>E.g.: -find /my/blessed/directory -exec set_hfs_bless p</p><p>Further there is blessing "none" or "n" which revokes any blessing from the found files. This -find run will not stop when the first match is reached.</p><p>E.g.: -find / -has_hfs_bless any -exec set_hfs_bless none</p><p><strong>get_hfs_bless</strong> prints the HFS+ blessing role and the iso_rr_path, if the file is blessed at all.</p><p>E.g.: -exec get_hfs_bless</p><p><strong>set_filter</strong> applies or removes filters.</p><p>E.g.: -exec set_filter --zisofs --</p><p><strong>mkisofs_r</strong> applies the rules of mkisofs -r to the file object:</p><p>user id and group id become 0, all r-permissions get granted, all w denied. If there is any x-permission, then all three x get granted. s- and t-bits get removed.</p><p><strong>sort_weight</strong> attributes a LBA weight number to regular files.</p><p>The number may range from -2147483648 to 2147483647. The higher it is, the lower will be the block address of the file data in the emerging ISO image. Currently the boot catalog has a hardcoded weight of 1 billion. Normally it should occupy the block with the lowest possible address.</p><p>Data files which are loaded by -indev or -dev get a weight between 1 and 2 exp 28 = 268,435,456, depending on their block address. This shall keep them roughly in the same order if the write method of modifying is applied.</p><p>Data files which are added by other commands get an initial weight of 0.</p><p>E.g.: -exec sort_weight 3 --</p><p><strong>show_stream</strong> shows the content stream chain of a data file.</p><p><strong>hide</strong> brings the file into one of the hide states "on", "iso_rr", "joliet", "hfsplus", "off". They may be combined. E.g.: joliet:hfsplus</p><p>E.g.:</p>
<pre>
  -find / -disk_name *_secret -exec hide on
</pre>
<p><strong>estimate_size</strong> prints a lower and an upper estimation of the number of blocks which the found files together will occupy in the emerging ISO image. This does not account for the superblock, for the directories in the -find path, or for image padding.</p><p><strong>find</strong> performs another run of -find on the matching file address. It accepts the same params as -find, except iso_rr_path.</p><p>E.g.:</p>
<pre>
  -find / -name '???' -type d -exec find -name '[abc]*' -exec chmod a-w,a+r --

</dl>
<p><strong>Filters</strong> may be installed between data files in the ISO image and their content source outside the image. They may also be used vice versa between data content in the image and target files on disk.</p><p>Built-in filters are "--zisofs" and "--zisofs-decode". The former is to be applied via -set_filter, the latter is automatically applied if zisofs compressed content is detected with a file when loading the ISO image.</p><p>Another built-in filter pair is "--gzip" and "--gunzip" with suffix ".gz". They behave about like external gzip and gunzip but avoid forking a process for each single file. So they are much faster if there are many small files.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-external_filter</strong> name option[:option] program_path [arguments] --</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Register a content filter by associating a name with a program path, program arguments, and some behavioral options. Once registered it can be applied to multiple data files in the ISO image, regardless whether their content resides in the loaded ISO image or in the local filesystem. External filter processes may produce synthetic file content by reading the original content from stdin and writing to stdout whatever they want. They must deliver the same output on the same input in repeated runs.</p><p>Options are:</p><p> "default" means that no other option is intended.</p><p> "suffix=..." sets a file name suffix. If it is not empty then it will be appended to the file name or removed from it.</p><p> "remove_suffix" will remove a file name suffix rather than appending it.</p><p> "if_nonempty" will leave 0-sized files unfiltered.</p><p> "if_reduction" will try filtering and revoke it if the content size does not shrink.</p><p> "if_block_reduction" will revoke if the number of 2 kB blocks does not shrink.</p><p> "used=..." is ignored. Command -status shows it with the number of files which currently have the filter applied.</p><p>Examples:</p><p> -external_filter bzip2 suffix=.bz2:if_block_reduction &#92;</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Apply an -external_filter or a built-in filter to the given data files in the ISO image. If the filter suffix is not empty , then it will be applied to the file name. Renaming only happens if the filter really gets attached and is not revoked by its options. By default files which already bear the suffix will not get filtered. The others will get the suffix appended to their names. If the filter has option "remove_suffix", then the filter will only be applied if the suffix is present and can be removed. Name oversize or collision caused by suffix change will prevent filtering.</p><p>With most filter types this command will immediately run the filter once for each file in order to determine the output size. Content reading operations like -extract , -compare and image generation will perform further filter runs and deliver filtered content.</p><p>At image generation time the filter output must still be the same as the output from the first run. Filtering for image generation does not happen with files from the loaded ISO image if the write method of growing is in effect (i.e -indev and -outdev are identical).</p><p>The reserved filter name "--remove-all-filters" revokes filtering. This will revoke suffix renamings as well. Use "--remove-all-filters+" to prevent any suffix renaming.</p><p>Attaching or detaching filters will not alter the state of -changes_pending. If the filter manipulations shall be the only changes in a write run, then explicitely execute -changes_pending "yes".</p>

This is mainly useful for setting state "yes" despite no real changes were made. The sequence -changes_pending "no" -end is equivalent to the command -rollback_end.

It is not unnormal with several types of media that there is no progress visible for the first few minutes or that the drive gnaws on the medium for a few minutes after all data have been transmitted. <strong>xorriso</strong> and the drives are in a client-server relationship.

The first 8 bytes of the System Area get overwritten by { 0x45, 0x52, 0x08 0x00, 0xeb, 0x02, 0xff, 0xff } which can be executed as x86 machine code without negative effects. So if an MBR gets combined with this feature, then its first 8 bytes should contain no essential commands.</p><p>The next blocks of 2 KiB in the System Area will be occupied by APM entries. The first one covers the part of the ISO image before the HFS+ filesystem metadata. The second one marks the range from HFS+ metadata to the end of file content data. If more ISO image data follow, then a third partition entry gets produced. Other features of xorriso might cause the need for more APM entries.</p><p>The HFS+ filesystem is not suitable for add-on sessions produced by the multi-session method of growing. An existing ISO image may nevertheless be the base for a new image produced by the method of modifying. If -hfsplus is enabled when -indev or -dev gets executed, then AAIP attributes get loaded from the input image and checked for information about HFS creator, filetype, or blessing. If found, then they get enabled as settings for the next image production. Therefore it is advisable to perform -hfsplus "on" before -indev or -dev.</p><p>Information about HFS creator, type, and blessings gets stored by xorriso if -hfsplus is enabled at -commit time. It is stored as copy outside the HFS+ partition, but rather along with the Rock Ridge information. xorriso does not read any information from the HFS+ meta data.</p><p>Be aware that HFS+ is case-insensitive although it can record file names with upper-case and lower-case letters. Therefore, file names from the iso_rr name tree may collide in the HFS+ name tree. In this case they get changed by adding underscore characters and counting numbers. In case of very long names, it might be necessary to map them to "MANGLED_...".</p>

    <p>Adjust the compliance to specifications of ISO 9660/ECMA-119 and its contemporary extensions. In some cases it is worth to deviate a bit in order to circumvent bugs of the intended reader system or to get unofficial extra features.</p><p>There are several adjustable rules which have a keyword each. If they are mentioned with this command then their rule gets added to the relaxation list. This list can be erased by rules "strict" or "clear". It can be reset to its start setting by "default". All of the following relaxation rules can be revoked individually by appending "_off". Like "deep_paths_off".</p><p>Rule keywords are:</p><p>"iso_9660_level="number chooses level 1 with ECMA-119 names of the form 8.3 and -file_size_limit &lt;= 4g - 1, or level 2 with ECMA-119 names up to length 32 and the same -file_size_limit, or level 3 with ECMA-119 names up to length 32 and -file_size_limit &gt;= 400g -200k. If necessary -file_size_limit gets adjusted.</p><p>"allow_dir_id_ext" allows ECMA-119 names of directories to have a name extension as with other file types. It does not force dots and it omits the version number, though. This is a bad tradition of mkisofs which violates ECMA-119. Especially ISO level 1 only allows 8 characters in a directory name and not 8.3.</p><p>"omit_version" does not add versions (";1") to ECMA-119 and Joliet file names.</p><p>"only_iso_version" does not add versions (";1") to Joliet file names.</p><p>"deep_paths" allows ECMA-119 file paths deeper than 8 levels.</p><p>"long_paths" allows ECMA-119 file paths longer than 255 characters.</p><p>"long_names" allows up to 37 characters with ECMA-119 file names.</p><p>"no_force_dots" does not add a dot to ECMA-119 file names which have none.</p><p>"no_j_force_dots" does not add a dot to Joliet file names which have none.</p><p>"lowercase" allows lowercase characters in ECMA-119 file names.</p><p>"7bit_ascii" allows nearly all 7-bit characters in ECMA-119 file names. Not allowed are 0x0 and '/'. If not "lowercase" is enabled, then lowercase letters get converted to uppercase.</p><p>"full_ascii" allows all 8-bit characters except 0x0 and '/' in ECMA-119 file names.</p><p>"untranslated_names" might be dangerous for inadverted reader programs which rely on the restriction to at most 37 characters in ECMA-119 file names. This rule allows ECMA-119 file names up to 96 characters with no character conversion. If a file name has more characters, then image production will fail deliberately.</p><p>"untranslated_name_len="number enables untranslated_names with a smaller limit for the length of file names. 0 disables this feature, -1 chooses maximum length limit, numbers larger than 0 give the desired length limit.</p><p>"joliet_long_names" allows Joliet leaf names up to 103 characters rather than 64.</p><p>"joliet_long_paths" allows Joliet paths longer than 240 characters.</p><p>"always_gmt" stores timestamps in GMT representation with timezone 0.</p><p>"rec_mtime" records with non-RockRidge directory entries the disk file's mtime and not the creation time of the image. This applies to the ECMA-119 tree (plain ISO 9660), to Joliet, and to ISO 9660:1999. "rec_time" is default. If disabled, it gets automatically re-enabled by -as mkisofs emulation when a pathspec is encountered.</p><p>"new_rr" uses Rock Ridge version 1.12 (suitable for GNU/Linux but not for older FreeBSD or for Solaris). This implies "aaip_susp_1_10_off" which may be changed by subsequent "aaip_susp_1_10".</p><p>Default is "old_rr" which uses Rock Ridge version 1.10. This implies also "aaip_susp_1_10" which may be changed by subsequent "aaip_susp_1_10_off".</p><p>"aaip_susp_1_10" allows AAIP to be written as unofficial extension of RRIP rather than as official extension under SUSP-1.12.</p><p>"no_emul_toc" saves 64 kB with the first session on overwriteable media but makes the image incapable of displaying its session history.</p><p>"iso_9660_1999" causes the production of an additional directory tree compliant to ISO 9660:1999. It can record long filenames for readers which do not understand Rock Ridge.</p><p>"old_empty" uses the old way of of giving block addresses in the range of [0,31] to files with no own data content. The new way is to have a dedicated block to which all such files will point.</p><p>Default setting is</p><p> "clear:only_iso_version:deep_paths:long_paths:no_j_force_dots:</p><p> always_gmt:old_rr".</p><p>Note: The term "ECMA-119 name" means the plain ISO 9660 names and attributes which get visible if the reader ignores Rock Ridge.</p>

<p>Contrary to published specifications many BIOSes will load an El Torito record from the first session on media and not from the last one, which gets mounted by default. This makes no problems with overwriteable media, because they appear to inadverted readers as one single session.</p><p>But with multi-session media CD-R[W], DVD-R[W], DVD+R, it implies that the whole bootable system has to reside already in the first session and that the last session still has to bear all files which the booted system expects after mounting the ISO image.</p><p>If a boot image from ISOLINUX or GRUB is known to be present on media then it is advised to patch it when a follow-up session gets written. But one should not rely on the capability to influence the bootability of the existing sessions, unless one can assume overwriteable media.</p><p>There are booting mechanisms which do not use an El Torito record but rather start at the first bytes of the image: PC-BIOS MBR for hard-disk-like devices, MIPS Volume Header for old SGI computers, DEC Boot Block for old DECstation, SUN Disk Label for SPARC machines.</p><p>The boot firmware EFI may use programs which are located in a FAT filesystem and announced by an MBR partition table entry.</p>

<p>Define the handling of a set of El Torito boot images which has been read from an existing ISO image or define how to make a prepared boot image file set bootable. Such file sets get produced by ISOLINUX or GRUB.</p><p>Each -boot_image command has two parameters: type and setting. More than one -boot_image command may be used to define the handling of one or more boot images.

Type <strong>any</strong> makes no assumptions about the origin of the boot images.</p><p>El Torito boot images of any type can be newly inserted, or discarded, or patched, or kept unaltered. Whether to patch or to keep depends on whether the boot images contain boot info tables.</p><p>A boot info table needs to be patched when the boot image gets newly introduced into the ISO image or if an existing image gets relocated. This is automatically done if type "isolinux" or "grub" is given, but not with "any".</p><p>If patching is enabled, then boot images from previous sessions will be checked whether they seem to bear a boot info table. If not, then they stay unpatched. This check is not infallible. So if you do know that the images need no patching, use "any" "keep".

It is used to describe the parameters of a boot image by an El Torito record or a MBR. The names "dir", "bin_path", "efi_path" lead to El Torito bootable images.

In further sessions an existing boot image can get replaced by a new one, but depending on the media type this may have few effect at boot time. See above.</p><p>The boot image and its supporting files have to be added to the ISO image by normal means (image loading, -map, -add, ...). In case of ISOLINUX the files should reside either in ISO image directory /isolinux or in /boot/isolinux . In that case it suffices to use as bootspec the text "dir=/isolinux" or "dir=/boot/isolinux".

It is subject to normal -overwrite and -reassure processing if there is already a file with the same name. The catalog lists the boot images and is read by the boot facility to choose one of the boot images. But it is not necessary that it appears in the directory tree at all. One may hide it in all trees by <strong>cat_hidden=on</strong>. Other possible values are "iso_rr", "joliet", "hfsplus", and the default "off".</p><p><strong>bin_path=</strong> depicts a boot image file, a binary program which is to be started by the hardware boot facility (e.g. the BIOS) at boot time.</p><p><strong>efi_path=</strong> depicts a boot image file that is ready for EFI booting. Its load_size is determined automatically, no boot info table gets written, no boot medium gets emulated, platform_id is 0xef.</p><p><strong>emul_type=</strong> can be one of "no_emulation", "hard_disk", "diskette".

The address is written as 64 bit little-endian number. It is the 2KB block address of the boot image content, multiplied by 4, and then incremented by 5. "grub2_boot_info=off" disables this patching.</p><p><strong>platform_id=</strong> defines by two hex digits the Platform ID of the boot image. "00" is 80x86 PC-BIOS, "01" is PowerPC, "02" is Mac, "ef" is EFI.</p><p><strong>id_string=</strong>text|56_hexdigits defines the ID string of the boot catalog section where the boot image will be listed. If the value consists of 56 characters [0-9A-Fa-f] then it is converted into 28 bytes, else the first 28 characters become the ID string. The ID string of the first boot image becomes the overall catalog ID. It is limited to 24 characters. Other id_strings become section IDs.</p><p><strong>sel_crit=</strong>hexdigits defines the Selection Criteria of the boot image. Up to 20 bytes get read from the given characters [0-9A-Fa-f]. They get attributed to the boot image entry in the catalog.</p><p><strong>next</strong> ends the definition of a boot image and starts a new one. Any following -bootimage bootspecs will affect the new image. The first "next" discards loaded boot images and their catalog.</p><p><strong>discard</strong> gives up an existing boot catalog and its boot images.</p><p><strong>keep</strong> keeps or copies boot images unaltered and writes a new catalog.</p><p><strong>patch</strong> applies patching to existing boot images if they seem to bear a boot info table.</p><p><strong>system_area=</strong>disk_path copies at most 32768 bytes from the given disk file to the very start of the ISO image. This System Area is reserved for system dependent boot software, e.g. an MBR which can be used to boot from USB stick or hard disk.</p><p>Other than a El Torito boot image, the file disk_path needs not to be added to the ISO image.</p><p>-boot_image isolinux system_area= implies "partition_table=on".</p><p><strong>grub2_mbr=</strong>disk_path works like "any" system_area= with additional patching for modern GRUB MBRs. The content start address of the first boot image is converted to a count of 512 byte blocks, and an offset of 4 is added. The result is written as 64 bit little-endian number to byte address 0x1b0.</p><p><strong>partition_table=on</strong> causes a simple partition table to be written into bytes 446 to 511 of the System Area.</p><p>With type "isolinux" it shows a partition that begins at byte 0 and it causes the LBA of the first boot image to be written into the MBR. For the first session this works only if also "system_area=" and "bin_path=" or "dir=" is given.</p><p>With types "any" and "grub" it shows a single partition which starts at byte 512 and ends where the ISO image ends. This works with or without system_area= or boot image.</p><p>Bootspecs chrp_boot_part=, prep_boot_part=, and efi_boot_part= overwrite this entry in the MBR partition table.</p><p>In follow-up sessions the existing System Area is preserved by default. If types "isolinux" or "grub" are set to "patch", then "partition_table=on" is activated without new boot image. In this case the existing System Area gets checked whether it bears addresses and sizes as if it had been processed by "partition_table=on". If so, then those parameters get updated when the new System Area is written.</p><p>Special "system_area=/dev/zero" causes 32k of NUL-bytes. Use this to discard an MBR which was loaded with the ISO image.</p><p><strong>chrp_boot_part=on</strong> causes a single partition in MBR which covers the whole ISO image and has type 0x41. This is not compatible with any other feature that produces MBR partition entries. It makes GPT unrecognizable.</p><p><strong>prep_boot_part=</strong> inserts the content of a data file into the image and marks it by an MBR partition of type 0x96. The parts of the ISO image before and after this partition will be covered by further MBR partitions. The data file is supposed to contain ELF executable code.</p><p><strong>efi_boot_part=</strong> inserts the content of a data file into the image and marks it by a GPT partition. If not chrp_boot_part=on, then the first partition in MBR will have type 0xee to announce the presence of GPT. The data file is supposed to contain a FAT filesystem.</p><p>Instead of a disk_path, the word --efi-boot-image may be given. It exposes in GPT the content of the first El Torito EFI boot image as EFI system partition. EFI boot images are introduced by bootspec efi_path=. The affected EFI boot image cannot show up in HFS+ because it is stored outside the HFS+ partition.</p><p><strong>partition_offset=</strong>2kb_block_adr causes a partition table with a single partition that begins at the given block address. This is counted in 2048 byte blocks, not in 512 byte blocks. If the block address is non-zero then it must be at least 16. A non-zero partition offset causes two superblocks to be generated and two sets of directory trees. The image is then mountable from its absolute start as well as from the partition start.</p><p>The offset value of an ISO image gets preserved when a new session is added. So the value defined here is only in effect if a new ISO image gets written.</p><p><strong>partition_hd_cyl=</strong>number gives the number of heads per cylinder for the partition table. 0 chooses a default value. Maximum is 255.</p><p><strong>partition_sec_hd=</strong>number gives the number of sectors per head for the partition table. 0 chooses a default value. Maximum is 63.</p><p>The product partition_sec_hd * partition_hd_cyl * 512 is the cylinder size. It should be divisible by 2048 in order to allow exact alignment. If it is too small to describe the image size by at most 1024 cylinders, then appropriate values of partition_hd_cyl are chosen with partition_sec_hd 32 or 63. If the image is larger than 8,422,686,720 bytes, then the cylinder size constraints cannot be fulfilled.</p><p><strong>partition_cyl_align=</strong>mode controls image size alignment to an integer number of cylinders. It is prescribed by isohybrid specs and it seems to please program fdisk. Cylinder size must be divisible by 2048. Images larger than 8,323,596,288 bytes cannot be aligned.</p><p>Mode "auto" is default. Alignment by padding happens only with "isolinux" "partition_table=on".</p><p>Mode "on" causes alignment by padding with "partition_table=on" for any type. Mode "all" is like "on" but also pads up partitions from -append_partition to an aligned size.</p><p>Mode "off" disables alignment for any type.</p><p><strong>mips_path=</strong>iso_rr_path declares a data file in the image to be a MIPS Big Endian boot file and causes production of a MIPS Big Endian Volume Header. This is mutually exclusive with production of other boot blocks like MBR. It will overwrite the first 512 bytes of any data provided by system_area=. Up to 15 boot files can be declared by mips_path=.</p><p><strong>mipsel_path=</strong>iso_rr_path declares a data file in the image to be the MIPS Little Endian boot file. This is mutually exclusive with other boot blocks. It will overwrite the first 512 bytes of any data provided by system_area=. Only a single boot file can be declared by mipsel_path=.</p><p><strong>sparc_label=</strong>text causes the production of a SUN Disk Label with the given text as ASCII label. This boot block format allows to append images for partitions 2 to 8. Partition 1 will always be the ISO image. See command -append_partition. The first 512 bytes of any data provided by system_area= will be overwritten.</p><p><strong>grub2_sparc_core=</strong>iso_rr_path causes the content address and size of the given file to be written after the SUN Disk Label. Both numbers are counted in bytes. The address is written as 64 bit big-endian number to byte 0x228. The size is written as 32 bit big-endian number to byte 0x230.</p><p><strong>mips_discard</strong> and <strong>sparc_discard</strong> revoke any boot file declarations made by mips_path= or mipsel_path=. They also disable production of SUN Disk Label. This removes the ban on production of other boot blocks.</p><p><strong>hfsplus_serial=</strong>hexstring sets a string of 16 digits "0" to "9" and letters "a" to "f", which will be used as unique serial number of an emerging HFS+ filesystem.</p><p><strong>hfsplus_block_size=</strong>number sets the allocation block size to be used when producing HFS+ filesystems. Permissible are 512, 2048, or 0. The latter lets the program decide.</p><p><strong>apm_block_size=</strong>number sets the block size to be used when describing partitions by an Apple Partition Map. Permissible are 512, 2048, or 0. The latter lets the program decide.</p><p>Note that size 512 is not compatible with production of GPT, and that size 2048 will not be mountable -t hfsplus at least by older Linux kernels.</p>

Debian CDs and DVD ISO images are published on the web in jigdo format to allow end users to download them more efficiently."</p><p><strong>xorriso</strong> can produce a .jigdo and a .template file together with a single-session ISO image. The .jigdo file contains checksums and symbolic file addresses. The .template file contains the compressed ISO image with reference tags instead of the content bytes of the listed files.</p><p>Input for this process are the normal arguments for a <strong>xorriso</strong> session on a blank -outdev, and a .md5 file which lists those data files which may be listed in the .jigdo file and externally referenced in the .template file. Each designated file is represented in the .md5 file by a single text line:</p><p>MD5 as 32 hex digits, 2 blanks, size as 12 decimal digits or blanks, 2 blanks, symbolic file address</p><p>The file address in an .md5 line has to bear the same basename as the disk_path of the file which it shall match. The directory path of the file address is decisive for To=From mapping, not for file recognition. After To=From mapping, the file address gets written into the .jigdo file. Jigdo restore tools will convert these addresses into really reachable data source addresses from which they can read.</p><p>If the list of jigdo parameters is not empty, then <strong>xorriso</strong> will refuse to write to non-blank targets, it will disable multi-session emulation, and padding will be counted as part of the ISO image.</p>

<p>File names are strings of non-zero bytes with 8 bit each. Unfortunately the same byte string may appear as different peculiar national characters on differently nationalized terminals. The meanings of byte codes are defined in <strong>character sets</strong> which have names. Shell command iconv -l lists them.</p><p>Character sets should not matter as long as only english alphanumeric characters are used for file names or as long as all writers and readers of the media use the same character set. Outside these constraints it may be necessary to let <strong>xorriso</strong> convert byte codes.</p><p>There is an input conversion from input character set to the local character set which applies when an ISO image gets loaded. A conversion from local character set to the output character set is performed when an image tree gets written. The sets can be defined independently by commands -in_charset and -out_charset. Normally one will have both identical, if ever.</p><p>If conversions are desired then <strong>xorriso</strong> needs to know the name of the local character set. <strong>xorriso</strong> can inquire the same info as shell command "locale" with argument "charmap". This may be influenced by environment variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG and should match the expectations of the terminal.</p><p>The default output charset is the local character set of the terminal where <strong>xorriso</strong> runs. So by default no conversion happens between local filesystem names and emerging names in the image. The situation stays ambigous and the reader has to riddle what character set was used.</p><p>By command -auto_charset it is possible to attribute the output charset name to the image. This makes the situation unambigous. But if your terminal character set does not match the character set of the local file names, then this attribute can become plainly wrong and cause problems at read time. To prevent this it is necessary to check whether the terminal properly displays all intended filenames. Check especially the exotic national characters.</p><p>To enforce recording of a particular character set name without any conversion at image generation time, set -charset and -local_charset to the desired name, and enable -backslash_codes to avoid evil character display on your terminal.</p>

<p>Since the tasks of <strong>xorriso</strong> are manifold and prone to external influence, there may arise the need for <strong>xorriso</strong> to report and handle problem events.</p><p>Those events get classified when they are detected by one of the software modules and forwarded to reporting and evaluation modules which decide about reactions. Event classes are sorted by severity:</p><p>"NEVER" The upper end of the severity spectrum.</p><p>"ABORT" The program is being aborted and on its way to end.</p><p>"FATAL" The main purpose of the run failed or an important resource failed unexpectedly.</p><p>"FAILURE" An important part of the job could not be performed.</p><p>"MISHAP" A FAILURE which can be tolerated during ISO image generation.</p><p>"SORRY" A less important part of the job could not be performed.</p><p>"WARNING" A situation is suspicious of being not intended by the user.</p><p>"HINT" A proposal to the user how to achieve better results.</p><p>"NOTE" A harmless information about noteworthy circumstances.</p><p>"UPDATE" A pacifier message during long running operations.</p><p>"DEBUG" A message which would only interest the program developers.</p><p>"ALL" The lower end of the severity spectrum.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon that optical media produce read errors. The reasons may be various and get obscured by error correction which is performed by the drives and based on extra data on the media. If a drive returns data then one can quite trust that they are valid. But at some degree of read problems the correction will fail and the drive is supposed to indicate error.</p><p><strong>xorriso</strong> can scan a medium for readable data blocks, classify them according to their read speed, save them to a file, and keep track of successfuly saved blocks for further tries on the same medium.</p><p>By command -md5 checksums may get recorded with data files and whole sessions. These checksums are reachable only via indev and a loaded image. They work independently of the media type and can detect transmission errors.</p>

The format is like with find -exec report_damage. Note that a MD5 session mismatch marks all files of the session as damaged. If finer distinction is desired, perform -md5 off before -check_media.</p><p><strong>report="blocks_files"</strong> first lists damaged blocks and then affected files.</p><p><strong>use="outdev"</strong> reads from the output drive instead of the input drive. This avoids loading the ISO image tree from media.</p><p><strong>use="sector_map"</strong> does not read any media but loads the file given by option sector_map= and processes this virtual outcome.</p><p><strong>what="disc"</strong> scans the payload range of a medium without respecting track gaps.</p><p><strong>what="image"</strong> similar to "disc", but restricts scanning to the range of the ISO 9660 image, if present.</p><p><strong>min_lba=limit</strong> omits all blocks with addresses lower than limit.</p><p><strong>max_lba=limit</strong> switches to what=disc and omits all blocks above limit.</p><p><strong>retry="on"</strong> forces read retries with single blocks when the normal read chunk produces a read error. By default, retries are only enabled with CD media. "retry=off" forbits retries for all media types.</p><p><strong>abort_file=disk_path</strong> gives the path of the file which may abort a scan run. Abort happens if the file exists and its mtime is not older than the start time of the run. Use shell command "touch" to trigger this. Other than an aborted program run, this will report the tested and untested blocks and go on with running <strong>xorriso</strong>.</p><p><strong>time_limit=seconds</strong> gives the number of seconds after which the scan shall be aborted. This is useful for unattended scanning of media which may else overwork the drive in its effort to squeeze out some readable blocks. Abort may be delayed by the drive gnawing on the last single read operation. Value -1 means unlimited time.</p><p><strong>item_limit=number</strong> gives the number of report list items after which to abort. Value -1 means unlimited item number.</p><p><strong>data_to=disk_path</strong> copies the valid blocks to the given file.</p><p><strong>event=severity</strong> sets the given severity for a problem event which shall be issued at the end of a check run if data blocks were unreadable or failed to match recorded MD5 checksums. Severity "ALL" disables this event.</p><p><strong>sector_map=disk_path</strong> tries to read the file given by disk_path as sector bitmap and to store such a map file after the scan run. The bitmap tells which blocks have been read successfully in previous runs. It allows to do several scans on the same medium, even with intermediate eject, in order to collect readable blocks whenever the drive is lucky enough to produce them. The stored file contains a human readable TOC of tracks and their start block addresses, followed by binary bitmap data.</p><p><strong>map_with_volid="on"</strong> examines tracks whether they are ISO images and prints their volume IDs into the human readable TOC of sector_map=.</p><p><strong>patch_lba0="on"</strong> transfers within the data_to= file a copy of the currently loaded session head to the start of that file and patches it to be valid at that position. This makes the loaded session the last valid session of the image file when it gets mounted or loaded as stdio: drive. New sessions will be appended after this last session and will overwrite any sessions which have followed it.</p><p><strong>patch_lba0="force"</strong> performs patch_lba0="on" even if <strong>xorriso</strong> believes that the copied data are not valid.</p><p>patch_lba0= may also bear a number. If it is 32 or higher it is taken as start address of the session to be copied. In this case it is not necessary to have an -indev and a loaded image. ":force" may be appended after the number.</p><p><strong>bad_limit=threshold</strong> sets the highest quality which shall be considered as damage. Choose one of "good", "md5_match", "slow", "partial", "valid", "untested", "invalid", "tao_end", "off_track", "md5_mismatch", "unreadable".</p><p><strong>slow_limit=threshold</strong> sets the time threshold for a single read chunk to be considered slow. This may be a fractional number like 0.1 or 1.5.</p><p><strong>chunk_size=size</strong> sets the number of bytes to be read in one read operation. This gets rounded down to full blocks of 2048 bytes. 0 means automatic size.</p><p><strong>async_chunks=number</strong> enables asynchronous MD5 processing if number is 2 or larger. In this case the given number of read chunks is allocated as fifo buffer. On very fast MMC drives try: chunk_size=64s async_chunks=16.</p>

<p>Normally <strong>xorriso</strong> only writes to disk files which were given as stdio: pseudo-drives or as log files. But its alter ego osirrox is able to extract file objects from ISO images and to create, overwrite, or delete file objects on disk.</p><p>Disk file exclusions by -not_mgt, -not_leaf, -not_paths apply. If disk file objects already exist then the settings of -overwrite and -reassure apply. But -overwrite "on" only triggers the behavior of -overwrite "nondir". I.e. directories cannot be deleted.</p><p>Access permissions of files in the ISO image do not restrict restoring. The directory permissions on disk have to allow rwx.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-osirrox</strong> setting[:option:...]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Setting "off" disables disk filesystem manipulations. This is the default unless the program was started with leafname "osirrox". Elsewise the capability to restore files can be enabled explicitly by -osirrox "on". It can be irrevocably disabled by -osirrox "banned".</p><p>The setting "blocked" is like "off". But it can only be revoked by setting "unblock", which elsewise is like "on". This can be used to curb command scripts which might use "on" undesiredly.</p><p>To enable restoring of special files by "device_files" is potentially dangerous. The meaning of the number st_rdev (see man 2 stat) depends much on the operating system. Best is to restore device files only to the same system from where they were copied. If not enabled, device files in the ISO image are ignored during restore operations.</p><p>Due to a bug of previous versions, device files from previous sessions might have been altered to major=0, minor=1. So this combination does not get restored.</p><p>Option "concat_split_on" is default. It enables restoring of split file directories as data files if the directory contains a complete collection of -cut_out part files. With option "concat_split_off" such directories are handled like any other ISO image directory.</p><p>Option "auto_chmod_off" is default. If "auto_chmod_on" is set then access restrictions for disk directories get circumvented if those directories are owned by the effective user who runs <strong>xorriso</strong>. This happens by temporarily granting rwx permission to the owner.</p><p>Option "sort_lba_on" may improve read performance with optical drives. It allows to restore large numbers of hard links without exhausting -temp_mem_limit. It does not preserve directory mtime and it needs -osirrox option auto_chmod_on in order to extract directories which offer no write permission. Default is "sort_lba_off".</p><p>Option "o_excl_on" is the default unless the program was started with leafname "osirrox". On GNU/Linux it tries to avoid using drives which are mounted or in use by other libburn programs. Option "o_excl_off" allows on GNU/Linux to access such drives. Drives which get acquired while "o_excl_off" will refuse to get blanked, formatted, written, or ejected. But be aware that even harmless inquiries can spoil ongoing burns of CD-R[W] and DVD-R[W].</p><p>Option "strict_acl_off" is default. It tolerates on FreeBSD the presence of directory "default" ACLs in the ISO image. With "strict_acl_on" these GNU/Linux ACLs cause on FreeBSD a FAILURE event during restore with -acl "on".</p>

<p>Writing of ISO 9660 on CD is traditionally done by program mkisofs as ISO 9660 image producer and cdrecord as burn program. <strong>xorriso</strong> does not strive for their comprehensive emulation. Nevertheless it is ready to perform some of its core tasks under control of commands which in said programs trigger comparable actions.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Perform the variable length option list as sparse emulation of the program depicted by the personality word.</p><p>Personality "<strong>mkisofs</strong>" accepts the options listed with:</p>
<pre>
  -as mkisofs -help --
</pre>
<p>Among them: -R (always on), -r, -J, -o, -M, -C, -dir-mode, -file-mode, -path-list, -m, -exclude-list, -f, -print-size, -pad, -no-pad, -V, -v, -version, -graft-points, -z, -no-emul-boot, -b, -c, -boot-info-table, -boot-load-size, -input-charset, -G, -output-charset, -U, -hide, -hide-joliet, -hide-list, -hide-joliet-list, file paths and pathspecs. A lot of options are not supported and lead to failure of the mkisofs emulation. Some are ignored, but better do not rely on this tolerance.</p><p>The supported options are documented in detail in xorrisofs.info and in man xorrisofs. The description here is focused on the effect of mkisofs emulation in the context of a <strong>xorriso</strong> run.</p><p>Other than with the "cdrecord" personality there is no automatic -commit at the end of a "mkisofs" option list. Verbosity settings -v (= "UPDATE") and -quiet (= "SORRY") persist. The output file persists until things happen like -commit, -rollback, -dev, or end of <strong>xorriso</strong>.</p><p>Options which affect all file objects in the ISO image, like -r or -dir-mode, will be applied only to files which are present in the ISO image when the command -as ends. If you use several -as mkisofs commands in the same run, then consider to put such options into the last -as command.</p><p>-pacifier gets set to "mkisofs" if files are added to the image.</p><p>-graft-points is equivalent to -pathspecs on. Note that pathspecs without "=" are interpreted differently than with <strong>xorriso</strong> command -add. Directories get merged with the root directory of the ISO image, other filetypes get mapped into that root directory.</p><p>If pathspecs are given and if no output file was chosen before or during the "mkisofs" option list, then standard output (-outdev "-") will get into effect. If -o points to a regular file, then it will be truncated to 0 bytes when finally writing begins. This truncation does not happen if the drive is chosen by <strong>xorriso</strong> commands before -as mkisofs or after its list delimiter. Directories and symbolic links are no valid -o targets.</p><p>Writing to stdout is possible only if -as "mkisofs" was among the start arguments or if other start arguments pointed the output drive to standard output.</p><p>-print-size inhibits automatic image production at program end. This ban is lifted only if the pending image changes get discarded.</p><p>Padding is counted as part of the ISO image if not option --emul-toc is given.</p><p>If no -iso-level is given, then level 1 is chosen when the first file or directory is added to the image. At the same occasion directory names get allowed to violate the standard by -compliance option allow_dir_id_ext. This may be avoided by option -disallow_dir_id_ext.</p><p>Option -root is supported. Option -old-root is implemented by <strong>xorriso</strong> commands -mkdir, -cp_clone, -find update_merge, and -find rm_merge. -root and -old-root set command -disk_dev_ino to "ino_only" and -md5 to "on", by default. -disk_dev_ino can be set to "off" by --old-root-no-ino resp. to "on" by --old-root-devno . -md5 can be set to "off" by --old-root-no-md5 .</p><p>Not original mkisofs options are --quoted_path_list , --hardlinks , --acl , --xattr , --md5 , --stdio_sync . They work like the <strong>xorriso</strong> commands with the same name and hardcoded parameter "on", e.g. -acl "on". Explicit parameters are expected by --stdio_sync and --scdbackup_tag.</p><p>The capability to preserve multi-session history on overwriteable media gets disabled by default. It can be enabled by using --emul-toc with the first session. See -compliance no_emul_toc.</p><p>--sort-weight gets as parameters a number and an iso_rr_path. The number becomes the LBA sorting weight of regular file iso_rr_path or of all regular files underneath directory iso_rr_path. (See -find -exec sort_weight).</p><p>Adopted from grub-mkisofs are --protective-msdos-label (see -boot_image grub partition_table=on) and --modification-date=YYYYMMDDhhmmsscc (see -volume_date uuid). For EFI bootable GRUB boot images use --efi-boot. It performs -boot_image grub efi_path= surrounded by two -boot_image "any" "next". Alternative option -e from Fedora genisoimage sets bin_path and platform_id for EFI, but performs no "next".</p><p>For MBR bootable ISOLINUX images there is -isohybrid-mbr FILE, where FILE is one of the Syslinux files mbr/isohdp[fp]x*.bin . Use this instead of -G to apply the effect of -boot_image isolinux partition_table=on.</p><p>--boot-catalog-hide is -boot_image any cat_hidden=on.</p><p>-mips-boot is the same as -boot_image any mips_path= .</p><p>-mipsel-boot leads to mipsel_path= .</p><p>-partition_offset number is -boot_image any partition_offset=number.</p><p>Command -append_partition is supported.</p><p>-untranslated_name_len number is -compliance untranslated_name_len=number.</p><p>--old-empty is -compliance old_empty.</p><p>The options of genisoimage Jigdo Template Extraction are recognized and performed via <strong>xorriso</strong> command -jigdo. See the "Alias:" names there for the meaning of the genisoimage options.</p><p>Personalities "<strong>xorrisofs</strong>", "<strong>genisoimage</strong>", and "<strong>genisofs</strong>" are aliases for "mkisofs".</p><p>If <strong>xorriso</strong> is started with one of the leafnames "xorrisofs", "genisofs", "mkisofs", or "genisoimage", then it performs -read_mkisofsrc and prepends -as "genisofs" to the program arguments. I.e. all arguments will be interpreted mkisofs style until "--" is encountered. From then on, arguments are interpreted as <strong>xorriso</strong> commands.</p><p>--no_rc as first argument of such a program start prevents interpretation of startup files. See section FILES below.</p><p>Personality "<strong>cdrecord</strong>" accepts the options listed with:</p>
<pre>
  -as cdrecord -help --

The medium gets closed if closing is applicable and not option -multi is present.</p><p>If an input drive was acquired, then it is given up. This is only allowed if no image changes are pending.</p><p>dev= must be given as <strong>xorriso</strong> device address. Addresses like 0,0,0 or ATA:1,1,0 are not supported.</p><p>If a track source is given, then an automatic -commit happens at the end of the "cdrecord" option list.</p><p>--grow_overwriteable_iso enables emulation of multi-session on overwriteable media.  To enable emulation of a TOC, the first session needs -C 0,32 with -as mkisofs (but no -M) and --grow_overwriteable_iso write_start_address=32s with -as cdrecord.</p><p>A much more elaborate libburn based cdrecord emulator is the program cdrskin.</p><p>Personalites "<strong>xorrecord</strong>", "<strong>wodim</strong>", and "<strong>cdrskin</strong>" are aliases for "cdrecord".</p><p>If <strong>xorriso</strong> is started with one of the leafnames "xorrecord", "cdrskin", "cdrecord", or "wodim", then it automatically prepends -as "cdrskin" to the program arguments.

The list begins by a line with the return value of Xorriso_sieve_get_result() with flag bit3. If this value is larger than 0, then the next line tells the number of names. The following lines show one name each.</p><p><strong>read_sieve</strong></p><p>Use the parameter_text as name of a filter rule and inquire its next recorded result. See Xorriso_sieve_big() for a list of names and reply strings.</p><p>The recorded strings are put out on result channel. They get wrapped into lines which tell their structure. The first line tells the return value of Xorriso_sieve_get_result(). The next line tells the number of strings. Each string begins by a line that tells the number of lines of the string. Then follow these lines. They are to be concatenated with a newline character inbetween each of them.

"'ISO session  :' '' 0 0 1"</p><p>The five parameter words are: prefix, separators, max_words, flag, number_of_input_lines. The former four are handed over to Xorriso_parse_line(). The number of input lines minus one tells xorriso how many newline characters are part of the input text.</p><p>The announced number of text lines will be read from dialog input, concatenated with a newline character inbetween each of them, and submitted to Xorriso_parse_line() as parameter line. Note that newlines outside of quotation marks are interpreted as separators if the separators parameter is empty.</p><p>The parsed strings are put out on result channel. They get wrapped into lines which tell their structure. The first line tells the return value of Xorriso_parse_line(). The next line tells the number of strings. Each string begins by a line that tells the number of lines of the string. Then follow these lines.

So the number_of_input_texts should not be extremely high. On the other hand, large transactions of command, input texts, and results are desirable if connection latency is an issue.</p><p><strong>parse_silently</strong></p><p>Like "parse" but not issueing a prompting message.

It is -1 if the first severity is lower than the second one.

<p>The frontend program should first send via its standard output:</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>It should be ready to decode -pkt_output and to react on -mark messages. Best is to increment the -mark number after each sent command sequence and then to wait for the new number to show up in a mark message:</p>

<pre>
  -report_about UPDATE -abort_on NEVER
</pre>

  -iso_rr_pattern off -disk_pattern off

<h3></h3>
<p><strong>As superuser learn about available drives</strong> On Linux or FreeBSD consider to give rw-permissions to those users or groups which shall be able to use the drives with <strong>xorriso</strong>. On Solaris use pfexec. Consider to restrict privileges of <strong>xorriso</strong> to "base,sys_devices" and to give r-permission to user or group.</p><p>$ xorriso -device_links</p><p>1  -dev '/dev/cdrom1' rwrw-- :  'TSSTcorp' 'DVD-ROM SH-D162C</p><p>1  -dev '/dev/cdrw'   rwrw-- :  'TSSTcorp' 'CDDVDW SH-S223B'</p><p>2  -dev '/dev/cdrw3'  rwrw-- :  'HL-DT-ST' 'BDDVDRW_GGC-H20L'</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Blank medium and compose a new ISO image as batch run</strong> Acquire drive /dev/sr2, make medium ready for writing a new image, fill the image with the files from hard disk directories /home/me/sounds and /home/me/pictures.</p><p>Because no -dialog "on" is given, the program will then end by writing the session to the medium.</p><p>$ xorriso -outdev /dev/sr2 &#92;</p><p> -blank as_needed &#92;</p><p> -map /home/me/sounds /sounds &#92;</p><p> -map /home/me/pictures /pictures</p><p>The ISO image may be shaped in a more elaborate way like the following: Omit some unwanted stuff by removing it from the image directory tree. Reintroduce some wanted stuff.</p><p>$ cd /home/me</p><p>$ xorriso -outdev /dev/sr2 &#92;</p><p> -blank as_needed &#92;</p><p> -map /home/me/sounds /sounds &#92;</p><p> -map /home/me/pictures /pictures &#92;</p><p> -rm_r &#92;</p>
<pre>
   /sounds/indecent &#92;

<pre>
   '/pictures/*private*' &#92;

<pre>
   /pictures/confidential &#92;
</pre>

<pre>

</pre>
<p> -cd / &#92;</p><p> -add pictures/confidential/work* --</p><p>Note that '/pictures/*private*' is a pattern for iso_rr_paths while pictures/confidential/work* gets expanded by the shell with addresses from the hard disk. Commands -add and -map have different parameter rules but finally the same effect: they put files into the image.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>A dialog session doing about the same</strong></p><p>Some settings are already given as start argument. The other activities are done as dialog input. The pager gets set to 20 lines of 80 characters.</p><p>The drive is acquired by command -dev rather than -outdev in order to see the message about its current content. By command -blank this content is made ready for being overwritten and the loaded ISO image is made empty.</p><p>In order to be able to eject the medium, the session needs to be committed explicitly.</p><p><strong>$ xorriso -dialog on -page 20 80 -disk_pattern on</strong></p><p>enter option and arguments :</p><p><strong>-dev /dev/sr2</strong></p><p>enter option and arguments :</p><p><strong>-blank as_needed</strong></p><p>enter option and arguments :</p><p><strong>-map /home/me/sounds /sounds -map /home/me/pictures /pictures</strong></p><p>enter option and arguments :</p><p><strong>-rm_r /sounds/indecent /pictures/*private* /pictures/confidential</strong></p><p>enter option and arguments :</p><p><strong>-cdx /home/me/pictures -cd /pictures</strong></p><p>enter option and arguments :</p><p><strong>-add confidential/office confidential/factory</strong></p><p>enter option and arguments :</p><p><strong>-du /</strong></p><p>enter option and arguments :</p><p><strong>-commit_eject all -end</strong></p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Manipulate an existing ISO image on the same medium</strong> Load image from drive. Remove (i.e. hide) directory /sounds and its subordinates. Rename directory /pictures/confidential to /pictures/restricted. Change access permissions of directory /pictures/restricted. Add new directory trees /sounds and /movies. Burn to the same medium, check whether the tree can be loaded, and eject.</p><p>$ xorriso -dev /dev/sr2 &#92;</p><p> -rm_r /sounds -- &#92;</p><p> -mv &#92;</p>
<pre>
   /pictures/confidential &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
   /pictures/restricted &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
   -- &#92;
</pre>
<p> -chmod go-rwx /pictures/restricted -- &#92;</p><p> -map /home/me/prepared_for_dvd/sounds_dummy /sounds &#92;</p><p> -map /home/me/prepared_for_dvd/movies /movies &#92;</p><p> -commit -eject all</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Copy modified ISO image from one medium to another</strong> Load image from input drive. Do the same manipulations as in the previous example. Acquire output drive and blank it. Burn the modified image as first and only session to the output drive.</p><p>$ xorriso -indev /dev/sr2 &#92;</p><p> -rm_r /sounds -- &#92;</p><p> ...</p><p> -outdev /dev/sr0 -blank as_needed &#92;</p><p> -commit -eject all</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Bring a prepared ISOLINUX tree onto medium and make it bootable</strong> The user has already created a suitable file tree on disk and copied the ISOLINUX files into subdirectory ./boot/isolinux of that tree. Now <strong>xorriso</strong> can burn an El Torito bootable medium:</p><p>$ xorriso -outdev /dev/sr0 -blank as_needed &#92;</p>
<pre>
   -map /home/me/ISOLINUX_prepared_tree / &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
   -boot_image isolinux dir=/boot/isolinux
</pre>

<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Change existing file name tree from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8</strong> This example assumes that the existing ISO image was written with character set ISO-8859-1 but that the readers expected UTF-8. Now a new session with the same files gets added with converted file names. In order to avoid any weaknesses of the local character set, this command pretends that it uses already the final target set UTF-8. Therefore strange file names may appear in messages, which will be made terminal-safe by command -backslash_codes.</p><p>$ xorriso -in_charset ISO-8859-1 -local_charset UTF-8 &#92;</p>
<pre>
   -out_charset UTF-8 -backslash_codes on -dev /dev/sr0 &#92;
</pre>

<pre>
   -alter_date m +0 / -- -commit -eject all
</pre>

<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Operate on storage facilities other than optical drives</strong> Full read-write operation is possible with regular files and block devices:</p><p>$ xorriso -dev /tmp/regular_file ...</p><p>Paths underneath /dev normally need prefix "stdio:"</p><p>$ xorriso -dev stdio:/dev/sdb ...</p><p>If /dev/sdb is to be used frequently and /dev/sda is the system disk, then consider to place the following lines in a <strong>xorriso</strong> Startup File. They allow to use /dev/sdb without prefix and protect disk /dev/sda from <strong>xorriso</strong>:</p>
<pre>
  -drive_class banned   /dev/sda*
</pre>

<pre>
  -drive_class harmless /dev/sdb
</pre>
<p>Other writeable file types are supported write-only:</p><p>$ xorriso -outdev /tmp/named_pipe ...</p><p>Among the write-only drives is standard output:</p><p>$ xorriso -outdev - &#92;</p><p> ...</p><p> | gzip &gt;image.iso.gz</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Burn an existing ISO image file to medium</strong> Actually this works with any kind of data, not only ISO images:</p><p>$ xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=as_needed image.iso</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Perform multi-session runs as of cdrtools traditions</strong> Between both processes there can be performed arbitrary transportation or filtering.</p><p>The first session is written like this:</p><p>$ xorriso -as mkisofs prepared_for_iso/tree1 | &#92;</p><p> xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=fast -multi -eject -</p><p>Follow-up sessions are written like this:</p><p>$ dd if=/dev/sr0 count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1</p><p>$ m=$(xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -msinfo)</p><p>$ xorriso -as mkisofs -M /dev/sr0 -C $m prepared_for_iso/tree2 | &#92;</p><p> xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 -waiti -multi -eject -</p><p>Always eject the drive tray between sessions. The old sessions get read via /dev/sr0. Its device driver might not be aware of the changed content before it loads the medium again. In this case the previous session would not be loaded and the new session would contain only the newly added files.</p><p>For the same reason do not let <strong>xorriso</strong> -as cdrecord load the medium, but rather do this manually or by a program that reads from /dev/sr0.</p><p>This example works for multi-session media only. Add cdrskin option --grow_overwriteable_iso to all -as cdrecord runs in order to enable multi-session emulation on overwriteable media.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Let xorriso work underneath growisofs</strong> growisofs expects an ISO formatter program which understands options -C and -M. If <strong>xorriso</strong> gets started by name "xorrisofs" then it is suitable for that.</p><p>$ export MKISOFS="xorrisofs"</p><p>$ growisofs -Z /dev/dvd /some/files</p><p>$ growisofs -M /dev/dvd /more/files</p><p>If no "xorrisofs" is available on your system, then you will have to create a link pointing to the <strong>xorriso</strong> binary and tell growisofs to use it. E.g. by:</p><p>$ ln -s $(which xorriso) "$HOME/xorrisofs"</p><p>$ export MKISOFS="$HOME/xorrisofs"</p><p>One may quit mkisofs emulation by argument "--" and make use of all <strong>xorriso</strong> commands. growisofs dislikes options which start with "-o" but -outdev must be set to "-". So use "outdev" instead:</p><p>$ growisofs -Z /dev/dvd -- outdev - -update_r /my/files /files</p><p>$ growisofs -M /dev/dvd -- outdev - -update_r /my/files /files</p><p>growisofs has excellent burn capabilities with DVD and BD. It does not emulate session history on overwriteable media, though.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Adjust thresholds for verbosity, exit value and program abort</strong> Be quite verbous, exit 32 if severity "FAILURE" was encountered, do not abort prematurely but forcibly go on until the end of commands.</p><p>$ xorriso ... &#92;</p><p> -report_about UPDATE &#92;</p><p> -return_with FAILURE 32 &#92;</p><p> -abort_on NEVER &#92;</p><p> ...</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Examples of input timestrings</strong></p><p>As printed by program date: <strong>'Thu Nov 8 14:51:13 CET 2007'</strong></p><p>The same without ignored parts: <strong>'Nov 8 14:51:13 2007'</strong></p><p>The same as expected by date: <strong>110814512007.13</strong></p><p>Four weeks in the future: <strong>+4w</strong></p><p>The current time: <strong>+0</strong></p><p>Three hours ago: <strong>-3h</strong></p><p>Seconds since Jan 1 1970: <strong>=1194531416</strong></p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Incremental backup of a few directory trees</strong> This changes the directory trees /projects and /personal_mail in the ISO image so that they become exact copies of their disk counterparts. ISO file objects get created, deleted or get their attributes adjusted accordingly.</p><p>ACL, xattr, hard links and MD5 checksums will be recorded. Accelerated comparison is enabled at the expense of potentially larger backup size. Only media with the expected volume ID or blank media are accepted. Files with names matching *.o or *.swp get excluded explicitly.</p><p>When done with writing the new session gets checked by its recorded MD5.</p><p>$ xorriso &#92;</p><p> -abort_on FATAL &#92;</p><p> -for_backup -disk_dev_ino on &#92;</p><p> -assert_volid 'PROJECTS_MAIL_*' FATAL &#92;</p><p> -dev /dev/sr0 &#92;</p><p> -volid PROJECTS_MAIL_"$(date '+%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S')" &#92;</p><p> -not_leaf '*.o' -not_leaf '*.swp' &#92;</p><p> -update_r /home/thomas/projects /projects &#92;</p><p> -update_r /home/thomas/personal_mail /personal_mail &#92;</p><p> -commit -toc -check_md5 FAILURE -- -eject all</p><p>To be used several times on the same medium, whenever an update of the two disk trees to the medium is desired. Begin with a blank medium and update it until the run fails gracefully due to lack of remaining space on the old one.</p><p>This makes sense if the full backup leaves substantial remaining capacity on media and if the expected changes are much smaller than the full backup. To apply zisofs compression to those data files which get newly copied from the local filesystem, insert these commands immediately before -commit :</p><p> -hardlinks perform_update &#92;</p><p> -find / -type f -pending_data -exec set_filter --zisofs -- &#92;</p><p>Commands -disk_dev_ino and -for_backup depend on stable device and inode numbers on disk. Without them, an update run may use -md5 "on" to match recorded MD5 sums against the current file content on hard disk. This is usually much faster than the default which compares both contents directly.</p><p>With <strong>mount</strong> option <strong>-o "sbsector="</strong> on GNU/Linux resp. <strong>-s</strong> on FreeBSD it is possible to access the session trees which represent the older backup versions. With CD media, GNU/Linux mount accepts session numbers directly by its option "session=".</p><p>Multi-session media and most overwriteable media written by <strong>xorriso</strong> can tell the sbsectors of their sessions by <strong>xorriso</strong> command -toc. Used after -commit the following command prints the matching mount command for the newly written session (here for mount point /mnt):</p><p> -mount_cmd "indev" "auto" "auto" /mnt</p><p>Commands -mount_cmd and -mount are also able to produce the mount commands for older sessions in the table-of-content. E.g. as superuser:</p><p> # osirrox -mount /dev/sr0 "volid" '*2008_12_05*' /mnt</p><p>Above example produces a result similar to  -root / -old-root / with mkisofs. For getting the session trees accumulated in the new sessions, let all -update commands use a common parent directory and clone it after updating is done:</p><p> -update_r /home/thomas/projects /current/projects &#92;</p><p> -update_r /home/thomas/personal_mail /current/personal_mail &#92;</p><p> -clone /current /"$(date '+%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S')" &#92;</p><p>The cloned tree will have a name like /2011_02_12_155700.</p><p>Sessions on multi-session media are separated by several MB of unused blocks. So with small sessions the payload capacity can become substantially lower than the overall media capacity. If the remaining space on a medium does not suffice for the next gap, the drive is supposed to close the medium automatically.</p><p><strong>Better do not use your youngest backup for -update_r</strong>. Have at least two media which you use alternatingly. So only older backups get endangered by the new write operation, while the newest backup is stored safely on a different medium.</p><p>Always have a blank medium ready to perform a full backup in case the update attempt fails due to insufficient remaining capacity. This failure will not spoil the old medium, of course.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Restore directory trees from a particular ISO session to disk</strong> This is an alternative to mounting the medium and using normal file operations.</p><p>First check which backup sessions are on the medium:</p><p>$ xorriso -outdev /dev/sr0 -toc</p><p>Then enable restoring of ACL, xattr and hard links. Load the desired session and copy the file trees to disk. Avoid to create /home/thomas/restored without rwx-permission.</p><p>$ xorriso -for_backup &#92;</p><p> -load volid 'PROJECTS_MAIL_2008_06_19*' &#92;</p><p> -indev /dev/sr0 &#92;</p><p> -osirrox on:auto_chmod_on &#92;</p><p> -chmod u+rwx / -- &#92;</p><p> -extract /projects /home/thomas/restored/projects &#92;</p><p> -extract /personal_mail /home/thomas/restored/personal_mail &#92;</p><p> -rollback_end</p><p>The final command -rollback_end prevents an error message about the altered image being discarded.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Try to retrieve blocks from a damaged medium</strong></p><p>$ xorriso -abort_on NEVER -indev /dev/sr0 &#92;</p><p> -check_media time_limit=1800 report=blocks_files &#92;</p><p> data_to="$HOME"/dvd_copy sector_map="$HOME"/dvd_copy.map --</p><p>This can be repeated several times, if necessary with -eject or with other -indev drives. See the human readable part of "$HOME"/dvd_copy.map for addresses which can be used on "$HOME"/dvd_copy with mount option -o sbsector= resp. -s.</p>

<p><strong>Program alias names:</strong></p><p>Normal installation of <strong>xorriso</strong> creates three links or copies which by their program name pre-select certain settings:</p><p><strong>xorrisofs</strong> starts <strong>xorriso</strong> with -as mkisofs emulation.</p><p><strong>xorrecord</strong> starts <strong>xorriso</strong> with -as cdrecord emulation.</p><p><strong>osirrox</strong> starts with -osirrox "on:o_excl_off" which allows to copy files from ISO image to disk and to apply command -mount to one or more of the existing ISO sessions.</p>
