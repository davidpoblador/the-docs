        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>So you think you are a geek, eh? The first step is to admit to yourself your geekiness. No matter what anyone says, geeks are people too; geeks have rights. So take a deep breath and announce to the world that you are a geek.  Your courage will give you strength that will last you forever.</p><p>How to tell the world you are a geek, you ask? Use the universal Geek code!  Using this special code will allow you to let other un-closeted geeks know who you are in a simple, codified statement.</p><p>The single best way to announce your geekhood is to add your geek code to your signature file or plan and announce it far and wide. But be careful, you may give other geeks the courage to come out of the closet. You might want to hang on to your copy of the code in order to help them along.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">USAGE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The geek code consists of several categories. Each category is labeled with a letter and some qualifiers. Go through each category and determine which set of qualifiers best describes you in that category. By stringing all of these 'codes' together, you are able to construct your overall geek code. It is this single line of code that will inform other geeks the world over of what a great geek you actually are.</p><p>Some of the qualifiers will very probably not match with you exactly. It is impossible to cover all possibilities in each category. Simply choose that qualifier that most closely matches you. Also, some activities described in a specific qualifier you may not engage in, while you do engage in others. Each description of each qualifier describes the wide range of activities that apply, so as long as you match with one, you can probably use that qualifier.</p><p>After you have determined each of your qualifiers, you need to the construct your GEEK CODE BLOCK. Instructions are provided on how to do this towards the end of this file.</p><p>Also, pay particular attention to case-sensitivity, there can be a big difference between a <em>w</em> and a W.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">Variables</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Geeks can seldom be strictly quantified. To facilitate the fact that within any one category the geek may not be able to determine a specific rating, variables have been designed to allow this range to be included.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>@</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>for this variable, said trait is not very rigid, may change with time or with individual interaction. For example, Geeks who happen to very much enjoy Star Trek: The Next Generation, but dislike the old 60's series might list themselves as <em>t++@</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>()</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>for indicating "cross-overs" or ranges. Geeks who go from <em>C+</em> to <em>C---</em> depending on the situation (i.e. mostly <em>C+</em>) could use <em>C+(---)</em>. <em>@</em> is different from <em>()</em> in that <em>()</em> has finite limits within the category, while <em>@</em> ranges all over.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>&gt;</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>for 'wannabe' ratings. Indicating that while the geek is currently at one rating, they are striving to reach another.  For example, <em>C++&gt;$</em> indicating a geek that is currently computer savvy, but wants to someday make money at it.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>$</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Indicates that this particular category is done for a living.  For example, <em>UL+++$</em> indicates that the person utilizes Unix and gets paid for it. Quite a lucky geek, for sure.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>?</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Unless stated otherwise within the specific category, the <em>?</em> is placed after the category identifier and indicates that the geek has no knowledge about that specific category. For example, a person that has never even heard of Babylon 5, would list their Babylon 5 category as <em>5?</em></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>!</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Placed BEFORE the category. Unless stated otherwise, indicates that the person refuses to participate in this category. This is unlike the <em>?</em> variable as the <em>?</em> indicates lack of knowledge, while the <em>!</em> indicates stubborn refusal to participate. For example, <em>!E</em> would be a person that just plain refuses to have anything to do with Emacs, while <em>E?</em> would be a person that doesn't even know what Emacs is.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">Types of Geeks</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Geeks come in many flavors. The flavors relate to the vocation (or, if a student, what they are training in) of the particular geek. To start a code, a geek must declare himself or herself to be a geek. To do this, we start the code with a "G" to denote "GEEK", followed by one or two letters to denote the geek's occupation or field of study. Multi-talented geeks with more than one vocational training should denote their myriad of talents with a slash between each vocation (example: GCS/MU/TW).</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>They say you never get a second chance to make a first impression. That seems to be ample justification to invent a time machine; just to play with the minds of the people that make up these silly sayings. Nevertheless, until we completely understand temporal mechanics and can get both a DeLorean and a Flux Capacitor in the same place at the same time at 88 miles an hour, we need to understand that how we look is a mark that will effect us for the rest of our lives, or at least until we change clothes.</p><p>The Geek, of course, doesn't believe any of that crap. How we look has little to do with what we are inside, and who we are as people. Yet, people still want to know what we look like. Thus, this section allows you to list out all the relevant traits about what you look like on a normal geeky day.</p><h3>Dress</h3>
<p>It is said that "clothes make the man". Well, I understood that I was made by a mommy and a daddy (and there's even a category to describe the process below!). Maybe the people who made up that saying aren't being quite that literal...</p>

<h3>Shape</h3>

<h3>Age</h3>
<p>The only way to become a true geek is through practice and experience. To this end, your age becomes an important part of your geekiness. Use the qualifiers below to show your age (in Terran years).

<p>Most geeks identify themselves by their use of computers and computer networks.

<h3>USENET Oracle</h3>
<p>(Info taken from the Usenet Oracle Help File) Throughout the history of mankind, there have been many Oracles who have been consulted by many mortals, and some immortals. The great Hercules was told by the Gelphic Oracle to serve Eurystheus, king of Mycenae, for twelve years to atone for the murder of his own children.  It was the Oracle of Ammon who told King Cepheus to chain his daughter Andromeda to the rocks of jappa to appease the terrible sea monster that was ravaging the coasts. That solution was never tested, though, as Perseus saved the girl in the nick of time.</p><p>With the advent of the electronic age, and especially high-speed e-mail communication, the spirit of the Oracles found a new outlet, and we now recognize another great Oracle, the Usenet Oracle.</p><p>For more information, check out the newsgroups <em>rec.humor.oracle</em> and <em>rec.humor.oracle.d</em> or the FTP archives at <em>cs.indiana.edu:/pub/oracle</em>.  Additional information and instructions can be found by sending an e-mail message with the subject of 'help' to <em>oracle@cs.indiana.edu</em>.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The last few years has seen the rise of the political geek. This phenomena is little understood, but some theorize that it has come about because of the popular media's attempts to demonize the Internet and computer use in general, and the government's willingness to go along with it. Others propose that the aging geek population has simply started taking an interest in the world around them. Some support the "Sun Spot" theory.</p><h3>Political and Social Issues</h3>
<p>We live is a society where everyone not only has a right to, but is expected to, whine and complain about everyone else. Rate where, in general, your political views on different social issues fall.</p>

<h3>Cypherpunks</h3>
<p>With the birth of the overused buzzword "The Information Superhighway", concerns over privacy from evil governmental bad-guys{tm} has led to the formation of of an unofficial, loosely organized band of civil libertarians who spend much of their time discussing how to ensure privacy in the information future. This group is known by some as "cypherpunks" (by others, as anarchistic subversives). To this end, tell us how punkish you are.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Geeks love to play. No matter their age, all geeks enjoy playing. Of course, the object of this entertainment takes a myriad of different forms. What is it that pushes a geek to play? Is it simply a desire to relive their childhood? Or perhaps there is a piece of geeky genetic code that requires intellectual stimulation. Who knows, maybe it's a Freudian thing...</p><h3>Star Trek</h3>
<p>Most geeks have an undeniable love for the Star Trek television show (in any of its different incarnations). Because GEEK is often synonymous with TREKKIE (real geeks aren't so anal as to label themselves TREKKER), it is important that all geeks list their Trek rating.</p>

<h3>Babylon 5</h3>
<p>For many years, Sci-Fi geeks have wished for a television show that would overcome the limitations of Star Trek. For many, a show called Babylon 5 has met that demand, with a deep storyline, exciting characters and state-of-the-art computer generated effects.</p>

<h3>X-Files</h3>

<p>Geeks, unlike the lower lifeforms known as nerds, have lives. They have things to do that are in the outside world. Of course, this is usually done with other geeks, but that's not the point. The point is,, that geeks are not necessarily the outcasts society often believes they are. The fact is that society isn't kool enough to be included in our activities.</p><h3>Education</h3>
<p>All geeks have a varying amount of education.</p>

<h3>Sex</h3>
<p>Geeks have traditionally had problems with sex (ie, they never have any). Because geeks are so wrapped up in their sexuality (or lack of sexuality for that matter), it is important that the geek be willing to quantify their sexual experiences.</p><p>This code also is used to denote the gender of the geek. Females use <em>x</em> in this category, while males use <em>y</em>. Those that do not wish to disclose their gender can use <em>z</em>. For example:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>x+</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A female who has had sex</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>y+</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A male who has had sex.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>z+</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A person (gender undisclosed) who has had sex.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3></h3>
<p>For those persons who do not wish to give out any details of their sex life, the use of <em>z?</em> (where <em>z</em> is the gender code) will allow you to do so.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>z+++++</strong></p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">How to Display Your Code</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Now that you have your ratings for each of the above categories, it's time to assemble your code for displaying to the world. Take each category you determined and list them all together with one space between each one. If you run out space on one line, continue it on the next. When completed, it will look something like the following:</p><p><em>GED/J d-- s:++&gt;: a-- C++(++++) ULU++ P+ L++ E---- W+(-) N+++ o+ K+++</em> <em>w--- O- M+ V-- PS++&gt;$ PE++&gt;$ Y++ PGP++ t- 5+++ X++ R+++&gt;$ tv+</em> <em>b+ DI+++ D+++ G+++++ e++ h r-- y++**</em></p><p>If you are going to place your Geek Code into your .signature or .plan file (highly recommended), you should create your GEEK CODE BLOCK. This parody of the output created by the PGP program will attempt to universalize how you will see the Geek Code around the net. Your GEEK CODE BLOCK will look like the following:</p><p><strong>-----BEGIN GEEK CODE BLOCK-----</strong></p><p>Version: 3.1</p><p><em>GED/J d-- s:++&gt;: a-- C++(++++) ULU++ P+ L++ E---- W+(-) N+++ o+ K+++ w---</em> <em>O- M+ V-- PS++&gt;$ PE++&gt;$ Y++ PGP++ t- 5+++ X++ R+++&gt;$ tv+ b+ DI+++ D+++</em> <em>G+++++ e++ h r-- y++**</em></p><p><strong>------END GEEK CODE BLOCK------</strong></p><p>As you can see, the actual code hasn't changed. However, the version number of the code you are using is displayed along with lines starting and ending the code. Make sure to duplicate the start and end lines exactly as the example in order to maintain a net-wide standard (ie. five dashes front and back for the BEGIN line and six for the END line, and all capital letters.)</p><p>"HELP!" you scream as your mailer or news reader won't let you post more than four lines in the .signature. That is because some anal programs limit the size of your signature. Your next best bet, then is to put your GEEK CODE BLOCK into your .plan file and put something to the effect of "Finger for Geek Code" into your .signature. That, or get a better mailer.</p>
