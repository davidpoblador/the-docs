<p>See also: ignore, remove</p><p>Add specified files or directories.</p><p>In non-recursive mode, all the named items are added, regardless of whether they were previously ignored.  A warning is given if any of the named files are already versioned.</p><p>In recursive mode (the default), files are treated the same way but the behaviour for directories is different.  Directories that are already versioned do not give a warning.  All directories, whether already versioned or not, are searched for files or subdirectories that are neither versioned or ignored, and these are added.  This search proceeds recursively into versioned directories.  If no names are given &apos;.&apos; is assumed.</p><p>A warning will be printed when nested trees are encountered, unless they are explicitly ignored.</p><p>Therefore simply saying &apos;bzr add&apos; will version all files that are currently unknown.</p><p>Adding a file whose parent directory is not versioned will implicitly add the parent, and so on up to the root. This means you should never need to explicitly add a directory, they&apos;ll just get added when you add a file in the directory.</p><p>--dry-run will show which files would be added, but not actually add them.</p><p>--file-ids-from will try to use the file ids from the supplied path. It looks up ids trying to find a matching parent directory with the same filename, and then by pure path. This option is rarely needed but can be useful when adding the same logical file into two branches that will be merged later (without showing the two different adds as a conflict). It is also useful when merging another project into a subdirectory of this one.</p><p>Any files matching patterns in the ignore list will not be added unless they are explicitly mentioned.</p><p>In recursive mode, files larger than the configuration option add.maximum_file_size will be skipped. Named items are never skipped due to file size.</p>

<p>Aliases: ci, checkin</p><p>See also: add, bugs, hooks, uncommit</p><p>Commit changes into a new revision.</p><p>An explanatory message needs to be given for each commit. This is often done by using the --message option (getting the message from the command line) or by using the --file option (getting the message from a file). If neither of these options is given, an editor is opened for the user to enter the message. To see the changed files in the boilerplate text loaded into the editor, use the --show-diff option.</p><p>By default, the entire tree is committed and the person doing the commit is assumed to be the author. These defaults can be overridden as explained below.</p><p>Selective commits:</p>
<pre>
  If selected files are specified, only changes to those files are
  committed.  If a directory is specified then the directory and
  everything within it is committed.
</pre>

<pre>
  When excludes are given, they take precedence over selected files.
  For example, to commit only changes within foo, but not changes
  within foo/bar:
</pre>

<pre>
    bzr commit foo -x foo/bar
</pre>

<pre>
  A selective commit after a merge is not yet supported.
</pre>
<p>Custom authors:</p>
<pre>
  If the author of the change is not the same person as the committer,
  you can specify the author&apos;s name using the --author option. The
  name should be in the same format as a committer-id, e.g.
  "John Doe &lt;jdoe@example.com&gt;". If there is more than one author of
  the change you can specify the option multiple times, once for each
  author.
</pre>
<p>Checks:</p>
<pre>
  A common mistake is to forget to add a new file or directory before
  running the commit command. The --strict option checks for unknown
  files and aborts the commit if any are found. More advanced pre-commit
  checks can be implemented by defining hooks. See &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr help hooks&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq
  for details.
</pre>
<p>Things to note:</p>
<pre>
  If you accidentially commit the wrong changes or make a spelling
  mistake in the commit message say, you can use the uncommit command
  to undo it. See &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr help uncommit&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq for details.
</pre>

<pre>
  Hooks can also be configured to run after a commit. This allows you
  to trigger updates to external systems like bug trackers. The --fixes
  option can be used to record the association between a revision and
  one or more bugs. See &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr help bugs&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq for details.

</pre>
<p>See also: log-formats, revisionspec</p><p>Show historical log for a branch or subset of a branch.</p><p>log is bzr&apos;s default tool for exploring the history of a branch. The branch to use is taken from the first parameter. If no parameters are given, the branch containing the working directory is logged. Here are some simple examples:</p>
<pre>
  bzr log                       log the current branch
  bzr log foo.py                log a file in its branch
  bzr log http://server/branch  log a branch on a server
</pre>
<p>The filtering, ordering and information shown for each revision can be controlled as explained below. By default, all revisions are shown sorted (topologically) so that newer revisions appear before older ones and descendants always appear before ancestors. If displayed, merged revisions are shown indented under the revision in which they were merged.</p><p>Output control:</p>
<pre>
  The log format controls how information about each revision is
  displayed. The standard log formats are called &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqlong&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq, &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqshort&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq
  and &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqline&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq. The default is long. See &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr help log-formats&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq
  for more details on log formats.
</pre>

<pre>
  The following options can be used to control what information is
  displayed:
</pre>

<pre>
    -l N        display a maximum of N revisions
    -n N        display N levels of revisions (0 for all, 1 for collapsed)
    -v          display a status summary (delta) for each revision
    -p          display a diff (patch) for each revision
    --show-ids  display revision-ids (and file-ids), not just revnos
</pre>

<pre>
  Note that the default number of levels to display is a function of the
  log format. If the -n option is not used, the standard log formats show
  just the top level (mainline).
</pre>

<pre>
  Status summaries are shown using status flags like A, M, etc. To see
  the changes explained using words like &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqadded&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq and &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqmodified&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq
  instead, use the -vv option.
</pre>
<p>Ordering control:</p>
<pre>
  To display revisions from oldest to newest, use the --forward option.
  In most cases, using this option will have little impact on the total
  time taken to produce a log, though --forward does not incrementally
  display revisions like --reverse does when it can.
</pre>
<p>Revision filtering:</p>
<pre>
  The -r option can be used to specify what revision or range of revisions
  to filter against. The various forms are shown below:
</pre>

<pre>
    -rX      display revision X
    -rX..    display revision X and later
    -r..Y    display up to and including revision Y
    -rX..Y   display from X to Y inclusive
</pre>

<pre>
  See &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr help revisionspec&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq for details on how to specify X and Y.
  Some common examples are given below:
</pre>

<pre>
    -r-1                show just the tip
    -r-10..             show the last 10 mainline revisions
    -rsubmit:..         show what&apos;s new on this branch
    -rancestor:path..   show changes since the common ancestor of this
                        branch and the one at location path
    -rdate:yesterday..  show changes since yesterday
</pre>

<pre>
  When logging a range of revisions using -rX..Y, log starts at
  revision Y and searches back in history through the primary
  ("left-hand") parents until it finds X. When logging just the
  top level (using -n1), an error is reported if X is not found
  along the way. If multi-level logging is used (-n0), X may be
  a nested merge revision and the log will be truncated accordingly.
</pre>
<p>Path filtering:</p>
<pre>
  If parameters are given and the first one is not a branch, the log
  will be filtered to show only those revisions that changed the
  nominated files or directories.
</pre>

<pre>
  Filenames are interpreted within their historical context. To log a
  deleted file, specify a revision range so that the file existed at
  the end or start of the range.
</pre>

<pre>
  Historical context is also important when interpreting pathnames of
  renamed files/directories. Consider the following example:
</pre>

<pre>
  * revision 1: add tutorial.txt
  * revision 2: modify tutorial.txt
  * revision 3: rename tutorial.txt to guide.txt; add tutorial.txt
</pre>

<pre>
  In this case:
</pre>

<pre>
  * &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr log guide.txt&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq will log the file added in revision 1
</pre>

<pre>
  * &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr log tutorial.txt&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq will log the new file added in revision 3
</pre>

<pre>
  * &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr log -r2 -p tutorial.txt&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq will show the changes made to
    the original file in revision 2.
</pre>

<pre>
  * &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr log -r2 -p guide.txt&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq will display an error message as there
    was no file called guide.txt in revision 2.
</pre>

<pre>
  Renames are always followed by log. By design, there is no need to
  explicitly ask for this (and no way to stop logging a file back
  until it was last renamed).
</pre>
<p>Other filtering:</p>
<pre>
  The --match option can be used for finding revisions that match a
  regular expression in a commit message, committer, author or bug.
  Specifying the option several times will match any of the supplied
  expressions. --match-author, --match-bugs, --match-committer and
  --match-message can be used to only match a specific field.
</pre>
<p>Tips & tricks:</p>
<pre>
  GUI tools and IDEs are often better at exploring history than command
  line tools: you may prefer qlog or viz from qbzr or bzr-gtk, the
  bzr-explorer shell, or the Loggerhead web interface.  See the Plugin
  Guide &lt;http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/plugins/en/&gt; and
  &lt;http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/IDEIntegration&gt;.
</pre>

<pre>
  You may find it useful to add the aliases below to &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbazaar.conf&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq:
</pre>

<pre>
    [ALIASES]
    tip = log -r-1
    top = log -l10 --line
    show = log -v -p
</pre>

<pre>
  &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr tip&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq will then show the latest revision while &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr top&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq
  will show the last 10 mainline revisions. To see the details of a
  particular revision X,  &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr show -rX&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq.
</pre>

<pre>
  If you are interested in looking deeper into a particular merge X,
  use &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr log -n0 -rX&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq.
</pre>

<pre>
  &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr log -v&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq on a branch with lots of history is currently
  very slow. A fix for this issue is currently under development.
  With or without that fix, it is recommended that a revision range
  be given when using the -v option.
</pre>

<pre>
  bzr has a generic full-text matching plugin, bzr-search, that can be
  used to find revisions matching user names, commit messages, etc.
  Among other features, this plugin can find all revisions containing
  a list of words but not others.
</pre>

<pre>
  When exploring non-mainline history on large projects with deep
  history, the performance of log can be greatly improved by installing
  the historycache plugin. This plugin buffers historical information
  trading disk space for faster speed.

<p>See also: remerge, send, status-flags, update</p><p>Perform a three-way merge.</p><p>The source of the merge can be specified either in the form of a branch, or in the form of a path to a file containing a merge directive generated with bzr send. If neither is specified, the default is the upstream branch or the branch most recently merged using --remember.  The source of the merge may also be specified in the form of a path to a file in another branch:  in this case, only the modifications to that file are merged into the current working tree.</p><p>When merging from a branch, by default bzr will try to merge in all new work from the other branch, automatically determining an appropriate base revision.  If this fails, you may need to give an explicit base.</p><p>To pick a different ending revision, pass "--revision OTHER".  bzr will try to merge in all new work up to and including revision OTHER.</p><p>If you specify two values, "--revision BASE..OTHER", only revisions BASE through OTHER, excluding BASE but including OTHER, will be merged.  If this causes some revisions to be skipped, i.e. if the destination branch does not already contain revision BASE, such a merge is commonly referred to as a "cherrypick". Unlike a normal merge, Bazaar does not currently track cherrypicks. The changes look like a normal commit, and the history of the changes from the other branch is not stored in the commit.</p><p>Revision numbers are always relative to the source branch.</p><p>Merge will do its best to combine the changes in two branches, but there are some kinds of problems only a human can fix.  When it encounters those, it will mark a conflict.  A conflict means that you need to fix something, before you can commit.</p><p>Use bzr resolve when you have fixed a problem.  See also bzr conflicts.</p><p>If there is no default branch set, the first merge will set it (use --no-remember to avoid setting it). After that, you can omit the branch to use the default.  To change the default, use --remember. The value will only be saved if the remote location can be accessed.</p><p>The results of the merge are placed into the destination working directory, where they can be reviewed (with bzr diff), tested, and then committed to record the result of the merge.</p><p>merge refuses to run if there are any uncommitted changes, unless --force is given.  If --force is given, then the changes from the source will be merged with the current working tree, including any uncommitted changes in the tree.  The --force option can also be used to create a merge revision which has more than two parents.</p><p>If one would like to merge changes from the working tree of the other branch without merging any committed revisions, the --uncommitted option can be given.</p><p>To select only some changes to merge, use "merge -i", which will prompt you to apply each diff hunk and file change, similar to "shelve".</p><p>Examples:</p>

    bzr mv SOURCE... DESTINATION
</pre>
<p>If the last argument is a versioned directory, all the other names are moved into it.  Otherwise, there must be exactly two arguments and the file is changed to a new name.</p><p>If OLDNAME does not exist on the filesystem but is versioned and NEWNAME does exist on the filesystem but is not versioned, mv assumes that the file has been manually moved and only updates its internal inventory to reflect that change. The same is valid when moving many SOURCE files to a DESTINATION.</p><p>Files cannot be moved between branches.</p>

<p>See also: cat, export, merge, shelve</p><p>Set files in the working tree back to the contents of a previous revision.</p><p>Giving a list of files will revert only those files.  Otherwise, all files will be reverted.  If the revision is not specified with &apos;--revision&apos;, the working tree basis revision is used. A revert operation affects only the working tree, not any revision history like the branch and repository or the working tree basis revision.</p><p>To remove only some changes, without reverting to a prior version, use merge instead.  For example, "merge . -r -2..-3" (don&apos;t forget the ".") will remove the changes introduced by the second last commit (-2), without affecting the changes introduced by the last commit (-1).  To remove certain changes on a hunk-by-hunk basis, see the shelve command. To update the branch to a specific revision or the latest revision and update the working tree accordingly while preserving local changes, see the update command.</p><p>Uncommitted changes to files that are reverted will be discarded. Howver, by default, any files that have been manually changed will be backed up first.  (Files changed only by merge are not backed up.)  Backup files have &apos;.~#~&apos; appended to their name, where # is a number.</p><p>When you provide files, you can use their current pathname or the pathname from the target revision.  So you can use revert to "undelete" a file by name.  If you name a directory, all the contents of that directory will be reverted.</p><p>If you have newly added files since the target revision, they will be removed.  If the files to be removed have been changed, backups will be created as above.  Directories containing unknown files will not be deleted.</p><p>The working tree contains a list of revisions that have been merged but not yet committed. These revisions will be included as additional parents of the next commit.  Normally, using revert clears that list as well as reverting the files.  If any files are specified, revert leaves the list of uncommitted merges alone and reverts only the files.  Use &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr revert.&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq in the tree root to revert all files but keep the recorded merges, and &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqbzr revert --forget-merges&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq to clear the pending merge list without reverting any files.</p><p>Using "bzr revert --forget-merges", it is possible to apply all of the changes from a branch in a single revision.  To do this, perform the merge as desired.  Then doing revert with the "--forget-merges" option will keep the content of the tree as it was, but it will clear the list of pending merges.  The next commit will then contain all of the changes that are present in the other branch, but without any other parent revisions. Because this technique forgets where these changes originated, it may cause additional conflicts on later merges involving the same source and target branches.</p>

<p>&#92;*(Aqbzr send&#92;*(Aq creates a compact data set that, when applied using bzr merge, has the same effect as merging from the source branch.</p><p>By default the merge directive is self-contained and can be applied to any branch containing submit_branch in its ancestory without needing access to the source branch.</p><p>If --no-bundle is specified, then Bazaar doesn&apos;t send the contents of the revisions, but only a structured request to merge from the public_location.  In that case the public_branch is needed and it must be up-to-date and accessible to the recipient.  The public_branch is always included if known, so that people can check it later.</p><p>The submit branch defaults to the parent of the source branch, but can be overridden.  Both submit branch and public branch will be remembered in branch.conf the first time they are used for a particular branch.  The source branch defaults to that containing the working directory, but can be changed using --from.</p><p>Both the submit branch and the public branch follow the usual behavior with respect to --remember: If there is no default location set, the first send will set it (use --no-remember to avoid setting it). After that, you can omit the location to use the default.  To change the default, use --remember. The value will only be saved if the location can be accessed.</p><p>In order to calculate those changes, bzr must analyse the submit branch. Therefore it is most efficient for the submit branch to be a local mirror. If a public location is known for the submit_branch, that location is used in the merge directive.</p><p>The default behaviour is to send the merge directive by mail, unless -o is given, in which case it is sent to a file.</p><p>Mail is sent using your preferred mail program.  This should be transparent on Windows (it uses MAPI).  On Unix, it requires the xdg-email utility. If the preferred client can&apos;t be found (or used), your editor will be used.</p><p>To use a specific mail program, set the mail_client configuration option. (For Thunderbird 1.5, this works around some bugs.)  Supported values for specific clients are "claws", "evolution", "kmail", "mail.app" (MacOS X&apos;s Mail.app), "mutt", and "thunderbird"; generic options are "default", "editor", "emacsclient", "mapi", and "xdg-email".  Plugins may also add supported clients.</p><p>If mail is being sent, a to address is required.  This can be supplied either on the commandline, by setting the submit_to configuration option in the branch itself or the child_submit_to configuration option in the submit branch.</p><p>Two formats are currently supported: "4" uses revision bundle format 4 and merge directive format 2.  It is significantly faster and smaller than older formats.  It is compatible with Bazaar 0.19 and later.  It is the default.  "0.9" uses revision bundle format 0.9 and merge directive format 1.  It is compatible with Bazaar 0.12 - 0.18.</p><p>The merge directives created by bzr send may be applied using bzr merge or bzr pull by specifying a file containing a merge directive as the location.</p><p>bzr send makes extensive use of public locations to map local locations into URLs that can be used by other people.

<p>removed</p>
<pre>
    Versioned in the previous revision but removed or deleted
    in the working copy.
</pre>
<p>renamed</p>
<pre>
    Path of this file changed from the previous revision;
    the text may also have changed.  This includes files whose

<p>modified</p>
<pre>
    Text has changed since the previous revision.
</pre>
<p>kind changed</p>
<pre>
    File kind has been changed (e.g. from file to directory).
</pre>
<p>unknown</p>
<pre>
    Not versioned and not matching an ignore pattern.
</pre>
<p>Additionally for directories, symlinks and files with a changed executable bit, Bazaar indicates their type using a trailing character: &apos;/&apos;, &apos;@&apos; or &apos;*&apos; respectively. These decorations can be disabled using the &apos;--no-classify&apos; option.</p><p>To see ignored files use &apos;bzr ignored&apos;.  For details on the changes to file texts, use &apos;bzr diff&apos;.</p><p>Note that --short or -S gives status flags for each item, similar to Subversion&apos;s status command. To get output similar to svn -q, use bzr status -SV.</p><p>If no arguments are specified, the status of the entire working directory is shown.  Otherwise, only the status of the specified files or directories is reported.  If a directory is given, status is reported for everything inside that directory.</p><p>Before merges are committed, the pending merge tip revisions are shown. To see all pending merge revisions, use the -v option. To skip the display of pending merge information altogether, use the no-pending option or specify a file/directory.</p><p>To compare the working directory to a specific revision, pass a single revision to the revision argument.</p><p>To see which files have changed in a specific revision, or between two revisions, pass a revision range to the revision argument. This will produce the same results as calling &apos;bzr diff --summarize&apos;.</p>

<p>Set the branch of a checkout and update.</p><p>For lightweight checkouts, this changes the branch being referenced. For heavyweight checkouts, this checks that there are no local commits versus the current bound branch, then it makes the local branch a mirror of the new location and binds to it.</p><p>In both cases, the working tree is updated and uncommitted changes are merged. The user can commit or revert these as they desire.</p><p>Pending merges need to be committed or reverted before using switch.</p><p>The path to the branch to switch to can be specified relative to the parent directory of the current branch. For example, if you are currently in a checkout of /path/to/branch, specifying &apos;newbranch&apos; will find a branch at /path/to/newbranch.</p><p>Bound branches use the nickname of its master branch unless it is set locally, in which case switching will update the local nickname to be that of the master.</p>

<p>See also: check, formats, reconcile</p><p>Upgrade a repository, branch or working tree to a newer format.</p><p>When the default format has changed after a major new release of Bazaar, you may be informed during certain operations that you should upgrade. Upgrading to a newer format may improve performance or make new features available. It may however limit interoperability with older repositories or with older versions of Bazaar.</p><p>If you wish to upgrade to a particular format rather than the current default, that can be specified using the --format option. As a consequence, you can use the upgrade command this way to "downgrade" to an earlier format, though some conversions are a one way process (e.g. changing from the 1.x default to the 2.x default) so downgrading is not always possible.</p><p>A backup.bzr.~#~ directory is created at the start of the conversion process (where # is a number). By default, this is left there on completion. If the conversion fails, delete the new .bzr directory and rename this one back in its place. Use the --clean option to ask for the backup.bzr directory to be removed on successful conversion. Alternatively, you can delete it by hand if everything looks good afterwards.</p><p>If the location given is a shared repository, dependent branches are also converted provided the repository converts successfully. If the conversion of a branch fails, remaining branches are still tried.</p><p>For more information on upgrades, see the Bazaar Upgrade Guide, http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/latest/en/upgrade-guide/.</p>

<p>Manage filtered views.</p><p>Views provide a mask over the tree so that users can focus on a subset of a tree when doing their work. After creating a view, commands that support a list of files - status, diff, commit, etc - effectively have that list of files implicitly given each time. An explicit list of files can still be given but those files must be within the current view.</p><p>In most cases, a view has a short life-span: it is created to make a selected change and is deleted once that change is committed. At other times, you may wish to create one or more named views and switch between them.</p><p>To disable the current view without deleting it, you can switch to the pseudo view called &#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aqoff&#92;*(Aq&#92;*(Aq. This can be useful when you need to see the whole tree for an operation or two (e.g. merge) but want to switch back to your view after that.</p><p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
  To define the current view:
</pre>

<pre>
    bzr view file1 dir1 ...
</pre>

<pre>
  To list the current view:
</pre>

<pre>
    bzr view
</pre>

<pre>
  To delete the current view:
</pre>

<pre>
    bzr view --delete
</pre>

<pre>
  To disable the current view without deleting it:
</pre>

<pre>
    bzr view --switch off
</pre>

<pre>
  To define a named view and switch to it:
</pre>

<pre>
    bzr view --name view-name file1 dir1 ...
</pre>

<pre>
  To list a named view:
</pre>

<pre>
