        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><em>sunclock</em> is an X11 application that displays a map of the Earth and shows the illuminated portion of the globe.  In addition to providing local time for the default timezone, it also displays GMT time, legal and solar time of major cities, their latitude and longitude, the mutual distances of arbitrary locations on Earth, the position at zenith of Sun and Moon. Sunclock can display meridians, parallels, tropics and arctic circles. It has builtin functions that accelerate the speed of time and show the evolution of seasons. Sunclock can be internationalized for various western languages. It is possible to customize the app-default file and enter additional city entries.</p><p>Sunclock can commute between two states, the "clock window" and the "map window". The clock window displays a small map of the Earth and therefore occupies little space on the screen, while the "map window" displays a large map and offers more advanced functions. The Sunclock package includes a resizable and zoomable vector map . External Earth maps can also be loaded (starting with version 3.51, formats .jpg, .gif, .png, .xpm or .xpm.gz, .vmf can be read [.vmf is the specific vector map format of  sunclock]). Some additional formats could be added in the future.</p><p>The map window can work in five different modes:</p><p>- "Legal time" mode: legal time of default time zone and GMT time are displayed.</p><p>- "Coordinate" mode: by clicking on a city, users get coordinates (latitude, longitude) of that city, legal time and sunrise/sunset.</p><p>- "Solar" mode: by clicking on a point of the map (either a city or another point), solar time and day length are shown.</p><p>- "Hour Extension" mode: displays solar times from 00:00 to 23:00 in bottom strip, according to the Sun position.</p><p>- "Distance" mode: shows distances in km and miles between two arbitrary locations.</p><p>Depending on the mode chosen, the bottom line shows a short text displaying the requested information. The bottom line can be scrolled to the right or to the left by pressing the PageUp/PageDown and Home/End key arrows.</p><p>A further functionality is the "Progress" feature, which allows one to accelerate the evolution of time, so as to observe the evolution of day/night periods and seasons. By default, the Sun and Moon are also shown on the map (rather, the positions of Earth where Sun and Moon are at zenith are shown).  Coordinates of meridians, parallels, cities, the names of cities can be displayed on the map.</p><p>All functionalities can be accessed though GUI actions on the main window or the auxiliary windows. The main window is resizable by pulling the window edges - as the current window manager permits it. There are 5 auxiliary windows:</p><p>- Menu Window. This is the main menu, which offers a wide list of actions. The menu window is launched by typing 'H' or clicking on the bottom strip with the left mouse button once. Each action can be obtained by using the indicated keyboard shortcut or by clicking with the mouse on the corresponding entry. Upper/lower case is irrelevant, except for options or actions which have more than 2 switches. Lower case then rotates the switches in one direction, upper case in the other direction. For those switches, the left mouse button will have the same effect as lower case, and the right mouse button the same effect as upper case.</p><p>- File Selector window. It can be accessed by clicking on the upper part of the main window with the middle mouse button. It allows one to select the Earth image file (in formats *.vmf *.xpm, *.xpm.gz, *.jpg, *.gif, *.png) to be loaded.</p><p>- Zoom window. It can be accessed by clicking on the upper part of the main window with the right mouse button. The zoom window allows one to select a specific area on the Earth, to translate or zoom it up to 100 times. High resolutions (larger than 10) are only recommended with the "huge" Earthmap of 11 Mbytes, which offers clean images up to 20 times magnification at least.</p><p>- Urban selector window. Allows one to modify interactively the list of shown cities and locations.</p><p>- Option window. Allows one to reconfigure pretty much everything on the fly (colors, fonts, etc), exactly as with the command line options.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The program does not use the Xt nor any other more advanced toolkit, and hence only (!) those options explicitly enumerated below may be used. The only needed resource is the list of coordinates and timezones of cities to be displayed. The system administrator can possibly customize the system-wide prepackaged config file Sunclockrc before installing the package, while users can tweak their individual configuration file ~/.sunclockrc at any time. The individual config file ~/.sunclockrc is read *after* the system wide config file Sunclockrc, and therefore its settings override those of the system wide config. The command line options can be used to override ~/.sunclockrc itself.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-help </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Show brief help and exit.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-listmenu </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Explanations on the actions available from the builtin menu.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-version </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Show program version and exit.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-verbose </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Make Sunclock verbose. The program then sends to stderr some information on the internal operations performed. This is disabled by default.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-silent </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Make Sunclock silent about internal operations performed. This is the default.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-citycheck </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>At start-up, check that there are no repetitions in the list of cities (a city is considered to be repeated if it appears twice under the same name, with coordinates differing by at most 0.5 degree). By default no check is performed on Sunclockrc - which is supposedly correctly set up...</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-display  dispname</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Give the name of the X server to contact.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-language  name</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Select language to be used in the sunclock menu and help.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-title name</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change the specification of the string which should appear in the title bar of the main and auxiliary windows. Default is the application name, i.e., sunclock.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-classname name</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Change the specification of class application name. Default is Sunclock. Other specifications can be passed so that aware window managers might use it for configuration purposes. You might e.g. pass -classname NoTitle-Sticky, and configure properly your WM so that it removes the title bar, and make the window sticky with respect to the Desktop Pager. With fvwm, you could use for instance</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Style "*NoTitle*"    NoTitle, WindowListHit, Sticky</p><p>Style "*ShowTitle*"  Title, WindowListHit, Slippery</p><p>Style "*Sticky*"     Sticky</p><p>to specify such a behaviour.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-setfont  &lt;field&gt;|&lt;fontsetting&gt;{|&lt;languages&gt;}</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Select the font for the given text field (clockstrip, menustrip, city, coord, menu). Optionally, one can specify a list of languages for which this font setting should apply. If the &lt;languages&gt; option is not specified, the font setting applies to all languages.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-rcfile  filename</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Read a configuration file that is different from the user default ~/.sunclockrc (if this option is not set, the user config file defaults to ~/.sunclockrc). Notice that the app-default config file Sunclockrc is read first, and the file set by the -rcfile option is read afterwards; therefore its settings override those set by the system wide config file. Reading further config files is possible at runtime, using the option window. Set -rcfile with a void string "" if you wish to bypass the user config file step.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-sharedir  directory</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the directory where system wide shared Earthmaps are located. Default is /usr/share/sunclock/earthmaps.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-image  *.jpg (or *.gif, *.png, *.vmf, *.xpm, *.xpm.gz)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Start sunclock with an Earth map image loaded in the clock and map windows. The same map is then used for both windows, but the clock image is usually scaled down.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-mapimage  *.jpg (or *.gif, *.png, *.vmf, *.xpm, *.xpm.gz)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Start sunclock with an Earth map image loaded in the map window.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-clockimage  *.jpg (or *.gif, *.png, *.vmf, *.xpm, *.xpm.gz)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Start sunclock with an Earth map image loaded in the clock window.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-zoomimage  *.jpg (or *.gif, *.png, *.vmf, *.xpm, *.xpm.gz)</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use specified file as image in the zoom widget</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-colorlevel  level=0,1,2,3</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Sets the color level (0=monochrome, 1=few colors, 2=many colors, 3=full colors). With the "monochrome" setting, day and night appear respectively as mapbgcolor (white by default) and mapfgcolor (black by default), and no shading is available; all other features (city names, coordinates) appear also as monochrome. With the "few colors" setting, the menus and city spots can be represented with dedicated colors, but the meridians/parallels/tropics are still monochrome. With the "many colors" oprions, meridians/parallels/tropics can also be drawn in color. In these first 3 modes, only .vmf vector maps can be loaded. These modes save a lot of CPU power - since a simple algorithm of inversion of colors is used to set colors of all points in the map. Monochrome mode can be useful for very slow CPUs, such as those in use in PDAs with black and white screen. The full color mode (level=3) allows one to load jpeg or other colorful images; day and night can be drawn with various shading parameters. This is the default and recommended mode if you have a reasonably recent machine with enough video RAM.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-dock </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option is meant to give sunclock the ability to be docked in the window manager buttons or menu bar, providing that the WM offers this possibility without requiring special hints (fvwm2 or windowmaker or afterstep will work perfectly well for that purpose, KDE or Gnome won't...) Under the -dock option, sunclock locks the size of the first launched window, which is necessarily a small clock. Also, that initial window can no longer be closed by typing 'K' or 'Q'. (The only way to exit the application, then, is to kill it with xkill, or to undock it first with the -undock option from the Option window). The user might want to customize the size and suitable options so that sunclock fits with the size of the dockable applets. As an example, sunclock could be invoked as follows:</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong> </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>sunclock -language fr -nobottomline -dock -clockgeom 63x42+2+190 -dateformat "%H:%M:%S|%a%_%d%_%b|%b%_%Y|%j%_%U/52" -command "xdiary"</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-undock </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Undocks sunclock. This option has no other effect than reallowing the use of options that were "frozen" under -dock. It can be used e.g. to exit the application when sunclock has been started in dock mode.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-synchro </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With this option, sunclock updates all windows simultaneously. This, of course, requires more CPU time and may slow down sunclock's operation if too many windows have been opened. The default is to update only the active window.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-nosynchro </strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With this option, sunclock only updates the active window. This is the default.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-clock</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Start in the clock state. This is the default and thus need not be specified.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-dateformat string1|string2|...</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the format(s) used in the text output in the bottom strip of the clock. The default date format consists of 3 strings:</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<pre>
  %H:%M%_%a%_%d%_%b%_%y|%H:%M:%S%_%Z|%a%_%j/%t%_%U/52
</pre>
<p>Here %H,%M,%S stand for hour, minutes, seconds, %a for dayname, %b for monthname, %d for monthday number, %j for yearday number, %m for month number, %y for year last two digits, %Y for year number, %t for number of days in year (365 or 366), %Z for timezone, %U for week number (week #1 is the week with the first thursday of the year); all other characters are reproduced as such, except %_ which stands for a blank space, %% which stands for % and %| which stands for |. The vertical bar | is used as a delimiter to indicate successive time formats. There can be as many formats as desired, and the actual selection cycles through all these formats by clicking on the bottom strip with the mouse. The first string (i.e. the one preceding the first bar) is taken as the default format. There are a few other switches, such as %h for hour in 12-hour mode, %P fo AM/PM indicator, %G for hour in GMT time, %N for minutes in GMT time.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-map </strong></p>

<p>where name is the ascii name of the place to be shown on the map. The first argument "size" is an nonnegative integer meant to indicate the size of the city (1: major city, 2: important city, 3: less important city, ...). The argument "size" can also be set to 0, with the effect of hiding the corresponding city, while keeping in memory all of its other parameters. The city can then be shown again with Latitude and longitude are floating point numbers representing the geographical location of the place. Western longitudes and southern latitudes should be entered as negative numbers. timezone is the name of the timezone that the place is in. This should be the name of a file under /usr/share/zoneinfo (or whatever directory is used on your system), incorrect timezones cause the clock to display GMT. It is also possible to reference a file in a directory relative to /usr/share/zoneinfo for example Canada/Eastern instead of EST5EDT.</p>

Blank characters may appear in the name if double quotes are used to mark the group of parameters (but there shouldn't be any blank characters in the other parameters). In the RC config file, blank characters should be replaced by the octal character 037 (i.e. Ctrl-Q Ctrl-_ within emacs).</p>

    <p>With this setting, major cities (category 1) will be represented by the symbol of size s1, category 2 cities by the symbol off size s2, etc. The default setting is -spotsize 1|2|3|4|5. Assigning size si=0 means that the corresponding category of cities (rank i) will not be displayed. If there are less data than the number of city categories (5 by default), the last given data is repeated as many times as needed, e.g. -spotsizes 2 is equivalent to -spotsizes 2|2|2|2|2. Example: specifying -spotsizes 0|2|0|3|0 will let appear only city categories 2 and 4, but those of category 4 will appear with the symbol normally allocated to cities of category 3. This is useful in combination with the option -sizelimits (see below).</p>

The default is 0|580|2500|6000|12000 (no constraint for major cities, rank 4 cities appear only if the width is at least 6000 pixels, e.g. if an original window of width 800, say, has been applied a zoom at least equal to 7.5). Thus -sizelimits 0 is equivalent to -sizelimits 0|0|0|0|0, -sizelimits 0|400 is equivalent to -sizelimits 0|400|400|400|400.</p>

In higher modes, the night area is displayed, with increasingly sophisticated shading algorithms. Mode 1 stands for no shading (i.e. just bright and dark colors are shown). Mode 2 shades the terminator area -- the area in which the sun is partially hidden by the horizon. Mode 3 shades the region in which there is still substantial luminosity left after sunset (depending on the diffusion parameter below). Default is 3\[ao] below horizon. Mode 4 additionally represents the luminosity values in all parts of the illuminated area. Mode 5 represents the gradient of luminosity from the brightest area (facing the sun) to the darkest area (opposite to the sun); this has nothing to do, though, with the actual luminosity values.</p>

    <p>Mode=0 stands for no objects (Sun, Moon) at all, mode=1 for objects just drawn by their symbol, mode=2 for objects drawn with their symbol and coordinates in decimal degrees (or degrees, minutes, seconds, using the \[ao] key switch).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-reformat</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option only produces an effect when a *.vmf file is loaded. The file is then reformatted according to the allowed syntax and normal line length, and printed to stdout. To capture the aoutput, one should redirect the standard output to a file (with a '&gt; file' as usual).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-vmfcolors </strong><em>color1|color2|color3...</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Redefine the list of colors to be used in the .vmf file. This option has no effect when loading files with other formats. Default is NULL string (so that the default colors are loaded). The string "|" is also considered to be a void string and can be used in the option widget to enforce default colors back.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-vmfrange </strong><em>a|b|c|d</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Define the range in which point coordinates (latitude, longitude) should vary in the *.vmf files, default is -90|90|-180|180. This option can be useful in combination with -reformat to make a linear change of coordinates in a *.vmf file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-vmcoordformat </strong><em>format</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Set the format for the output of double values produced via the -reformat option. The default format is "%7.3f %8.3f" (format for latitude and longitude, respectively), unless the -vmfrange has been modified, in which case the default becomes "%g %g" (from the POSIX rules, this stands for 6 significant digits in any position).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-vmfflags </strong><em>number</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Sets the flags (integer value) for a *.vmf file. Each bit is a distinct flag. The zeroth order bit (i.e. &1) determines whether features which have their own zeroth bit set are to be drawn in clock window mode (if the zeroth bit is not set, the feature will always be drawn). Other bits are used to control whether given features are to be drawn or not. For instance setting -vmfflags 2 with timezones.vmf will let the timezone regions appear, while -vmfflags 6 will also show the timezone boundary lines. (Only bits 0, 1, 2 are currently used in timezones.vmf).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-setcolor </strong><em>field|color</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Sets the color of a specified field in the sunclock widgets. The color can be specified as any litteral value (red, yellow, etc..., as defined in the resource file rgb.txt), or as a 6 digit hexadecimal value #ijklmn, or even 12 digits (for 48 bits displays!) The field can take any of the following values (between parentheses, the meaning and default value):</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><em>sunclock</em> calculates the position of the Sun using the algorithm in chapter 18 of:</p><p><em>Astronomical Formulae for Calculators</em> by Jean Meeus, Third Edition, Richmond: Willmann-Bell, 1985.</p><p>and projects the illuminated area onto the map image by an equidistributed (latitude, longitude) cylindrical projection.  The Sun's position is calculated to better than one arc-second in accuracy.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">BUGS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Sunclock makes intensive use of pointers and memory allocation/deallocation, so memory leaks might still be possible under some circumstances. However, the program has been thoroughly debugged, and crashes seem to be rather rare. As new features are introduced, older ones may become broken during the phase of development :-(</p><p>The illuminated area shown is the area which would be sunlit if the Earth atmosphere would be absolutely uniform.  The actual illuminated area may depend on weather, temperature, atmospheric refraction and diffusion, etc.</p>
