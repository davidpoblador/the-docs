        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Nping is an open-source tool for network packet generation, response analysis and response time measurement. Nping allows users to generate network packets of a wide range of protocols, letting them tune virtually any field of the protocol headers. While Nping can be used as a simple ping utility to detect active hosts, it can also be used as a raw packet generator for network stack stress tests, ARP poisoning, Denial of Service attacks, route tracing, and other purposes.</p><p>Additionally, Nping offers a special mode of operation called the "Echo Mode", that lets users see how the generated probes change in transit, revealing the differences between the transmitted packets and the packets received at the other end. See section "Echo Mode" for details.</p><p>The output from Nping is a list of the packets that are being sent and received. The level of detail depends on the options used.</p><p>A typical Nping execution is shown in Example&nbsp;1. The only Nping arguments used in this example are <strong>-c</strong>, to specify the number of times to target each host, <strong>--tcp</strong> to specify TCP Probe Mode, <strong>-p 80,433</strong> to specify the target ports; and then the two target hostnames.</p><p><strong>Example&nbsp;1.&nbsp;A representative Nping execution</strong></p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">TARGET SPECIFICATION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Everything on the Nping command line that isn&apos;t an option or an option argument is treated as a target host specification. Nping uses the same syntax for target specifications that Nmap does. The simplest case is a single target given by IP address or hostname.</p><p>Nping supports CIDR-style. addressing. You can append /<em>numbits</em> to an IPv4 address or hostname and Nping will send probes to every IP address for which the first <em>numbits</em> are the same as for the reference IP or hostname given. For example, 192.168.10.0/24 would send probes to the 256 hosts between 192.168.10.0 (binary: 11000000 10101000 00001010 00000000) and 192.168.10.255 (binary: 11000000 10101000 00001010 11111111), inclusive. 192.168.10.40/24 would ping exactly the same targets. Given that the host scanme.nmap.org. is at the IP address 64.13.134.52, the specification scanme.nmap.org/16 would send probes to the 65,536 IP addresses between 64.13.0.0 and 64.13.255.255. The smallest allowed value is /0, which targets the whole Internet. The largest value is /32, which targets just the named host or IP address because all address bits are fixed.</p><p>CIDR notation is short but not always flexible enough. For example, you might want to send probes to 192.168.0.0/16 but skip any IPs ending with .0 or .255 because they may be used as subnet network and broadcast addresses. Nping supports this through octet range addressing. Rather than specify a normal IP address, you can specify a comma-separated list of numbers or ranges for each octet. For example, 192.168.0-255.1-254 will skip all addresses in the range that end in .0 or .255, and 192.168.3-5,7.1 will target the four addresses 192.168.3.1, 192.168.4.1, 192.168.5.1, and 192.168.7.1. Either side of a range may be omitted; the default values are 0 on the left and 255 on the right. Using - by itself is the same as 0-255, but remember to use 0- in the first octet so the target specification doesn&apos;t look like a command-line option. Ranges need not be limited to the final octets: the specifier 0-.-.13.37 will send probes to all IP addresses on the Internet ending in .13.37.

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OPTION SPECIFICATION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Nping is designed to be very flexible and fit a wide variety of needs. As with most command-line tools, its behavior can be adjusted using command-line options. These general principles apply to option arguments, unless stated otherwise.</p><p>Options that take integer numbers can accept values specified in decimal, octal or hexadecimal base. When a number starts with 0x, it will be treated as hexadecimal; when it simply starts with 0, it will be treated as octal. Otherwise, Nping will assume the number has been specified in base 10. Virtually all numbers that can be supplied from the command line are unsigned so, as a general rule, the minimum value is zero. Users may also specify the word random or rand to make Nping generate a random value within the expected range.</p><p>IP addresses may be given as IPv4 addresses (e.g. 192.168.1.1), IPv6 addresses (e.g. 2001:db8:85a3::8e4c:760:7146), or hostnames, which will be resolved using the default DNS server configured in the host system.</p><p>Options that take MAC addresses accept the usual colon-separated 6 hex byte format (e.g. 00:50:56:d4:01:98). Hyphens may also be used instead of colons (e.g. 00-50-56-c0-00-08). The special word random or rand sets a random address and the word broadcast or bcast sets ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">GENERAL OPERATION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Unlike other ping and packet generation tools, Nping supports multiple target host and port specifications. While this provides great flexibility, it is not obvious how Nping handles situations where there is more than one host and/or more than one port to send probes to. This section explains how Nping behaves in these cases.</p><p>When multiple target hosts are specified, Nping rotates among them in round-robin fashion. This gives slow hosts more time to send their responses before another probe is sent to them. Ports are also scheduled using round robin. So, unless only one port is specified, Nping never sends two probes to the same target host and port consecutively.</p><p>The loop around targets is the &ldquo;inner loop&rdquo; and the loop around ports is the &ldquo;outer loop&rdquo;. All targets will be sent a probe for a given port before moving on to the next port. Between probes, Nping waits a configurable amount of time called the &ldquo;inter-probe delay&rdquo;, which is controlled by the <strong>--delay</strong> option. These examples show how it works.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">PROBE MODES</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Nping supports a wide variety of protocols. Although in some cases Nping can automatically determine the mode from the options used, it is generally a good idea to specify it explicitly.</p><p><strong>--tcp-connect</strong> (TCP Connect mode) .</p><p>TCP connect mode is the default mode when a user does not have raw packet privileges. Instead of writing raw packets as most other modes do, Nping asks the underlying operating system to establish a connection with the target machine and port by issuing the connect system call. This is the same high-level system call that web browsers, P2P clients, and most other network-enabled applications use to establish a connection. It is part of a programming interface known as the Berkeley Sockets API. Rather than read raw packet responses off the wire, Nping uses this API to obtain status information on each connection attempt. For this reason, you will not be able to see the contents of the packets that are sent or received but only status information about the TCP connection establishment taking place.</p><p><strong>--tcp</strong> (TCP mode) .</p><p>TCP is the mode that lets users create and send any kind of TCP packet. TCP packets are sent embedded in IP packets that can also be tuned. This mode can be used for many different purposes. For example you could try to discover open ports by sending TCP SYN messages without completing the three-way handshake. This technique is often referred to as half-open scanning, because you don&apos;t open a full TCP connection. You send a SYN packet, as if you are going to open a real connection and then wait for a response. A SYN/ACK indicates the port is open, while a RST indicates it&apos;s closed. If no response is received one could assume that some intermediate network device is filtering the responses. Another use could be to see how a remote TCP/IP stack behaves when it receives a non-RFC-compliant packet, like one with both SYN and RST flags set. One could also do some evil by creating custom RST packets using an spoofed IP address with the intent of closing an active TCP connection.</p><p><strong>--udp</strong> (UDP mode) .</p><p>UDP mode can have two different behaviours. Under normal circumstances, it lets users create custom IP/UDP packets. However, if Nping is run by a user without raw packet privileges and no changes to the default protocol headers are requested, then Nping enters the unprivileged UDP mode which basically sends UDP packets to the specified target hosts and ports using the sendto system call. Note that in this unprivileged mode it is not possible to see low-level header information of the packets on the wire but only status information about the amount of bytes that are being transmitted and received. UDP mode can be used to interact with any UDP-based server. Examples are DNS servers, streaming servers, online gaming servers, and port knocking/single-packet. authorization daemons.</p><p><strong>--icmp</strong> (ICMP mode) .</p><p>ICMP mode is the default mode when the user runs Nping with raw packet privileges. Any kind of ICMP message can be created. The default ICMP type is Echo, i.e., ping. ICMP mode can be used for many different purposes, from a simple request for a timestamp or a netmask to the transmission of fake destination unreachable messages, custom redirects, and router advertisements.</p><p><strong>--arp</strong> (ARP/RARP mode) .</p><p>ARP lets you create and send a few different ARP-related packets. These include ARP, RARP, DRARP, and InARP requests and replies. This mode can ban be used to perform low-level host discovery, and conduct ARP-cache poisoning attacks.</p><p><strong>--traceroute</strong> (Traceroute mode) .</p><p>Traceroute is not a mode by itself but a complement to TCP, UDP, and ICMP modes. When this option is specified Nping will set the IP TTL value of the first probe to 1. When the next router receives the packet it will drop it due to the expiration of the TTL and it will generate an ICMP destination unreachable message. The next probe will have a TTL of 2 so now the first router will forward the packet while the second router will be the one that drops the packet and generates the ICMP message. The third probe will have a TTL value of 3 and so on. By examining the source addresses of all those ICMP Destination Unreachable messages it is possible to determine the path that the probes take until they reach their final destination.</p>

The special value ALL means to set all flags. NONE means to set no flags. It is important that if you don&apos;t want any flag to be set, you request it explicitly because in some cases the SYN flag may be set by default. Here is a brief description of the meaning of each flag:</p><p>CWR (Congestion Window Reduced) .</p><p>Set by an ECN-Capable sender when it reduces its congestion window (due to a retransmit timeout, a fast retransmit or in response to an ECN notification.</p><p>ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) .</p><p>During the three-way handshake it indicates that sender is capable of performing explicit congestion notification.

<p><strong>-S </strong><strong></strong><em>addr</em>, <strong>--source-ip </strong><strong></strong><em>addr</em> (Source IP Address) .</p><p>Sets the source IP address. This option lets you specify a custom IP address to be used as source IP address in sent packets. This allows spoofing the sender of the packets. <em>addr</em> can be an IPv4 address or a hostname.</p><p><strong>--dest-ip </strong><strong></strong><em>addr</em> (Destination IP Address) .</p><p>Adds a target to Nping&apos;s target list. This option is provided for consistency but its use is deprecated in favor of plain target specifications. See the section called &ldquo;TARGET SPECIFICATION&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>--tos </strong><strong></strong><em>tos</em> (Type of Service) .</p><p>Sets the IP TOS field. The TOS field is used to carry information to provide quality of service features. It is normally used to support a technique called Differentiated Services. See RFC 2474. for more information. <em>tos</em> must be a number in the range [0&ndash;255].</p><p><strong>--id </strong><strong></strong><em>id</em> (Identification) .</p><p>Sets the IPv4 Identification field. The Identification field is a 16-bit value that is common to all fragments belonging to a particular message. The value is used by the receiver to reassemble the original message from the fragments received. <em>id</em> must be a number in the range [0&ndash;65535].</p><p><strong>--df</strong> (Don&apos;t Fragment) .</p><p>Sets the Don&apos;t Fragment bit in sent packets. When an IP datagram has its DF flag set, intermediate devices are not allowed to fragment it so if it needs to travel across a network with a MTU smaller that datagram length the datagram will have to be dropped. Normally an ICMP Destination Unreachable message is generated and sent back to the sender.</p><p><strong>--mf</strong> (More Fragments) .</p><p>Sets the More Fragments bit in sent packets. The MF flag is set to indicate the receiver that the current datagram is a fragment of some larger datagram. When set to zero it indicates that the current datagram is either the last fragment in the set or that it is the only fragment.</p><p><strong>--ttl </strong><strong></strong><em>hops</em> (Time To Live) .</p><p>Sets the IPv4 Time-To-Live (TTL) field in sent packets to the given value. The TTL field specifies how long the datagram is allowed to exist on the network. It was originally intended to represent a number of seconds but it actually represents the number of hops a packet can traverse before being dropped. The TTL tries to avoid a situation in which undeliverable datagrams keep being forwarded from one router to another endlessly. <em>hops</em> must be a number in the range [0&ndash;255].</p><p><strong>--badsum-ip</strong> (Invalid IP checksum) .</p><p>Asks Nping to use an invalid IP checksum for packets sent to target hosts. Note that some systems (like most Linux kernels), may fix the checksum before placing the packet on the wire, so even if Nping shows the incorrect checksum in its output, the packets may be transparently corrected by the kernel.</p><p><strong>--ip-options </strong><strong></strong><em>S|R [route]|L [route]|T|U ...</em>, <strong>--ip-options </strong><strong></strong><em>hex string</em> (IP Options) .</p><p>The IP protocol offers several options which may be placed in packet headers. Unlike the ubiquitous TCP options, IP options are rarely seen due to practicality and security concerns. In fact, many Internet routers block the most dangerous options such as source routing. Yet options can still be useful in some cases for determining and manipulating the network route to target machines. For example, you may be able to use the record route option to determine a path to a target even when more traditional traceroute-style approaches fail. Or if your packets are being dropped by a certain firewall, you may be able to specify a different route with the strict or loose source routing options.</p><p>The most powerful way to specify IP options is to simply pass in hexadecimal data as the argument to <strong>--ip-options</strong>. Precede each hex byte value with &#92;x. You may repeat certain characters by following them with an asterisk and then the number of times you wish them to repeat. For example, &#92;x01&#92;x07&#92;x04&#92;x00*4 is the same as &#92;x01&#92;x07&#92;x04&#92;x00&#92;x00&#92;x00&#92;x00.</p><p>Note that if you specify a number of bytes that is not a multiple of four, an incorrect IP header length will be set in the IP packet. The reason for this is that the IP header length field can only express multiples of four. In those cases, the length is computed by dividing the header length by 4 and rounding down. This will affect the way the header that follows the IP header is interpreted, showing bogus information in Nping or in the output of any sniffer. Although this kind of situation might be useful for some stack stress tests, users would normally want to specify explicit padding, so the correct header length is set.</p><p>Nping also offers a shortcut mechanism for specifying options. Simply pass the letter R, T, or U to request record-route, record-timestamp, or both options together, respectively. Loose or strict source routing may be specified with an L or S followed by a space and then a space-separated list of IP addresses.</p><p>For more information and examples of using IP options with Nping, see the mailing list post at \m[blue]<strong>http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2006/q3/0052.html</strong>\m[].</p><p><strong>--mtu </strong><strong></strong><em>size</em> (Maximum Transmission Unit) .</p><p>This option sets a fictional MTU in Nping so IP datagrams larger than <em>size</em> are fragmented before transmission. <em>size</em> must be specified in bytes and corresponds to the number of octets that can be carried on a single link-layer frame.</p>

<p><strong>-6</strong>, <strong>--ipv6</strong> (Use IPv6) .</p><p>Tells Nping to use IP version 6 instead of the default IPv4. It is generally a good idea to specify this option as early as possible in the command line so Nping can parse it soon and know in advance that the rest of the parameters refer to IPv6. The command syntax is the same as usual except that you also add the <strong>-6</strong> option. Of course, you must use IPv6 syntax if you specify an address rather than a hostname. An address might look like <strong>3ffe:7501:4819:2000:210:f3ff:fe03:14d0</strong>, so hostnames are recommended.</p><p>While IPv6 hasn&apos;t exactly taken the world by storm, it gets significant use in some (usually Asian) countries and most modern operating systems support it. To use Nping with IPv6, both the source and target of your packets must be configured for IPv6. If your ISP (like most of them) does not allocate IPv6 addresses to you, free tunnel brokers are widely available and work fine with Nping. You can use the free IPv6 tunnel broker service at \m[blue]<strong>http://www.tunnelbroker.net</strong>\m[].</p><p>Please note that IPv6 support is still highly experimental and many modes and options may not work with it.</p><p><strong>-S </strong><strong></strong><em>addr</em>, <strong>--source-ip </strong><strong></strong><em>addr</em> (Source IP Address) .</p><p>Sets the source IP address. This option lets you specify a custom IP address to be used as source IP address in sent packets. This allows spoofing the sender of the packets. <em>addr</em> can be an IPv6 address or a hostname.</p><p><strong>--dest-ip </strong><strong></strong><em>addr</em> (Destination IP Address) .</p><p>Adds a target to Nping&apos;s target list. This option is provided for consistency but its use is deprecated in favor of plain target specifications. See the section called &ldquo;TARGET SPECIFICATION&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>--flow </strong><strong></strong><em>label</em> (Flow Label) .</p><p>Sets the IPv6 Flow Label. The Flow Label field is 20 bits long and is intended to provide certain quality-of-service properties for real-time datagram delivery. However, it has not been widely adopted, and not all routers or endpoints support it. Check RFC 2460. for more information. <em>label</em> must be an integer in the range [0&ndash;1048575].</p><p><strong>--traffic-class </strong><strong></strong><em>class</em> (Traffic Class) .</p><p>Sets the IPv6 Traffic Class. This field is similar to the TOS field in IPv4, and is intended to provide the Differentiated Services method, enabling scalable service discrimination in the Internet without the need for per-flow state and signaling at every hop. Check RFC 2474. for more information. <em>class</em> must be an integer in the range [0&ndash;255].</p><p><strong>--hop-limit </strong><strong></strong><em>hops</em> (Hop Limit) .</p><p>Sets the IPv6 Hop Limit field in sent packets to the given value. The Hop Limit field specifies how long the datagram is allowed to exist on the network. It represents the number of hops a packet can traverse before being dropped. As with the TTL in IPv4, IPv6 Hop Limit tries to avoid a situation in which undeliverable datagrams keep being forwarded from one router to another endlessly. <em>hops</em> must be a number in the range [0&ndash;255].</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">ECHO MODE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The "Echo Mode" is a novel technique implemented by Nping which lets users see how network packets change in transit, from the host where they originated to the target machine. Basically, the Echo mode turns Nping into two different pieces: the Echo server and the Echo client. The Echo server is a network service that has the ability to capture packets from the network and send a copy ("echo them") to the originating client through a side TCP channel. The Echo client is the part that generates such network packets, transmits them to the server, and receives their echoed version through a side TCP channel that it has previously established with the Echo server.</p><p>This scheme lets the client see the differences between the packets that it sends and what is actually received by the server. By having the server send back copies of the received packets through the side channel, things like NAT devices become immediately apparent to the client because it notices the changes in the source IP address (and maybe even source port). Other devices like those that perform traffic shaping, changing TCP window sizes or adding TCP options transparently between hosts, turn up too.</p><p>The Echo mode is also useful for troubleshooting routing and firewall issues. Among other things, it can be used to determine if the traffic generated by the Nping client is being dropped in transit and never gets to its destination or if the responses are the ones that don&apos;t get back to it.</p><p>Internally, client and server communicate over an encrypted and authenticated channel, using the Nping Echo Protocol (NEP), whose technical specification can be found in \m[blue]<strong>http://nmap.org/svn/nping/docs/EchoProtoRFC.txt</strong>\m[]</p><p>The following paragraphs describe the different options available in Nping&apos;s Echo mode.</p><p><strong>--ec </strong><strong></strong><em>passphrase</em>, <strong>--echo-client </strong><strong></strong><em>passphrase</em> (Run Echo client) .</p><p>This option tells Nping to run as an Echo client. <em>passphrase</em> is a sequence of ASCII characters that is used used to generate the cryptographic keys needed for encryption and authentication in a given session. The passphrase should be a secret that is also known by the server, and it may contain any number of printable ASCII characters. Passphrases that contain whitespace or special characters must be enclosed in double quotes.</p><p>When running Nping as an Echo client, most options from the regular raw probe modes apply. The client may be configured to send specific probes using flags like <strong>--tcp</strong>, <strong>--icmp</strong> or <strong>--udp</strong>. Protocol header fields may be manipulated normally using the appropriate options (e.g. <strong>--ttl</strong>, <strong>--seq</strong>, <strong>--icmp-type</strong>, etc.). The only exceptions are ARP-related flags, which are not supported in Echo mode, as protocols like ARP are closely related to the data link layer and its probes can&apos;t pass through different network segments.</p><p><strong>--es </strong><strong></strong><em>passphrase</em>, <strong>--echo-server </strong><strong></strong><em>passphrase</em> (Run Echo server) .</p><p>This option tells Nping to run as an Echo server. <em>passphrase</em> is a sequence of ASCII characters that is used used to generate the cryptographic keys needed for encryption and authentication in a given session. The passphrase should be a secret that is also known by the clients, and it may contain any number of printable ASCII characters. Passphrases that contain whitespace or special characters must be enclosed in double quotes. Note that although it is not recommended, it is possible to use empty passphrases, supplying <strong>--echo-server ""</strong>. However, if what you want is to set up an open Echo server, it is better to use option <strong>--no-crypto</strong>. See below for details.</p><p><strong>--ep </strong><strong></strong><em>port</em>, <strong>--echo-port </strong><strong></strong><em>port</em> (Set Echo TCP port number) .</p><p>This option asks Nping to use the specified TCP port number for the Echo side channel connection. If this option is used with <strong>--echo-server</strong>, it specifies the port on which the server listens for connections. If it is used with <strong>--echo-client</strong>, it specifies the port to connect to on the remote host. By default, port number 9929 is used.</p><p><strong>--nc</strong>, <strong>--no-crypto</strong> (Disable encryption and authentication) .</p><p>This option asks Nping not to use any cryptographic operations during an Echo session. In practical terms, this means that the Echo side channel session data will be transmitted in the clear, and no authentication will be performed by the server or client during the session establishment phase. When <strong>--no-crypto</strong> is used, the passphrase supplied with <strong>--echo-server</strong> or <strong>--echo-client</strong> is ignored.</p><p>This option must be specified if Nping was compiled without openSSL support. Note that, for technical reasons, a passphrase still needs to be supplied after the --echo-client or --echo-server flags, even though it will be ignored.</p><p>The --no-crypto flag might be useful when setting up a public Echo server, because it allows users to connect to the Echo server without the need for any passphrase or shared secret. However, it is strongly recommended to not use --no-crypto unless absolutely necessary. Public Echo servers should be configured to use the passphrase "public" or the empty passphrase (--echo-server "") as the use of cryptography does not only provide confidentiality and authentication but also message integrity.</p><p><strong>--once</strong> (Serve one client and quit) .</p><p>This option asks the Echo server to quit after serving one client. This is useful when only a single Echo session wants to be established as it eliminates the need to access the remote host to shutdown the server.</p><p><strong>--safe-payloads</strong> (Zero application data before echoing a packet) .</p><p>This option asks the Echo server to erase any application layer data found in client packets before echoing them. When the option is enabled, the Echo server parses the packets received from Echo clients and tries to determine if they contain data beyond the transport layer. If such data is found, it is overwritten with zeroes before transmitting the packets to the appropriate Echo client.</p><p>Echo servers can handle multiple simultaneous clients running multiple echo sessions in parallel. In order to determine which packet needs to be echoed to which client and through which session, the Echo server uses an heuristic algorithm. Although we have taken every security measure that we could think of to prevent that a client receives an echoed packet that it did not generate, there is always a risk that our algorithm makes a mistake and delivers a packet to the wrong client. The --safe-payloads option is useful for public echo servers or critical deployments where that kind of mistake cannot be afforded.</p><p>The following examples illustrate how Nping&apos;s Echo mode can be used to discover intermediate devices.</p><p><strong>Example&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Discovering NAT devices</strong></p>

<p>The output clearly shows the presence of a NAT device in the client&apos;s local network. Note how the captured packet (CAPT) differs from the SENT packet: the source address for the original packets is in the reserved 10.0.0.0/8 range, while the address seen by the server is 80.38.10.21, the Internet side address of the NAT device. The source port was also modified by the device. The line starting with RCVD corresponds to the responses generated by the TCP/IP stack of the machine where the Echo server is run.</p><p><strong>Example&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Discovering a transparent proxy</strong></p>

<p>In this example, the output is a bit more tricky. The absence of error messages shows that the Echo client has successfully established an Echo session with the server. However, no CAPT packets can be seen in the output. This means that none of the transmitted packets reached the server. Interestingly, a TCP SYN-ACK packet was received in response to the first TCP-SYN packet (and also, it is known that the target host does not have port 80 open). This behavior reveals the presence of a transparent web proxy cache server (which in this case is an old MS ISA server).</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>--delay </strong><strong></strong><em>time</em> (Delay between probes) .</p><p>This option lets you control for how long will Nping wait before sending the next probe. Like in many other ping tools, the default delay is one second. <em>time</em> must be a positive integer or floating point number. By default it is specified in seconds, however you can give an explicit unit by appending ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, or h for hours (e.g. 2.5s, 45m, 2h).</p><p><strong>--rate </strong><strong></strong><em>rate</em> (Send probes at a given rate) .</p><p>This option specifies the number of probes that Nping should send per second. This option and <strong>--delay</strong> are inverses; <strong>--rate 20</strong> is the same as <strong>--delay 0.05</strong>. If both options are used, only the last one in the parameter list counts.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong> (Display help) .</p><p>Displays help information and exits.</p><p><strong>-V</strong>, <strong>--version</strong> (Display version) .</p><p>Displays the program&apos;s version number and quits.</p><p><strong>-c </strong><strong></strong><em>rounds</em>, <strong>--count </strong><strong></strong><em>rounds</em> (Stop after a given number of rounds) .</p><p>This option lets you specify the number of times that Nping should loop over target hosts (and in some cases target ports). Nping calls these &ldquo;rounds&rdquo;. In a basic execution with only one target (and only one target port in TCP/UDP modes), the number of rounds matches the number of probes sent to the target host. However, in more complex executions where Nping is run against multiple targets and multiple ports, the number of rounds is the number of times that Nping sends a complete set of probes that covers all target IPs and all target ports. For example, if Nping is asked to send TCP SYN packets to hosts 192.168.1.0-255 and ports 80 and 433, then 256 \(mu 2&nbsp;=&nbsp;512 packets are sent in one round. So if you specify <strong>-c 100</strong>, Nping will loop over the different target hosts and ports 100 times, sending a total of 256 \(mu 2 \(mu 100&nbsp;=&nbsp;51200 packets. By default Nping runs for 5 rounds. If a value of 0 is specified, Nping will run continuously.</p><p><strong>-e </strong><strong></strong><em>name</em>, <strong>--interface </strong><strong></strong><em>name</em> (Set the network interface to be used) .</p><p>This option tells Nping what interface should be used to send and receive packets. Nping should be able to detect this automatically, but it will tell you if it cannot. <em>name</em> must be the name of an existing network interface with an assigned IP address.</p><p><strong>--privileged</strong> (Assume that the user is fully privileged) .</p><p>Tells Nping to simply assume that it is privileged enough to perform raw socket sends, packet sniffing, and similar operations that usually require special privileges. By default Nping quits if such operations are requested by a user that has no root or administrator privileges. This option may be useful on Linux, BSD or similar systems that can be configured to allow unprivileged users to perform raw-packet transmissions. The <strong>NPING_PRIVILEGED</strong>. environment variable may be set as an alternative to using <strong>--privileged</strong>.</p><p><strong>--unprivileged</strong> (Assume that the user lacks raw socket privileges) .</p><p>This option is the opposite of <strong>--privileged</strong>. It tells Nping to treat the user as lacking network raw socket and sniffing privileges. This is useful for testing, debugging, or when the raw network functionality of your operating system is somehow broken. The <strong>NPING_UNPRIVILEGED</strong>. environment variable may be set as an alternative to using <strong>--unprivileged</strong>.</p><p><strong>--send-eth</strong> (Use raw ethernet sending) .</p><p>Asks Nping to send packets at the raw ethernet (data link) layer rather than the higher IP (network) layer. By default, Nping chooses the one which is generally best for the platform it is running on. Raw sockets (IP layer) are generally most efficient for Unix machines, while ethernet frames are required for Windows operation since Microsoft disabled raw socket support. Nping still uses raw IP packets despite this option when there is no other choice (such as non-ethernet connections).</p><p><strong>--send-ip</strong> (Send at raw IP level) .</p><p>Asks Nping to send packets via raw IP sockets rather than sending lower level ethernet frames. It is the complement to the <strong>--send-eth</strong> option.</p><p><strong>--bpf-filter </strong><strong></strong><em>filter spec</em> <strong>--filter </strong><strong></strong><em>filter spec</em> (Set custom BPF filter) .</p><p>This option lets you use a custom BPF filter. By default Nping chooses a filter that is intended to capture most common responses to the particular probes that are sent. For example, when sending TCP packets, the filter is set to capture packets whose destination port matches the probe&apos;s source port or ICMP error messages that may be generated by the target or any intermediate device as a result of the probe. If for some reason you expect strange packets in response to sent probes or you just want to sniff a particular kind of traffic, you can specify a custom filter using the BPF syntax used by tools like tcpdump.. See the documentation at \m[blue]<strong>http://www.tcpdump.org/</strong>\m[] for more information.</p><p><strong>-H</strong>, <strong>--hide-sent</strong> (Do not display sent packets) .</p><p>This option tells Nping not to print information about sent packets. This can be useful when using very short inter-probe delays (i.e., when flooding), because printing information to the standard output has a computational cost and disabling it can probably speed things up a bit. Also, it may be useful when using Nping to detect active hosts or open ports (e.g. sending probes to all TCP ports in a /24 subnet). In that case, users may not want to see thousands of sent probes but just the replies generated by active hosts.</p><p><strong>-N</strong>, <strong>--no-capture</strong> (Do not attempt to capture replies) .</p><p>This option tells Nping to skip packet capture. This means that packets in response to sent probes will not be processed or displayed. This can be useful when doing flooding and network stack stress tests. Note that when this option is specified, most of the statistics shown at the end of the execution will be useless. This option does not work with TCP Connect mode.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OUTPUT OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>-v</strong><strong>[</strong><em>level</em>], <strong>--verbose </strong><strong>[</strong><em>level</em>] (Increase or set verbosity level) .</p><p>Increases the verbosity level, causing Nping to print more information during its execution. There are 9 levels of verbosity (-4 to 4). Every instance of <strong>-v</strong> increments the verbosity level by one (from its default value, level 0). Every instance of option <strong>-q</strong> decrements the verbosity level by one. Alternatively you can specify the level directly, as in <strong>-v3</strong> or <strong>-v-1</strong>. These are the available levels:</p><p>Level −4</p><p>No output at all. In some circumstances you may not want Nping to produce any output (like when one of your work mates is watching over your shoulder). In that case level −4 can be useful because although you won&apos;t see any response packets, probes will still be sent.</p><p>Level −3</p><p>Like level −4 but displays fatal error messages so you can actually see if Nping is running or it failed due to some error.</p><p>Level −2</p><p>Like level −3 but also displays warnings and recoverable errors.</p><p>Level −1</p><p>Displays traditional run-time information (version, start time, statistics, etc.) but does not display sent or received packets.</p><p>Level 0</p><p>This is the default verbosity level. It behaves like level −1 but also displays sent and received packets and some other important information.</p><p>Level 1</p><p>Like level 0 but it displays detailed information about timing, flags, protocol details, etc.</p><p>Level 2</p><p>Like level 1 but displays very detailed information about sent and received packets and other interesting information.</p><p>Level 3</p><p>Like level 2 but also displays the raw hexadecimal dump of sent and received packets.</p><p>Level 4 and higher</p><p>Same as level 3.</p><p><strong>-q</strong><strong>[</strong><em>level</em>], <strong>--reduce-verbosity </strong><strong>[</strong><em>level</em>] (Decrease verbosity level) .</p><p>Decreases the verbosity level, causing Nping to print less information during its execution.</p><p><strong>-d</strong><strong>[</strong><em>level</em>] (Increase or set debugging level) .</p><p>When even verbose mode doesn&apos;t provide sufficient data for you, debugging is available to flood you with much more! As with the <strong>-v</strong>, debugging is enabled with a command-line flag <strong>-d</strong> and the debug level can be increased by specifying it multiple times. There are 7 debugging levels (0 to 6). Every instance of <strong>-d</strong> increments debugging level by one. Provide an argument to <strong>-d</strong> to set the level directly; for example <strong>-d4</strong>.</p><p>Debugging output is useful when you suspect a bug in Nping, or if you are simply confused as to what Nping is doing and why. As this feature is mostly intended for developers, debug lines aren&apos;t always self-explanatory. You may get something like</p>
<pre>
NSOCK (1.0000s) Callback: TIMER SUCCESS for EID 12; tcpconnect_event_handler(): Received callback of type TIMER with status SUCCESS
</pre>
<p>If you don&apos;t understand a line, your only recourses are to ignore it, look it up in the source code, or request help from the development list (nmap-dev). Some lines are self-explanatory, but the messages become more obscure as the debug level is increased. These are the available levels:</p><p>Level 0</p><p>Level 0. No debug information at all. This is the default level.</p><p>Level 1</p><p>In this level, only very important or high-level debug information will be printed.</p><p>Level 2</p><p>Like level 1 but also displays important or medium-level debug information</p><p>Level 3</p><p>Like level 2 but also displays regular and low-level debug information.</p><p>Level 4</p><p>Like level 3 but also displays messages only a real Nping freak would want to see.</p><p>Level 5</p><p>Like level 4 but it enables basic debug information related to external libraries like Nsock..</p><p>Level 6</p><p>Like level 5 but it enables full, very detailed, debug information related to external libraries like Nsock.</p>

<p>Like its author, Nping isn&apos;t perfect. But you can help make it better by sending bug reports or even writing patches. If Nping doesn&apos;t behave the way you expect, first upgrade to the latest Nmap version available from \m[blue]<strong>http://nmap.org/download.html</strong>\m[]. If the problem persists, do some research to determine whether it has already been discovered and addressed. Try searching for the error message on our search page at \m[blue]<strong>http://insecure.org/search.html</strong>\m[] or at Google. Also try browsing the nmap-dev archives at \m[blue]<strong>http://seclists.org/</strong>\m[]. Read this full manual page as well. If nothing comes out of this, mail a bug report to dev@nmap.org. Please include everything you have learned about the problem, as well as what version of Nping you are running and what operating system version it is running on. Problem reports and Nping usage questions sent to dev@nmap.org are far more likely to be answered than those sent to Fyodor directly. If you subscribe to the nmap-dev list before posting, your message will bypass moderation and get through more quickly.
