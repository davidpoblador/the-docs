        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>If the <strong>ZLE</strong> option is set (which it is by default in interactive shells) and the shell input is attached to the terminal, the user is able to edit command lines.</p><p>There are two display modes.  The first, multiline mode, is the default.  It only works if the <strong>TERM</strong> parameter is set to a valid terminal type that can move the cursor up.  The second, single line mode, is used if <strong>TERM</strong> is invalid or incapable of moving the cursor up, or if the <strong>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</strong> option is set. This mode is similar to <strong>ksh</strong>, and uses no termcap sequences.  If <strong>TERM</strong> is "emacs", the <strong>ZLE</strong> option will be unset by default.</p><p>The parameters <strong>BAUD</strong>, <strong>COLUMNS</strong>, and <strong>LINES</strong> are also used by the line editor. See <em>Parameters Used By The Shell</em> in <a href="../man1/zshparam.1.html"><strong>zshparam</strong>(1)</a>.</p><p>The parameter <strong>zle_highlight</strong> is also used by the line editor; see <em>Character Highlighting</em> below.  Highlighting of special characters and the region between the cursor and the mark (as set with <strong>set-mark-command</strong> in Emacs mode) is enabled by default; consult this reference for more information.  Irascible conservatives will wish to know that all highlighting may be disabled by the following setting:</p>

<strong>zle_highlight=(none)</strong>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">KEYMAPS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>A keymap in ZLE contains a set of bindings between key sequences and ZLE commands.  The empty key sequence cannot be bound.</p><p>There can be any number of keymaps at any time, and each keymap has one or more names.  If all of a keymap's names are deleted, it disappears. <strong>bindkey</strong> can be used to manipulate keymap names.</p><p>Initially, there are six keymaps:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>emacs</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>EMACS emulation</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>viins</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>vi emulation - insert mode</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>vicmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>vi emulation - command mode</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>isearch</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>incremental search mode</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>command</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>read a command name</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>.safe</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>fallback keymap</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The `<strong>.safe</strong>' keymap is special.  It can never be altered, and the name can never be removed.  However, it can be linked to other names, which can be removed.  In the future other special keymaps may be added; users should avoid using names beginning with `<strong>.</strong>' for their own keymaps.</p><p>In addition to these names, either `<strong>emacs</strong>' or `<strong>viins</strong>' is also linked to the name `<strong>main</strong>'.  If one of the <strong>VISUAL</strong> or <strong>EDITOR</strong> environment variables contain the string `<strong>vi</strong>' when the shell starts up then it will be `<strong>viins</strong>', otherwise it will be `<strong>emacs</strong>'. <strong>bindkey</strong>'s <strong>-e</strong> and <strong>-v</strong> options provide a convenient way to override this default choice.</p><p>When the editor starts up, it will select the `<strong>main</strong>' keymap. If that keymap doesn't exist, it will use `<strong>.safe</strong>' instead.</p><p>In the `<strong>.safe</strong>' keymap, each single key is bound to <strong>self-insert</strong>, except for ^J (line feed) and ^M (return) which are bound to <strong>accept-line</strong>. This is deliberately not pleasant to use; if you are using it, it means you deleted the main keymap, and you should put it back.</p><h3>Reading Commands</h3>
<p>When ZLE is reading a command from the terminal, it may read a sequence that is bound to some command and is also a prefix of a longer bound string. In this case ZLE will wait a certain time to see if more characters are typed, and if not (or they don't match any longer string) it will execute the binding.  This timeout is defined by the <strong>KEYTIMEOUT</strong> parameter; its default is 0.4 sec.  There is no timeout if the prefix string is not itself bound to a command.</p><p>The key timeout is also applied when ZLE is reading the bytes from a multibyte character string when it is in the appropriate mode.  (This requires that the shell was compiled with multibyte mode enabled; typically also the locale has characters with the UTF-8 encoding, although any multibyte encoding known to the operating system is supported.)  If the second or a subsequent byte is not read within the timeout period, the shell acts as if <strong>?</strong> were typed and resets the input state.</p><p>As well as ZLE commands, key sequences can be bound to other strings, by using `<strong>bindkey -s</strong>'. When such a sequence is read, the replacement string is pushed back as input, and the command reading process starts again using these fake keystrokes. This input can itself invoke further replacement strings, but in order to detect loops the process will be stopped if there are twenty such replacements without a real command being read.</p><p>A key sequence typed by the user can be turned into a command name for use in user-defined widgets with the <strong>read-command</strong> widget, described below.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">ZLE BUILTINS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The ZLE module contains three related builtin commands. The <strong>bindkey</strong> command manipulates keymaps and key bindings; the <strong>vared</strong> command invokes ZLE on the value of a shell parameter; and the <strong>zle</strong> command manipulates editing widgets and allows command line access to ZLE commands from within shell functions.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>bindkey</strong> [ <em>options</em> ] [ <em>in-string</em> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>bindkey</strong>'s options can be divided into three categories: keymap selection for the current command, operation selection, and others.  The keymap selection options are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-e</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Selects keymap `<strong>emacs</strong>' for any operations by the current command, and also links `<strong>emacs</strong>' to `<strong>main</strong>' so that it is selected by default the next time the editor starts.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-v</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Selects keymap `<strong>viins</strong>' for any operations by the current command, and also links `<strong>viins</strong>' to `<strong>main</strong>' so that it is selected by default the next time the editor starts.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-a</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Selects keymap `<strong>vicmd</strong>' for any operations by the current command.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-M</strong> <em>keymap</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <em>keymap</em> specifies a keymap name that is selected for any operations by the current command.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>If a keymap selection is required and none of the options above are used, the `<strong>main</strong>' keymap is used.  Some operations do not permit a keymap to be selected, namely:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-l</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>List all existing keymap names; if any arguments are given, list just those keymaps.</p><p>If the <strong>-L</strong> option is also used, list in the form of <strong>bindkey</strong> commands to create or link the keymaps.  `<strong>bindkey -lL</strong> main' shows which keymap is linked to `<strong>main</strong>', if any, and hence if the standard emacs or vi emulation is in effect.  This option does not show the <strong>.safe</strong> keymap because it cannot be created in that fashion; however, neither is `<strong>bindkey -lL .safe</strong>' reported as an error, it simply outputs nothing.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-d</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Delete all existing keymaps and reset to the default state.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-D</strong> <em>keymap</em> ...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Delete the named <em>keymap</em>s.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-A</strong> <em>old-keymap new-keymap</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Make the <em>new-keymap</em> name an alias for <em>old-keymap</em>, so that both names refer to the same keymap.  The names have equal standing; if either is deleted, the other remains.  If there is already a keymap with the <em>new-keymap</em> name, it is deleted.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-N</strong> <em>new-keymap</em> [ <em>old-keymap</em> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Create a new keymap, named <em>new-keymap</em>.  If a keymap already has that name, it is deleted.  If an <em>old-keymap</em> name is given, the new keymap is initialized to be a duplicate of it, otherwise the new keymap will be empty.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>To use a newly created keymap, it should be linked to <strong>main</strong>.  Hence the sequence of commands to create and use a new keymap `<strong>mymap</strong>' initialized from the <strong>emacs</strong> keymap (which remains unchanged) is:</p>
<pre>
<strong>bindkey -N mymap emacs</strong>
bindkey -A mymap main
</pre>
<p>Note that while `<strong>bindkey -A</strong> <em>newmap</em> <strong>main</strong>' will work when <em>newmap</em> is <strong>emacs</strong> or <strong>viins</strong>, it will not work for <strong>vicmd</strong>, as switching from vi insert to command mode becomes impossible.</p><p>The following operations act on the `<strong>main</strong>' keymap if no keymap selection option was given:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-m</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Add the built-in set of meta-key bindings to the selected keymap. Only keys that are unbound or bound to <strong>self-insert</strong> are affected.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-r</strong> <em>in-string</em> ...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Unbind the specified <em>in-string</em>s in the selected keymap. This is exactly equivalent to binding the strings to <strong>undefined-key</strong>.</p><p>When <strong>-R</strong> is also used, interpret the <em>in-string</em>s as ranges.</p><p>When <strong>-p</strong> is also used, the <em>in-string</em>s specify prefixes.  Any binding that has the given <em>in-string</em> as a prefix, not including the binding for the <em>in-string</em> itself, if any, will be removed.  For example,</p>
<pre>
<strong>bindkey -rpM viins '^['</strong>
</pre>
<p>will remove all bindings in the vi-insert keymap beginning with an escape character (probably cursor keys), but leave the binding for the escape character itself (probably <strong>vi-cmd-mode</strong>).  This is incompatible with the option <strong>-R</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-s</strong> <em>in-string out-string</em> ...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Bind each <em>in-string</em> to each <em>out-string</em>. When <em>in-string</em> is typed, <em>out-string</em> will be pushed back and treated as input to the line editor. When <strong>-R</strong> is also used, interpret the <em>in-string</em>s as ranges.</p><p>Note that both <em>in-string</em> and <em>out-string</em> are subject to the same form of interpretation, as described below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>in-string command</em> ...</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Bind each <em>in-string</em> to each <em>command</em>. When <strong>-R</strong> is used, interpret the <em>in-string</em>s as ranges.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>[ <em>in-string</em> ]</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>List key bindings.  If an <em>in-string</em> is specified, the binding of that string in the selected keymap is displayed.  Otherwise, all key bindings in the selected keymap are displayed.  (As a special case, if the <strong>-e</strong> or <strong>-v</strong> option is used alone, the keymap is <em>not</em> displayed - the implicit linking of keymaps is the only thing that happens.)</p><p>When the option <strong>-p</strong> is used, the <em>in-string</em> must be present. The listing shows all bindings which have the given key sequence as a prefix, not including any bindings for the key sequence itself.</p><p>When the <strong>-L</strong> option is used, the list is in the form of <strong>bindkey</strong> commands to create the key bindings.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>When the <strong>-R</strong> option is used as noted above, a valid range consists of two characters, with an optional `<strong>-</strong>' between them.  All characters between the two specified, inclusive, are bound as specified.</p><p>For either <em>in-string</em> or <em>out-string</em>, the following escape sequences are recognised:</p>

If the <strong>-r</strong> flag is given, the following string gives the prompt to display at the right.  If the <strong>-h</strong> flag is specified, the history can be accessed from ZLE. If the <strong>-e</strong> flag is given, typing <strong>^D</strong> (Control-D) on an empty line causes <strong>vared</strong> to exit immediately with a non-zero return value.</p><p>The <strong>-M</strong> option gives a keymap to link to the <strong>main</strong> keymap during editing, and the <strong>-m</strong> option gives a keymap to link to the <strong>vicmd</strong> keymap during editing.  For vi-style editing, this allows a pair of keymaps to override <strong>viins</strong> and <strong>vicmd</strong>.  For emacs-style editing, only <strong>-M</strong> is normally needed but the <strong>-m</strong> option may still be used.  On exit, the previous keymaps will be restored.</p><p><strong>Vared</strong> calls the usual `<strong>zle-line-init</strong>' and `<strong>zle-line-finish</strong>' hooks before and after it takes control. Using the <strong>-i</strong> and <strong>-f</strong> options, it is possible to replace these with other custom widgets.</p><p>If `<strong>-t</strong> <em>tty</em>' is given, <em>tty</em> is the name of a terminal device to be used instead of the default <strong>/dev/tty</strong>.  If <em>tty</em> does not refer to a terminal an error is reported.</p>

    <p>Only available if your system supports one of the `poll' or `select' system calls; most modern systems do.</p><p>Installs <em>handler</em> (the name of a shell function) to handle input from file descriptor <em>fd</em>.  Installing a handler for an <em>fd</em> which is already handled causes the existing handler to be replaced.  Any number of handlers for any number of readable file descriptors may be installed. Note that zle makes no attempt to check whether this <em>fd</em> is actually readable when installing the handler.  The user must make their own arrangements for handling the file descriptor when zle is not active.</p><p>When zle is attempting to read data, it will examine both the terminal and the list of handled <em>fd</em>'s.  If data becomes available on a handled <em>fd</em>, zle calls <em>handler</em> with the fd which is ready for reading as the first argument.  Under normal circumstances this is the only argument, but if an error was detected, a second argument provides details: `<strong>hup</strong>' for a disconnect, `<strong>nval</strong>' for a closed or otherwise invalid descriptor, or `<strong>err</strong>' for any other condition.  Systems that support only the `select' system call always use `<strong>err</strong>'.</p><p>If the option <strong>-w</strong> is also given, the <em>handler</em> is instead a line editor widget, typically a shell function made into a widget using `<strong>zle -N</strong>'.  In that case <em>handler</em> can use all the facilities of zle to update the current editing line.  Note, however, that as handling <em>fd</em> takes place at a low level changes to the display will not automatically appear; the widget should call `<strong>zle -R</strong>' to force redisplay.  As of this writing, widget handlers only support a single argument and thus are never passed a string for error state, so widgets must be prepared to test the descriptor themselves.</p><p>If either type of handler produces output to the terminal, it should call `<strong>zle -I</strong>' before doing so (see below).  Handlers should not attempt to read from the terminal.</p><p>If no <em>handler</em> is given, but an <em>fd</em> is present, any handler for that <em>fd</em> is removed.  If there is none, an error message is printed and status 1 is returned.</p><p>If no arguments are given, or the <strong>-L</strong> option is supplied, a list of handlers is printed in a form which can be stored for later execution.</p><p>An <em>fd</em> (but not a <em>handler</em>) may optionally be given with the <strong>-L</strong> option; in this case, the function will list the handler if any, else silently return status 1.</p><p>Note that this feature should be used with care.  Activity on one of the <em>fd</em>'s which is not properly handled can cause the terminal to become unusable.  Removing an <em>fd</em> handler from within a signal trap may cause unpredictable behavior.</p><p>Here is a simple example of using this feature.  A connection to a remote TCP port is created using the ztcp command; see the description of the <strong>zsh/net/tcp</strong> module in <a href="../man1/zshmodules.1.html"><strong>zshmodules</strong>(1)</a>.  Then a handler is installed which simply prints out any data which arrives on this connection.  Note that `select' will indicate that the file descriptor needs handling if the remote side has closed the connection; we handle that by testing for a failed read.</p>
<pre>
<strong>if ztcp pwspc 2811; then</strong>
  tcpfd=$REPLY
  handler() {
    zle -I
    local line
    if ! read -r line &lt;&$1; then
      # select marks this fd if we reach EOF,
      # so handle this specially.
      print "[Read on fd $1 failed, removing.]" &gt;&2
      zle -F $1
      return 1
    fi
    print -r - $line
  }
  zle -F $tcpfd handler
fi

    <p><strong>-I</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Unusually, this option is most useful outside ordinary widget functions, though it may be used within if normal output to the terminal is required. It invalidates the current zle display in preparation for output; typically this will be from a trap function.  It has no effect if zle is not active.  When a trap exits, the shell checks to see if the display needs restoring, hence the following will print output in such a way as not to disturb the line being edited:</p>
<pre>
<strong>TRAPUSR1() {</strong>
    # Invalidate zle display
  [[ -o zle ]] && zle -I
    # Show output
  print Hello
}
</pre>
<p>In general, the trap function may need to test whether zle is active before using this method (as shown in the example), since the <strong>zsh/zle</strong> module may not even be loaded; if it is not, the command can be skipped.</p><p>It is possible to call `<strong>zle -I</strong>' several times before control is returned to the editor; the display will only be invalidated the first time to minimise disruption.</p><p>Note that there are normally better ways of manipulating the display from within zle widgets; see, for example, `<strong>zle -R</strong>' above.</p><p>The returned status is zero if zle was invalidated, even though this may have been by a previous call to `<strong>zle -I</strong>' or by a system notification.  To test if a zle widget may be called at this point, execute <strong>zle</strong> with no arguments and examine the return status.</p>

    <p>This is used to add, list or remove internal transformations on the processing performed by the line editor.

This is used instead of outputting termcap codes to the terminal.  When the transformation is in operation the shell function is passed the termcap code that would be output as its first argument; if the operation required a numeric argument, that is passed as a second argument.  The function should set the shell variable <strong>REPLY</strong> to the transformed termcap code.  Typically this is used to produce some simply formatted version of the code and optional argument for debugging or testing.  Note that this transformation is not applied to other non-printing characters such as carriage returns and newlines.</p>

The previous keymap will be restored when the widget exits.</p><p>Normally, calling a widget in this way does not set the special parameter <strong>WIDGET</strong> and related parameters, so that the environment appears as if the top-level widget called by the user were still active.  With the option <strong>-w</strong>, <strong>WIDGET</strong> and related parameters are set to reflect the widget being executed by the <strong>zle</strong> call.</p><p>Any further arguments will be passed to the widget; note that as standard argument handling is performed, any general argument list should be preceded by <strong>-</strong><strong>-</strong>.  If it is a shell function, these are passed down as positional parameters; for builtin widgets it is up to the widget in question what it does with them. Currently arguments are only handled by the incremental-search commands, the <strong>history-search-forward</strong> and <strong>-backward</strong> and the corresponding functions prefixed by <strong>vi-</strong>, and by <strong>universal-argument</strong>.  No error is flagged if the command does not use the arguments, or only uses some of them.</p><p>The return status reflects the success or failure of the operation carried out by the widget, or if it is a user-defined widget the return status of the shell function.</p><p>A non-zero return status causes the shell to beep when the widget exits, unless the <strong>BEEP</strong> options was unset or the widget was called via the <strong>zle</strong> command.  Thus if a user defined widget requires an immediate beep, it should call the <strong>beep</strong> widget directly.</p>

<p>All actions in the editor are performed by `widgets'.  A widget's job is simply to perform some small action.  The ZLE commands that key sequences in keymaps are bound to are in fact widgets.  Widgets can be user-defined or built in.</p><p>The standard widgets built into ZLE are listed in Standard Widgets below. Other built-in widgets can be defined by other modules (see <a href="../man1/zshmodules.1.html"><strong>zshmodules</strong>(1)</a>).  Each built-in widget has two names: its normal canonical name, and the same name preceded by a `<strong>.</strong>'.  The `<strong>.</strong>' name is special: it can't be rebound to a different widget.  This makes the widget available even when its usual name has been redefined.</p><p>User-defined widgets are defined using `<strong>zle -N</strong>', and implemented as shell functions.  When the widget is executed, the corresponding shell function is executed, and can perform editing (or other) actions. It is recommended that user-defined widgets should not have names starting with `<strong>.</strong>'.</p>

<p>User-defined widgets, being implemented as shell functions, can execute any normal shell command.

The standard input of the function is closed to prevent external commands from unintentionally blocking ZLE by reading from the terminal, but <strong>read -k</strong> or <strong>read -q</strong> can be used to read characters.  Finally, they can examine and edit the ZLE buffer being edited by reading and setting the special parameters described below.</p><p>These special parameters are always available in widget functions, but are not in any way special outside ZLE.  If they have some normal value outside ZLE, that value is temporarily inaccessible, but will return when the widget function exits.

    <p>Text to be displayed after the end of the editable text buffer.  This does not have to be a complete line; to display a complete line, a newline must be prepended explicitly.  The text is reset on each new invocation (but not recursive invocation) of zle.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>RBUFFER</strong> (scalar)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The part of the buffer that lies to the right of the cursor position. If it is assigned to, only that part of the buffer is replaced, and the cursor remains between the old <strong>$LBUFFER</strong> and the new <strong>$RBUFFER</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>REGION_ACTIVE</strong> (integer)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Indicates if the region is currently active.  It can be assigned 0 or 1 to deactivate and activate the region respectively; see <em>Character Highlighting</em> below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>region_highlight</strong> (array)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Each element of this array may be set to a string that describes highlighting for an arbitrary region of the command line that will take effect the next time the command line is redisplayed.  Highlighting of the non-editable parts of the command line in <strong>PREDISPLAY</strong> and <strong>POSTDISPLAY</strong> are possible, but note that the <strong>P</strong> flag is needed for character indexing to include <strong>PREDISPLAY</strong>.</p><p>Each string consists of the following parts:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>&bull;</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Optionally, a `<strong>P</strong>' to signify that the start and end offset that follow include any string set by the <strong>PREDISPLAY</strong> special parameter; this is needed if the predisplay string itself is to be highlighted. Whitespace may follow the `<strong>P</strong>'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&bull;</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A start offset in the same units as <strong>CURSOR</strong>, terminated by whitespace.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&bull;</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>An end offset in the same units as <strong>CURSOR</strong>, terminated by whitespace.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>&bull;</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A highlight specification in the same format as used for contexts in the parameter <strong>zle_highlight</strong>, see Character Highlighting below; for example, <strong>standout</strong> or <strong>fg=red,bold</strong></p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre>
<strong>region_highlight=("P0 20 bold")</strong>
</pre>
<p>specifies that the first twenty characters of the text including any predisplay string should be highlighted in bold.</p><p>Note that the effect of <strong>region_highlight</strong> is not saved and disappears as soon as the line is accepted.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>UNDO_CHANGE_NO</strong> (integer)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A number representing the state of the undo history.  The only use of this is passing as an argument to the <strong>undo</strong> widget in order to undo back to the recorded point.  Read-only.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>WIDGET</strong> (scalar)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The name of the widget currently being executed; read-only.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>WIDGETFUNC</strong> (scalar)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The name of the shell function that implements a widget defined with either <strong>zle -N</strong> or <strong>zle -C</strong>.  In the former case, this is the second argument to the <strong>zle -N</strong> command that defined the widget, or the first argument if there was no second argument.  In the latter case this is the third argument to the <strong>zle -C</strong> command that defined the widget.  Read-only.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>WIDGETSTYLE</strong> (scalar)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Describes the implementation behind the completion widget currently being executed; the second argument that followed <strong>zle -C</strong> when the widget was defined.  This is the name of a builtin completion widget.  For widgets defined with <strong>zle -N</strong> this is set to the empty string.  Read-only.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ZLE_STATE</strong> (scalar)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Contains a set of space-separated words that describe the current <strong>zle</strong> state.</p><p>Currently, the states shown are the insert mode as set by the <strong>overwrite-mode</strong> or <strong>vi-replace</strong> widgets and whether history commands will visit imported entries as controlled by the set-local-history widget. The string contains `<strong>insert</strong>' if characters to be inserted on the command line move existing characters to the right or `<strong>overwrite</strong>' if characters to be inserted overwrite existing characters. It contains `<strong>localhistory</strong>' if only local history commands will be visited or `<strong>globalhistory</strong>' if imported history commands will also be visited.</p><p>The substrings are sorted in alphabetical order so that if you want to test for two specific substrings in a future-proof way, you can do match by doing:</p>
<pre>
<strong>if [[ $ZLE_STATE == *insert*globalhistory* ]]; then ...; fi</strong>

</dl>
<h3>Special Widgets</h3>
<p>There are a few user-defined widgets which are special to the shell. If they do not exist, no special action is taken.  The environment provided is identical to that for any other editing widget.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>zle-isearch-exit</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Executed at the end of incremental search at the point where the isearch prompt is removed from the display.  See <strong>zle-isearch-update</strong> for an example.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>zle-isearch-update</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Executed within incremental search when the display is about to be redrawn.  Additional output below the incremental search prompt can be generated by using `<strong>zle -M</strong>' within the widget.  For example,</p>
<pre>
<strong>zle-isearch-update() { zle -M "Line $HISTNO"; }</strong>
zle -N zle-isearch-update
</pre>
<p>Note the line output by `<strong>zle -M</strong>' is not deleted on exit from incremental search.  This can be done from a <strong>zle-isearch-exit</strong> widget:</p>
<pre>
<strong>zle-isearch-exit() { zle -M ""; }</strong>
zle -N zle-isearch-exit
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>zle-line-init</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Executed every time the line editor is started to read a new line of input.  The following example puts the line editor into vi command mode when it starts up.</p>
<pre>
<strong>zle-line-init() { zle -K vicmd; }</strong>
zle -N zle-line-init
</pre>
<p>(The command inside the function sets the keymap directly; it is equivalent to <strong>zle vi-cmd-mode</strong>.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>zle-line-finish</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is similar to <strong>zle-line-init</strong> but is executed every time the line editor has finished reading a line of input.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>zle-history-line-set</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Executed when the history line changes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>zle-keymap-select</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Executed every time the keymap changes, i.e. the special parameter <strong>KEYMAP</strong> is set to a different value, while the line editor is active. Initialising the keymap when the line editor starts does not cause the widget to be called.</p><p>The value <strong>$KEYMAP</strong> within the function reflects the new keymap.  The old keymap is passed as the sole argument.</p><p>This can be used for detecting switches between the vi command (<strong>vicmd</strong>) and insert (usually <strong>main</strong>) keymaps.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The following is a list of all the standard widgets, and their default bindings in emacs mode, vi command mode and vi insert mode (the `<strong>emacs</strong>', `<strong>vicmd</strong>' and `<strong>viins</strong>' keymaps, respectively).</p><p>Note that cursor keys are bound to movement keys in all three keymaps; the shell assumes that the cursor keys send the key sequences reported by the terminal-handling library (termcap or terminfo).  The key sequences shown in the list are those based on the VT100, common on many modern terminals, but in fact these are not necessarily bound.  In the case of the <strong>viins</strong> keymap, the initial escape character of the sequences serves also to return to the <strong>vicmd</strong> keymap: whether this happens is determined by the <strong>KEYTIMEOUT</strong> parameter, see <a href="../man1/zshparam.1.html"><strong>zshparam</strong>(1)</a>.</p><h3>Movement</h3>

    <p>Search backward incrementally for a specified string.  The search is case-insensitive if the search string does not have uppercase letters and no numeric argument was given.  The string may begin with `<strong>^</strong>' to anchor the search to the beginning of the line.

Keys are looked up in the special <strong>isearch</strong> keymap, and if not found there in the main keymap (note that by default the <strong>isearch</strong> keymap is empty). An interrupt signal, as defined by the stty setting, will stop the search and go back to the original line.  An undefined key will have the same effect.  Note that the following always perform the same task within incremental searches and cannot be replaced by user defined widgets, nor can the set of functions be extended.

This will be treated as a string of keys, as for arguments to the <strong>bindkey</strong> command, and used as initial input for the command.  Any characters in the string which are unused by the incremental search will be silently ignored.  For example,</p>
<pre>
<strong>zle history-incremental-search-backward forceps</strong>

    <p>These widgets behave similarly to the corresponding widgets with no <strong>-pattern</strong>, but the search string typed by the user is treated as a pattern, respecting the current settings of the various options affecting pattern matching.  See FILENAME GENERATION in <a href="../man1/zshexpn.1.html"><strong>zshexpn</strong>(1)</a> for a description of patterns. If no numeric argument was given lowercase letters in the search string may match uppercase letters in the history.  The string may begin with `<strong>^</strong>' to anchor the search to the beginning of the line.</p><p>The prompt changes to indicate an invalid pattern; this may simply indicate the pattern is not yet complete.</p><p>Note that only non-overlapping matches are reported, so an expression with wildcards may return fewer matches on a line than are visible by inspection.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>vi-history-search-backward</strong> (unbound) (/) (unbound)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Search backward in the history for a specified string. The string may begin with `<strong>^</strong>' to anchor the search to the beginning of the line.</p><p>A restricted set of editing functions is available in the mini-buffer.  An interrupt signal, as defined by the stty setting,  will stop the search. The functions available in the mini-buffer are: <strong>accept-line</strong>, <strong>backward-delete-char</strong>, <strong>vi-backward-delete-char</strong>, <strong>backward-kill-word</strong>, <strong>vi-backward-kill-word</strong>, <strong>clear-screen</strong>, <strong>redisplay</strong>, <strong>quoted-insert</strong> and <strong>vi-quoted-insert</strong>.</p><p><strong>vi-cmd-mode</strong> is treated the same as accept-line, and <strong>magic-space</strong> is treated as a space. Any other character that is not bound to self-insert or self-insert-unmeta will beep and be ignored. If the function is called from vi command mode, the bindings of the current insert mode will be used.</p><p>If called from a function by the <strong>zle</strong> command with arguments, the first argument is taken as the string for which to search, rather than the first word in the buffer.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>history-search-forward</strong> (ESC-N ESC-n) (unbound) (unbound)</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>vi-history-search-forward</strong> (unbound) (?) (unbound)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Search forward in the history for a specified string. The string may begin with `<strong>^</strong>' to anchor the search to the beginning of the line. The functions available in the mini-buffer are the same as for <strong>vi-history-search-backward</strong>.  Argument handling is also the same as for that command.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>infer-next-history</strong> (^X^N) (unbound) (unbound)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Search in the history list for a line matching the current one and fetch the event following it.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>insert-last-word</strong> (ESC-_ ESC-.) (unbound) (unbound)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Insert the last word from the previous history event at the cursor position.  If a positive numeric argument is given, insert that word from the end of the previous history event. If the argument is zero or negative insert that word from the left (zero inserts the previous command word).  Repeating this command replaces the word just inserted with the last word from the history event prior to the one just used; numeric arguments can be used in the same way to pick a word from that event.</p><p>When called from a shell function invoked from a user-defined widget, the command can take one to three arguments.  The first argument specifies a history offset which applies to successive calls to this widget: if it is -1, the default behaviour is used, while if it is 1, successive calls will move forwards through the history.  The value 0 can be used to indicate that the history line examined by the previous execution of the command will be reexamined.  Note that negative numbers should be preceded by a `<strong>-</strong><strong>-</strong>' argument to avoid confusing them with options.</p><p>If two arguments are given, the second specifies the word on the command line in normal array index notation (as a more natural alternative to the prefix argument).  Hence 1 is the first word, and -1 (the default) is the last word.</p><p>If a third argument is given, its value is ignored, but it is used to signify that the history offset is relative to the current history line, rather than the one remembered after the previous invocations of <strong>insert-last-word</strong>.</p><p>For example, the default behaviour of the command corresponds to</p>
<pre>
<strong>zle insert-last-word -- -1 -1</strong>
</pre>
<p>while the command</p>
<pre>
<strong>zle insert-last-word -- -1 1 -</strong>
</pre>
<p>always copies the first word of the line in the history immediately before the line being edited.  This has the side effect that later invocations of the widget will be relative to that line.</p>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>digit-argument</strong> (ESC-0..ESC-9) (1-9) (unbound)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Start a new numeric argument, or add to the current one. See also <strong>vi-digit-or-beginning-of-line</strong>.  This only works if bound to a key sequence ending in a decimal digit.</p><p>Inside a widget function, a call to this function treats the last key of the key sequence which called the widget as the digit.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>neg-argument</strong> (ESC--) (unbound) (unbound)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Changes the sign of the following argument.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>universal-argument</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Multiply the argument of the next command by 4.  Alternatively, if this command is followed by an integer (positive or negative), use that as the argument for the next command.  Thus digits cannot be repeated using this command.  For example, if this command occurs twice, followed immediately by <strong>forward-char</strong>, move forward sixteen spaces; if instead it is followed by <strong>-2</strong>, then <strong>forward-char</strong>, move backward two spaces.</p><p>Inside a widget function, if passed an argument, i.e. `<strong>zle</strong> universal-argument <em>num</em>', the numerical argument will be set to <em>num</em>; this is equivalent to `<strong>NUMERIC=</strong><em>num</em>'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>argument-base</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use the existing numeric argument as a numeric base, which must be in the range 2 to 36 inclusive.  Subsequent use of <strong>digit-argument</strong> and <strong>universal-argument</strong> will input a new prefix in the given base. The usual hexadecimal convention is used: the letter <strong>a</strong> or <strong>A</strong> corresponds to 10, and so on.  Arguments in bases requiring digits from 10 upwards are more conveniently input with <strong>universal-argument</strong>, since <strong>ESC-a</strong> etc. are not usually bound to <strong>digit-argument</strong>.</p><p>The function can be used with a command argument inside a user-defined widget.  The following code sets the base to 16 and lets the user input a hexadecimal argument until a key out of the digit range is typed:</p>
<pre>
<strong>zle argument-base 16</strong>
zle universal-argument
</pre>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>execute-named-cmd</strong> (ESC-x) (:) (unbound)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Read the name of an editor command and execute it.  A restricted set of editing functions is available in the mini-buffer.  Keys are looked up in the special <strong>command</strong> keymap, and if not found there in the main keymap. An interrupt signal, as defined by the stty setting, will abort the function.  Note that the following always perform the same task within the <strong>executed-named-cmd</strong> environment and cannot be replaced by user defined widgets, nor can the set of functions be extended.  The allowed functions are: <strong>backward-delete-char</strong>, <strong>vi-backward-delete-char</strong>, <strong>clear-screen</strong>, <strong>redisplay</strong>, <strong>quoted-insert</strong>, <strong>vi-quoted-insert</strong>, <strong>backward-kill-word</strong>, <strong>vi-backward-kill-word</strong>, <strong>kill-whole-line</strong>, <strong>vi-kill-line</strong>, <strong>backward-kill-line</strong>, <strong>list-choices</strong>, <strong>delete-char-or-list</strong>, <strong>complete-word</strong>, <strong>accept-line</strong>, <strong>expand-or-complete</strong> and <strong>expand-or-complete-prefix</strong>.</p><p><strong>kill-region</strong> kills the last word, and vi-cmd-mode is treated the same as accept-line. The space and tab characters, if not bound to one of these functions, will complete the name and then list the possibilities if the <strong>AUTO_LIST</strong> option is set. Any other character that is not bound to <strong>self-insert</strong> or <strong>self-insert-unmeta</strong> will beep and be ignored. The bindings of the current insert mode will be used.</p><p>Currently this command may not be redefined or called by name.</p>

    <p>If there is no # character at the beginning of the buffer, add one to the beginning of each line. If there is one, remove a # from each line that has one.

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>push-input</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Push the entire current multiline construct onto the buffer stack and return to the top-level (<strong>PS1</strong>) prompt. If the current parser construct is only a single line, this is exactly like <strong>push-line</strong>. Next time the editor starts up or is popped with <strong>get-line</strong>, the construct will be popped off the top of the buffer stack and loaded into the editing buffer.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>push-line</strong> (^Q ESC-Q ESC-q) (unbound) (unbound)</p>
  </dt>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>push-line-or-edit</strong></p>

  <dd>
    <p>At the top-level (<strong>PS1</strong>) prompt, equivalent to <strong>push-line</strong>. At a secondary (<strong>PS2</strong>) prompt, move the entire current multiline construct into the editor buffer. The latter is equivalent to <strong>push-input</strong> followed by <strong>get-line</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>read-command</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Only useful from a user-defined widget.  A keystroke is read just as in normal operation, but instead of the command being executed the name of the command that would be executed is stored in the shell parameter <strong>REPLY</strong>.  This can be used as the argument of a future <strong>zle</strong> command.  If the key sequence is not bound, status 1 is returned; typically, however, <strong>REPLY</strong> is set to <strong>undefined-key</strong> to indicate a useless key sequence.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>recursive-edit</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Only useful from a user-defined widget.  At this point in the function, the editor regains control until one of the standard widgets which would normally cause zle to exit (typically an <strong>accept-line</strong> caused by hitting the return key) is executed.  Instead, control returns to the user-defined widget.  The status returned is non-zero if the return was caused by an error, but the function still continues executing and hence may tidy up.  This makes it safe for the user-defined widget to alter the command line or key bindings temporarily.</p><p>The following widget, <strong>caps-lock</strong>, serves as an example.</p>
<pre>
<strong>self-insert-ucase() {</strong>
  LBUFFER+=${(U)KEYS[-1]}
}

integer stat

zle -N self-insert self-insert-ucase
zle -A caps-lock save-caps-lock
zle -A accept-line caps-lock

zle recursive-edit
stat=$?

zle -A .self-insert self-insert
zle -A save-caps-lock caps-lock
zle -D save-caps-lock

(( stat )) && zle send-break

return $stat

</pre>
<p>This causes typed letters to be inserted capitalised until either <strong>accept-line</strong> (i.e. typically the return key) is typed or the <strong>caps-lock</strong> widget is invoked again; the later is handled by saving the old definition of <strong>caps-lock</strong> as <strong>save-caps-lock</strong> and then rebinding it to invoke <strong>accept-line</strong>.  Note that an error from the recursive edit is detected as a non-zero return status and propagated by using the <strong>send-break</strong> widget.</p>
  </dd>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Force the prompts on both the left and right of the screen to be re-expanded, then redisplay the edit buffer.  This reflects changes both to the prompt variables themselves and changes in the expansion of the values (for example, changes in time or directory, or changes to the value of variables referred to by the prompt).</p><p>Otherwise, the prompt is only expanded each time zle starts, and when the display as been interrupted by output from another part of the shell (such as a job notification) which causes the command line to be reprinted.</p>

<p>The line editor has the ability to highlight characters or regions of the line that have a particular significance.  This is controlled by the array parameter <strong>zle_highlight</strong>, if it has been set by the user.</p><p>If the parameter contains the single entry <strong>none</strong> all highlighting is turned off.  Note the parameter is still expected to be an array.</p><p>Otherwise each entry of the array should consist of a word indicating a context for highlighting, then a colon, then a comma-separated list of the types of highlighting to apply in that context.</p><p>The contexts available for highlighting are the following:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>

The region can be deactivated by calling <strong>set-mark-command</strong> with a negative prefix argument, or reactivated by calling <strong>exchange-point-and-mark</strong> with a zero prefix argument.

    <p>No highlighting is applied to the given context.  It is not useful for this to appear with other types of highlighting; it is used to override a default.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>fg=</strong><em>colour</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The foreground colour should be set to <em>colour</em>, a decimal integer or the name of one of the eight most widely-supported colours.</p><p>Not all terminals support this and, of those that do, not all provide facilities to test the support, hence the user should decide based on the terminal type.  Most terminals support the colours <strong>black</strong>, <strong>red</strong>, <strong>green</strong>, <strong>yellow</strong>, <strong>blue</strong>, <strong>magenta</strong>, <strong>cyan</strong> and <strong>white</strong>, which can be set by name.  In addition. <strong>default</strong> may be used to set the terminal's default foreground colour.  Abbreviations are allowed; <strong>b</strong> or <strong>bl</strong> selects black.  Some terminals may generate additional colours if the <strong>bold</strong> attribute is also present.</p><p>On recent terminals and on systems with an up-to-date terminal database the number of colours supported may be tested by the command `<strong>echotc</strong> Co'; if this succeeds, it indicates a limit on the number of colours which will be enforced by the line editor.  The number of colours is in any case limited to 256 (i.e. the range 0 to 255).</p><p>Colour is also known as color.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bold</strong></p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>standout</strong></p>

  <dd>
    <p>The characters in the given context are shown in the terminal's standout mode.  The actual effect is specific to the terminal; on many terminals it is inverse video.  On some such terminals, where the cursor does not blink it appears with standout mode negated, making it less than clear where the cursor actually is.  On such terminals one of the other effects may be preferable for highlighting the region and matched search string.</p>

If the <strong>MULTIBYTE</strong> option is in effect, multibyte characters not in the ASCII character set that are reported as having zero width are treated as combining characters when the option <strong>COMBINING_CHARS</strong> is on.  If the option is off, or if a character appears where a combining character is not valid, the character is treated as unprintable.</p><p>Unprintable multibyte characters are shown as a hexadecimal number between angle brackets.  The number is the code point of the character in the wide character set; this may or may not be Unicode, depending on the operating system.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the <strong>MULTIBYTE</strong> option is in effect, any sequence of one or more bytes that does not form a valid character in the current character set is treated as a series of bytes each shown as a special character. This case can be distinguished from other unprintable characters as the bytes are represented as two hexadecimal digits between angle brackets, as distinct from the four or eight digits that are used for unprintable characters that are nonetheless valid in the current character set.</p><p>Not all systems support this: for it to work, the system's representation of wide characters must be code values from the Universal Character Set, as defined by IS0 10646 (also known as Unicode).</p>
