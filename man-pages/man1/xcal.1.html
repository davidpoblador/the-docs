        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><em>Xcal</em> is an interactive calendar program. The user interface has several levels. When started, <em>xcal</em> displays today's date in a small command box that is intended to sit on the screen as a companion to the <em>xclock</em> program. The format of the command box may be altered using the resource manager, so you are not stuck with my preferred layout. You can set the time in the window too, if you wish (see the format resource). Access to further levels in <em>xcal</em> is made by clicking a mouse button in the command box. The command box is split into several areas and clicking on one of these will popup a window supporting a new function.</p><p>Clicking with mouse button one on the question mark in the command box pops up a help window. <em>Xcal</em> comes with many help buttons. When you are convinced they are no longer any use to you, they can all be turned off using an X resource.</p><p>A small button containing a `mouse' bitmap can be pressed with mouse button one to inspect appointments for today. This generates a panel showing information from the calendar file for today and information from a set of seven daily files holding regular commitments. The panel also contains a text scratchpad, `the memo panel'. This allows the editing of a memo file.</p><p>The calendar functions are accessed by clicking a mouse buttons inside date portion of the command window.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    1)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Mouse button one pops up a calendar `strip' for the current month. The strip has some header lines and then one line per day of the month. The `line per day' display contains the day in the month and the day of the week. Today may be highlighted specially - the notion of Today alters at midnight. The strip has a help button which displays a description of the panel. Command buttons in the header line allows the user to bring up a strip for the previous or the next month.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    2)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Pressing mouse button two in the date area will bring up a dialogue box which allows the user to select any month of any year (yes, September 1752 is supported). The month may be input as month name or abbreviation, even though the prompt indicates a more restrictive format.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    3)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Pressing mouse button 3 in the date label causes the whole program to exit, a dialog box is used to ask the user for confirmation.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Like <em>xcalendar</em>, daily events are stored in set of files, one for each day. If the file exists when the strip is started, its data is displayed as the label in the command button on the right-hand side of the month strip. The file is created and edited by entering a simple text editor (the standard text widget) which is started by pressing the right hand side of the appropriate day line in the strip. You can also add data to the file by selecting a string on the screen and clicking with the middle button on the right-hand side of the month strip. The string is appended to the file for the day. This short-hand allows one entry to be loaded into several day files.</p><p>The width of the month strip is computed from the width of the header. Users who wish to display a wider strip to show more of the stored information should widen the strip using the <em>minStripWidth</em> resource (see below).</p><p>The colours and fonts used in the strip is controllable by resources. The widget that comprises each line in the strip is tagged with the short form name of the day, so it's easy to vary the strip display showing weekends differently from the weekdays.</p><p>Data files are stored in a directory usually called <strong>Calendar</strong> under the user's home directory. Each file is stored in a subdirectory containing all the data for a particular year. This is incompatible with <em>xcalendar</em>, the user may specify that the compatibility should be maintained.</p><p>Alarms are supported by <em>xcal</em>. When a line in the data file starts with a digit, it is assumed to be a time specification and a candidate for an alarm. The line contains a string giving the alarm time and a text string displayed in a dialogue alarm box that pops up when the alarm fires. You can also arrange for countdown alarms to fire, so that you can be told that something is about to happen. These dialogue boxes will automatically go away after two minutes, unless the `Stick' button is pressed glueing the box onto the screen. The box can be made to go away at any time by hitting the `Unpin' button.</p><p>When specifying alarms, <em>Xcal</em> tries to be liberal about the times that it understands. Time specifications are: h, hh, hhmm, hmm, hh:mm, h:mm, hh.mm, h.mm; all of these may be optionally followed by an am/pm indicator - one of: A, a, AM, am, Am, aM, P, p, PM, pm, Pm, pM. Times must always be followed by at least one space or tab. Some legal examples are:</p>
<pre>
	12:00 Lunch - Meet Joe at Burger King
	14.30 Meeting in the cafeteria
	2:30p Ring Mark
	7pm Pizza
</pre>
<p>You can make a time like 2:30 mean 14:30 by setting the resource <em>AlarmWarp</em> to be true. If this is the case, an alarm hour will be promoted to a PM time if it is found to be between the range of zero and the value of the resource <em>minAlarmWarp</em>.</p><p><em>Xcal</em> also supports timed command execution from the data file. To trigger a command, the data part of the line starts with an exclamation mark, eg:</p><p>	4.30pm !xmessage -message 'ring home'</p><p>The exclamation mark can also be replaced by the string `%cron'. It is also possible to make <em>xcal</em> execute a command whenever an alarm is triggered, see the <em>Cmd</em> resource below.</p><p>The memo function of <em>Xcal</em> is accessed by pressing the non-date portion of the command window. This shows a bitmap diagram of three mouse buttons. Clicking the left mouse button in this area brings up a complex panel, clicking on the button again will pop it back down again. The top half of the panel displays the information held in the diary for today; pressing the Edit button here will start an edit box for today. The next section of the panel displays the information held in the weekly files. Again you cannot directly change the text in this area, you must press on the Edit button to bring up a strip enabling you to change things. The bottom portion of the panel is an edit window displaying the contents of a file usually called `memo' in the Calendar directory. The idea of this panel is to allow you to access your current information in one button click.</p><p>It is obviously possible to change <em>Xcal</em>'s data files without using the inbuilt text widget editor. In general, <em>Xcal</em> will not notice this. Editing random day files with a standard text editor will not change the contents of any displayed strips until the strips are popped down and up again. <em>Xcal</em> knows what days have been altered when the text widget is used to edit the day files, and will reflect any change immediately into the displayed strips.</p><p>You can make <em>Xcal</em> take notice of today's date file and the current memo file. The `Update' resource sets a polling time in seconds. When the clock fires and today's file has been altered, the alarm list is rebuilt from the current date file and the memo panel is updated. The bottom part of the memo panel is also updated if the `memo' file has been altered on the clock tick.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Version 4 of <em>Xcal</em> permits one user to view another's calendar by giving the <em>-u</em> option followed by the user's login name. The user's calendar storage area is assumed to be called `Calendar' in their home directory. The facilities are somewhat rudimentary. First, the main date box will have the user's login name appended to the date format string. When a month strip is generated, you will be given read-only access to their calendar files, assuming that the file permissions allow you to read them. This is intended to be one step better than using <em>cat</em> on their calendar files.</p><p>The <em>-debug</em> switch causes contents of the initial date window to be incremented very frequently, this allows some testing of the program.</p><p>The <em>-alarmscan</em> switch prints debugging information about the alarm system on standard output.</p><p>The argument following the <em>-format</em> is a date format used to display dates in the top level window (see below, the <em>Format</em> resource). Changing this to include a time format will make <em>xcal</em> display a clock in your top level window.</p><p>The argument following the <em>-stripfmt</em> argument is a date format used to display month names and years in the monthly calendar strip. (see the resource <em>StripFmt</em>).</p><p>Similarly, the <em>-editfmt</em> argument is the format for dates used in an edit window (see the <em>Editfmt</em> resource).</p><p>The <em>-clocktick</em> argument is used to set the clock update time of the main date window, should a time be displayed as well as the date. See the <em>Clocktick</em> resource.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">RESOURCES</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>As with all standard X applications, <em>xcal</em> may be customised through entries in the resource manager. It is a serious mistake to install <em>Xcal</em> without putting the resource initialisation file <em>Xcal</em> in <em>/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults</em>. Resource class names are listed below; resource instance names are identical, except the first letter is in lower case. The following resource manager entries are defined:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Debug</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If True enables accelerated time. Alarms will not function correctly. Default: False.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>OtherUser</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>the name of the user whose calendar files will be inspected. This is usually set by the <strong>-u</strong> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AlarmScan</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If True enables printing of alarm related debugging information to the standard output. Default: False.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ReverseVideo</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If true display the output in reverse video. Default: False.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Format</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a format string used to create the contents of the top command button and the memo box. The format is aimed at the system routine: <em>strftime</em>. I have chosen to use the system routine because it makes it easier for non-english language sites to generate their own formats. However, this means that the names used for months and days may not be compatible with the ones set in the resources below. Any characters in the format string are passed to the output unchanged unless they specify a format. Format letters are preceded by a `%' character and can be found in the documentation for <em>strftime</em> on your system. The SunOS 4.1.3 routine supports:</p>
<pre>
%%	same as %
%a	day of week using abbreviated name
%A	day of week using full weekday names
%b	(%h) month, using locale's abbreviated names
%B	month, using locale's full names
%c	date and time as %x %X
%C	date and time, in local long-format date and
	time representation
%d	day of month (01-31)
%D	date as %m/%d/%y
%e	day of month (1-31; single digits are preceded  by a blank)
%H	hour (00-23)
%I	hour (00-12)
%j	day number of year (001-366)
%k	hour (0-23; single digits are preceded by a blank)
%l	hour (1-12; single digits are preceded by a blank)
%m	month number (01-12)
%M	minute (00-59)
%n	same as &#92;n
%p	local equivalent of AM or PM
%r	time as %I:%M:%S %p
%R	time as %H:%M
%S	seconds (00-59)
%t	same as &#92;t
%U	week number of year (01-52), Sunday is the first day of the week
%W	week number of year (01-52), Monday is the first day of the week
%x	date, using locale's date format
%X	time, using locale's time format
%y	year within century (00-99)
%Y	year, including century (fore example, 1988)
%Z	time zone abbreviation
</pre>
<p>The default is "%A %d %B %Y", printing the day, the date, the month and the full year. I prefer to use "%A %e %B %Y", but this does not seem to be portable to different systems. The format string is scanned to determine the update frequency that is needed to maintain a correct date image. The default needs updating every 24 hours, if you insert an AM/PM format then the strip will be updated every 12 hours. Adding an hour specification will cause an update every hour and specifying minutes or seconds will cause appropriate behaviour.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ClockTick</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If you specify a second hand in the main date string and only want it updated every 30 seconds (say) then setting the ClockTick resource to 30 will force an update for that period. Default: 0 (derived from the <em>Format</em> string).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>StripFmt</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>is used to format the date line at the top of each strip. This uses an internal version of the <em>strftime</em> routine that only supports format characters relating to months, years and days. The supported format characters are: %A, %a, %B, %b, %h, %D, %d, %e, %m, %n, %t, %x, %y and %%. Long/short day and month names are taken from the resources. Default: "%B %y".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>EditFmt</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>provides the format string for any edit window. This uses the same code as <strong>StripFmt</strong>. Default: "%A %d %B %Y". Again, I prefer to use "%A %e %B %Y".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MarkToday</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If True then highlight today. Default True.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>TodayBackground</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>the background colour when marking, default Black.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>TodayForeground</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>the foreground colour when marking today, default White.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>FontToday</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Today may be marked by using a special font, if this is desired the font is given by this resource. Default is to use the default font.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Directory</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The name of the directory under the home directory where the day files are stored. Default: Calendar.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>XcalendarCompat</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If true then subdirectories are not created in the Calendar directory. This flag is not relevant when files are being read, so users can use both programs with existing data files. Default: False.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>GiveHelp</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If True than access to the help information is given. If False, help buttons disappear returning screen real-estate to the user. You should resist setting this to False in the default resources file. Default: True.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>HelpFromFile</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <em>Xcal</em> program will usually have help strings compiled into it. These are in English and it may be desirable to use help data in other languages. If this resource is true, it forces <em>Xcal</em> to look in a data file for the help strings. Default: False.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>HelpFile</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>gives the name of the file used as a database for the help system, accessed when <strong>HelpFromFile</strong> is True. Default: /usr/lib/X11/XCal.help.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>InitialCalendar</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If True then the calendar for this month is automatically displayed on startup. If False, the calendar is not automatically displayed. Default: False.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>InitialEdit</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If True then an edit window for today is automatically displayed on startup if a file exists for today's date. If False, the edit window is not automatically displayed. Default: False.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>InitialMemo</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If True then the memo window is automatically displayed on startup. Default: False.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>UseWmTitle</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If True display the month and the year at the head of each strip. This information is duplicated if your window manager uses titles so it is nice to be able to turn it off. Default: True.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>TextBufferSize</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>the maximum number of bytes which we are prepared to deal with in an edit window. Default: 2048 bytes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Alarms</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>whether or not to enable the alarm system. Default: True.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ExecAlarms</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>if the alarm system is active, whether or not to invoke timed-execution commands. Default: True.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Update</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When scanning for alarms in the current day file <em>Xcal</em> inspects it at program startup time and also when it is edited using the normal built-in editing mechanism. However, if some external program changes t file <em>xcal</em> will not see the new contents and new alarms will not be set. Setting this resource to non-zero will force <em>xcal</em> to scan the file every `update' seconds looking for alterations in size and modification date. When it detects that the file is altered, then it will rebuild the internal alarm list. Default: zero.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Nbeeps</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When an alarm window is popped up, it is accompanied by `Nbeeps' beeps. Default: 3.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Volume</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Control the loudness of the beep. Default: 50.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Cmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This resource contains a command that is executed by calling the shell when every alarm is triggered. The command is passed the contents of the data line as one argument.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Countdown</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>contains a comma separated string of numbers; for example: 10,5,0. The string allows the user to customise warning alarms: so in the example, alarm boxes will be displayed 10 minutes before the stated time, 5 minutes before the stated time and exactly on the stated time. Commands lines in the data prefaced by a `!' will always be triggered exactly at the stated time. Default: 10,0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Autoquit</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Each dialogue box containing an alarm message contains an `Unpin' button allowing the user to remove the message from the screen by using mouse button one. Additionally, the message box can remove itself from the screen after a specified period, this resource gives that timeout in seconds. If the resource is set to zero, then the user is always forced to take explicit action to remove the box. Default: 120, alarm boxes disappear after 2 mins.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Alarmleft</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>contains a <em>printf</em> string that is displayed in the label at the top of an alarm box when countdown is in operation and there is some time before the stated time. The time before the stated time is supplied as the second argument to printf. Default: ``%d minutes before...''</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Alarmnow</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>contains the <em>printf</em> string that is displayed in the label at the top of an alarm box when the stated time is reached. Default: ``Time is now...''.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>UseMemo</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>enables the use of the memo feature. This defaults to ``True'', but is present to allow users to make <em>XCal</em> have as it used to.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MemoLeft</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>affects the placing of the memo button in the top level date window. The default is `True' meaning that the button box is placed on the left of the date portion. Setting this to `False' will place the button box to the right of the date portions.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MemoFile</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>gives the name of the memo file within the Calendar directory. The default is `memo'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MaxDisplayLines</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>controls the maximum number of text lines that can placed in the top half of the memo panel. The top hald will normally size to the number of lines in the diary file for the day, unless the number of lines exceed the value in this resource. This ensures that today's events do not dominate the memo panel. Default: 5 lines.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MaxStripHeight</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>controls the maximum height of a strip. A scroll bar will be added into the date part of the scrip of the contents are larger than this number. If unset, this defaults to the height of the screen. Default: unset.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Jan</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>Feb</strong> and so on. A short form of the month name - done this way because I doubt that writing with %3s works in all languages. Changing this resource means that the data file will no longer be compatible with <em>xcalendar .</em></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>Monday</strong> and so on. The <em>long</em> names of the days: Sunday, Monday etc. These are used in titles: the top level widget, the title of an edit window and the memo frame.</p>
