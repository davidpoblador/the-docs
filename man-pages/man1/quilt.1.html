        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Quilt is a tool to manage large sets of patches by keeping track of the changes each patch makes. Patches can be applied, un-applied, refreshed, etc. The key philosophical concept is that your primary output is patches.</p><p>With quilt, all work occurs within a single directory tree. Commands can be invoked from anywhere within the source tree. They are of the form <strong>quilt cmd</strong> similar to CVS, svn or git commands. They can be abbreviated as long as the specified part of the command is unique. All commands print some help text with <strong>quilt cmd -h.</strong></p><p>Quilt manages a stack of patches. Patches are applied incrementally on top of the base tree plus all preceding patches. They can be pushed on top of the stack (<strong>quilt push</strong>), and popped off the stack (<strong>quilt pop</strong>). Commands are available for querying the contents of the series file (<strong>quilt series</strong>, see below), the contents of the stack (<strong>quilt applied</strong>,<strong> quilt previous</strong>,<strong> quilt top</strong>), and the patches that are not applied at a particular moment (<strong>quilt next</strong>,<strong> quilt unapplied</strong>). By default, most commands apply to the topmost patch on the stack.</p><p>Patch files are located in the <em>patches</em> sub-directory of the source tree (see EXAMPLE OF WORKING TREE below). The <em>QUILT_PATCHES</em> environment variable can be used to override this location. When not found in the current directory, that subdirectory is searched recursively in the parent directories (this is similar to the way <em>git</em> searches for its configuration files). The <em>patches</em> directory may contain sub-directories. It may also be a symbolic link instead of a directory.</p><p>A file called <em>series</em> contains a list of patch file names that defines the order in which patches are applied. Unless there are means by which series files can be generated automatically, it is usually provided along with a set of patches. In this file, each patch file name is on a separate line. Patch files are identified by path names that are relative to the <em>patches</em> directory; patches may be in sub-directories below this directory. Lines in the series file that start with a hash character (#) are ignored. You can also add a comment after each patch file name, introduced by a space  followed by a hash character. When quilt adds, removes, or renames patches, it automatically updates the series file. Users of quilt can modify series files while some patches are applied, as long as the applied patches remain in their original order.</p><p>Different series files can be used to assemble patches in different ways, corresponding for example to different development branches.</p><p>Before a patch is applied (or ``pushed on the stack''), copies of all files the patch modifies are saved to the .pc/<em>patch</em> directory. The patch is added to the list of currently applied patches (.pc/applied-patches). Later when a patch is regenerated (<strong>quilt refresh</strong>), the backup copies in .pc/<em>patch</em> are compared with the current versions of the files in the source tree using GNU diff.</p><p>Documentation related to a patch can be put at the beginning of a patch file.  Quilt is careful to preserve all text that precedes the actual patch when doing a refresh. (This is limited to patches in unified format; see <strong>diff</strong> documentation).</p><p>The series file is looked up in the .pc directory, in the root of the source tree, and in the patches directory.  The first series file that is found is used. This may also be a symbolic link, or a file with multiple hard links. Usually, only one series file is used for a set of patches, so the patches sub-directory is a convenient location.</p><p>The .pc directory and its sub-directories cannot be relocated, but it can be a symbolic link. While patches are applied to the source tree, this directory is essential for many operations, including taking patches off the stack (<strong>quilt pop</strong>), and refreshing patches (<strong>quilt refresh</strong>). Files in the .pc directory are automatically removed when they are no longer needed, so there is no need to clean up manually.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>fork</strong> [new_name] 
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Fork the topmost patch.  Forking a patch means creating a verbatim copy of it under a new name, and use that new name instead of the original one in the current series.  This is useful when a patch has to be modified, but the original version of it should be preserved, e.g. because it is used in another series, or for the history.  A typical sequence of commands would be: fork, edit, refresh.</p><p>If new_name is missing, the name of the forked patch will be the current patch name, followed by `-2'.  If the patch name already ends in a dash-and-number, the number is further incremented (e.g., patch.diff, patch-2.diff, patch-3.diff).</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Generate a <a href="../man1/dot.1.html"><strong>dot</strong>(1)</a> directed graph showing the dependencies between applied patches. A patch depends on another patch if both touch the same file or, with the --lines option, if their modifications overlap. Unless otherwise specified, the graph includes all patches that the topmost patch depends on. When a patch name is specified, instead of the topmost patch, create a graph for the specified patch. The graph will include all other patches that this patch depends on, as well as all patches that depend on this patch.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
        --all
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Generate a graph including all applied patches and their dependencies. (Unapplied patches are not included.)</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
        --lines[=num]
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Compute dependencies by looking at the lines the patches modify. Unless a different num is specified, two lines of context are included.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
        --edge-labels=files
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Label graph edges with the file names that the adjacent patches modify.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
        -T ps
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Directly produce a PostScript output file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>grep</strong> [-h|options] {pattern} 
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Grep through the source files, recursively, skipping patches and quilt meta-information. If no filename argument is given, the whole source tree is searched. Please see the <a href="../man1/grep.1.html"><strong>grep</strong>(1)</a> manual page for options.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
        -h
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Print this help. The grep -h option can be passed after a double-dash (--). Search expressions that start with a dash can be passed after a second double-dash (-- --).</p>

    <strong>header</strong> [-a|-r|-e] [--backup] [--dep3] [--strip-diffstat] [--strip-trailing-whitespace] [patch] 
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Print or change the header of the topmost or specified patch.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
        -a, -r, -e
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Append to (-a) or replace (-r) the exiting patch header, or edit (-e) the header in $EDITOR. If none of these options is given, print the patch header.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">CONFIGURATION FILE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Upon startup, quilt evaluates the file .quiltrc in the user's home directory, or the file specified with the --quiltrc option.  This file is a regular bash script. Default options can be passed to any COMMAND by defining a QUILT_${COMMAND}_ARGS variable.  For example, QUILT_DIFF_ARGS="--color=auto" causes the output of quilt diff to be syntax colored when writing to a terminal.</p><p>In addition to that, quilt recognizes the following variables:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    EDITOR
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The program to run to edit files.  If it isn't redefined in the configuration file, $EDITOR as defined in the environment will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    LESS
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The arguments used to invoke the pager.  Inherits the existing value of $LESS if LESS is already set in the environment, otherwise defaults to "-FRSX".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    QUILT_DIFF_OPTS
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Additional options that quilt shall pass to GNU diff when generating patches. A useful setting for C source code is "-p", which causes GNU diff to show in the resulting patch which function a change is in.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    QUILT_PATCH_OPTS
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Additional options that quilt shall pass to GNU patch when applying patches.  For example, recent versions of GNU patch support the "--reject-format=unified" option for generating reject files in unified diff style (older patch versions used "--unified-reject-files" for that).</p><p>You may also want to add the "-E" option if you have issues with quilt not deleting empty files when you think it should. The documentation of GNU patch says that "normally this option is unnecessary", but when patch is in POSIX mode or if the patch format doesn't allow to distinguish empty files from deleted files, patch deletes empty files only if the -E option is given. Beware that when passing -E to patch, quilt will no longer be able to deal with empty files, which is why using -E is no longer the default.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    QUILT_DIFFSTAT_OPTS
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Additional options that quilt shall pass to diffstat when generating patch statistics. For example, "-f0" can be used for an alternative output format. Recent versions of diffstat also support alternative rounding methods ("-r1", "-r2").</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    QUILT_PATCHES
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The location of patch files, defaulting to "patches".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    QUILT_SERIES
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The name of the series file, defaulting to "series". Unless an absolute path is used, the search algorithm described above applies.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    QUILT_PATCHES_PREFIX
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to anything, quilt will prefix patch names it prints with their directory (QUILT_PATCHES).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    QUILT_NO_DIFF_INDEX
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>By default, quilt prepends an Index: line to the patches it generates. If this variable is set to anything, no line is prepended.  This is a shortcut to adding --no-index to both QUILT_DIFF_ARGS and QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    QUILT_NO_DIFF_TIMESTAMPS
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>By default, quilt includes timestamps in headers when generating patches. If this variable is set to anything, no timestamp will be included.  This is a shortcut to adding --no-timestamps to both QUILT_DIFF_ARGS and QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    QUILT_PAGER
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The pager quilt shall use for commands which produce paginated output. If unset, the values of GIT_PAGER or PAGER is used.  If none of these variables is set, "less -R" is used.  An empty value indicates that no pager should be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    QUILT_COLORS
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>By default, quilt uses its predefined color set in order to be more comprehensible when distiguishing various types of patches, eg. applied/unapplied, failed, etc.</p><p>To override one or more color settings, set the QUILT_COLORS variable in following syntax - colon (:) separated list of elements, each being of the form &lt;format name&gt;=&lt;foreground color&gt;[;&lt;background color&gt;]</p><p>Format names with their respective default values are listed below, along with their usage(s). Color codes(values) are standard bash coloring escape codes. See more at http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/colorizing.html#AEN20229</p>
