        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>minicom</strong> is a communication program which somewhat resembles the shareware program TELIX but is free with source code and runs under most Unices. Features include dialing directory with auto-redial, support for UUCP-style lock files on serial devices, a separate script language interpreter, capture to file, multiple users with individual configurations, and more.</p>
        </div>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">COMMAND-LINE</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-s, --setup</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>S</strong>etup. Root edits the system-wide defaults in /etc/minicom/minirc.dfl with this option. When it is used, minicom does <em>not</em> initialize, but puts you directly into the configuration menu. This is very handy if minicom refuses to start up because your system has changed, or for the first time you run minicom. For most systems, reasonable defaults are already compiled in.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-o, --noinit</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Do not initialize. Minicom will skip the initialization code.  This option is handy if you quit from minicom without resetting, and then want to restart a session. It is potentially dangerous though: no check for lock files etc. is made, so a normal user could interfere with things like UUCP... maybe this will be taken out later. For now it is assumed, that users who are given access to a modem are responsible enough for their actions.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-m, --metakey</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Override command-key with the Meta or ALT key. This is the default in 1.80 and it can also be configured in one of minicom's menus, but if you use different terminals all the time, of which some don't have a Meta or ALT key, it's handy to set the default command key to Ctrl-A and use this option when you have a keyboard supporting Meta or ALT keys. Minicom assumes that your Meta key sends the ESC prefix, not the other variant that sets the highest bit of the character.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-M, --metakey8</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Same as -m, but assumes that your Meta key sets the 8th bit of the character high (sends 128 + character code).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-z, --statline</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use terminal status line. This only works on terminals that support it and that have the relevant information in their <em>termcap</em> or <em>terminfo</em> database entry.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-l, --ansi</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>L</strong>iteral translation of characters with the high bit set. With this flag on, minicom will try to translate the IBM line characters to ASCII. Many PC-unix clones will display character correctly without translation (Linux in a special mode, Coherent and SCO).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-L, --iso</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Ditto but assume screen uses an ISO8859 character set.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-w, --wrap</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Turns line-wrap on at startup by default.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-H, --displayhex</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Turn on output in hex mode.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-a, --attrib=on/off</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>A</strong>ttribute usage. Some terminals, notably Televideo's, have rotten attribute handling (serial instead of parallel). By default, minicom uses '-a on', but if you are using such a terminal you can (must!)  supply the option '-a off'. The trailing 'on' or 'off' is needed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-t, --term=TERM</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>T</strong>erminal type. With this flag, you can override the environment TERM variable. This is handy for use in the MINICOM environment variable; one can create a special termcap entry for use with minicom on the console, that initializes the screen to raw mode so that in conjunction with the -l flag, the IBM line characters are displayed untranslated.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-c, --color=on/off</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>C</strong>olor usage. Some terminals (such as the Linux console) support color with the standard ANSI escape sequences. Because there is apparently no termcap support for color, these escape sequences are hard-coded into minicom. Therefore this option is off by default.  You can turn it on with '-c on'. This, and the '-m' option, are good candidates to put into the MINICOM environment variable.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-S, --script=SCRIPT</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>script</strong>. Run the named script at startup. So far, passing username and password to a startup script is not supported. If you also use the -d option to start dialing at startup, the -S script will be run BEFORE dialing the entries specified with -d.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-d, --dial=ENTRY</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>D</strong>ial an entry from the dialing directory on startup. You can specify an index number, but also a substring of the name of the entry. If you specify a name that has multiple entries in the directory, they are all tagged for dialing. You can also specify multiple names or index numbers by separating them with commas. The dialing will start from the first entry specified after all other program initialization procedures are completed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-p, --ptty=TTYP</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>P</strong>seudo terminal to use. This overrides the terminal port defined in the configuration files, but only if it is a pseudo TTY. The filename supplied must be of the form (/dev/)tty[p-z/][0-f], (/dev/)pts[p-z/][0-f] or (/dev/)pty[p-z/][0-f]. For example, /dev/ttyp1, pts/0 or /dev/ptyp2.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-C, --capturefile=FILE</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>filename</strong>. Open capture file at startup.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-F, --statlinefmt</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Format for the status line. The following format specifier are available:</p>
<pre>
   %H  Escape key for help screen.
   %V  Version string of minicom.
   %b  Information on connection, such as baud rate.
   %T  Terminal type.
   %C  Cursor mode.
   %D  Device path, possibly shorted to remaining available space.
   %t  Online time.
   %%  % character.
</pre>
<p>Example: "%H for help | %b | Minicom %V | %T | %C | %t"</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-b, --baudrate</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify the baud rate, overriding the value given in the configuration file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-D, --device</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify the device, overriding the value given in the configuration file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-R, --remotecharset</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify the character set of the remote system is using and convert it to the character set of the local side. Example might be 'latin1'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-7, --7bit</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>7bit mode for terminals which aren't 8bit capable. 8bit is default if the environment is configured for this via LANG or LC_ALL, 7bit otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-8, --8bit</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>8bit characters pass through without any modification.  'Continuous' means no locate/attribute control sequences are inserted without real change of locate/attribute. This mode is to display 8bit multi-byte characters such as Japanese. Not needed in every language with 8bit characters. (For example displaying Finnish text doesn't need this.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-h, --help</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Display help and exit.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>-v, --version</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Print the minicom version.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>When <strong>minicom</strong> starts, it first searches the MINICOM environment variable for command-line arguments, which can be over-ridden on the command line. Thus, if you have done</p><p>MINICOM=\[aq]-m -c on\[aq]</p><p>export MINICOM</p><p>or the equivalent, and start minicom, minicom will assume that your terminal <em>has</em> a Meta or &lt;ALT&gt; key and that color is supported.  If you then log in from a terminal without color support, and you have set MINICOM in your startup (.profile or equivalent) file, and don't want to re-set your environment variable, you can type 'minicom -c off' and run without color support for that session.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>configuration</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <em>configuration</em> argument is more interesting. Normally, minicom gets its defaults from a file called "minirc.dfl". If you however give an argument to minicom, it will try to get its defaults from a file called "minirc.<em>configuration</em>\|".  So it is possible to create multiple configuration files, for different ports, different users etc. Most sensible is to use device names, such as tty1, tty64, sio2 etc. If a user creates his own configuration file, it will show up in his home directory as ".minirc.dfl" or ".minirc.<em>configuration</em>\|".</p>

<p>Minicom is window based. To pop-up a window with the function you want, press Control-A (from now on, we will use C-A to mean Control-A), and then the function key (a-z or A-Z). By pressing C-A first and then 'z', a help screen comes up with a short summary of all commands. This escape key can be altered when minicom is configured (-s option or C-A O), but we'll stick to Control-A for now.</p><p>For every menu the next keys can be used:</p>

<p>The screen is divided into two portions: the upper 24 lines are the terminal-emulator screen. In this window, ANSI or VT100 escape sequences are interpreted.  If there is a line left at the bottom, a status line is placed there.  If this is not possible the status line will be showed every time you press C-A. On terminals that have a special status line that will be used if the termcap information is complete <em>and</em> the <strong>-k</strong> flag has been given.</p><p>Possible commands are listed next, in alphabetical order.</p>

You can add, delete or edit entries and move them up and down in the directory list. By choosing "dial" the phone numbers of the tagged entries, or if nothing is tagged, the number of the highlighted entry will be dialed. While the modem is dialing, you can press escape to cancel dialing. Any other key will close the dial window, but won't cancel the dialing itself. Your dialing directory will be saved into the file ".dialdir" in your home directory. You can scroll up and down with the arrow keys, but you can also scroll complete pages by pressing the PageUp or PageDown key.  If you don't have those, use Control-B (Backward) and Control-F (Forward). You can use the space bar to <strong>tag</strong> a number of entries and minicom will rotate trough this list if a connection can't be made. A '&gt;' symbol is drawn in the directory before the names of the tagged entries.</p><p>The "edit" menu speaks for itself, but I will discuss it briefly here.</p>

    <p><strong>B - Log connects and hangups</strong></p>

<p><strong>File Transfer Protocols</strong></p><p>Protocols defined here will show up when C-A s/r is pressed.  "Name" in the beginning of the line is the name that will show up in the menu. "Program" is the path to the protocol. "Name" after that defines if the program needs an argument, e.g. a file to be transmitted. U/D defines if this entry should show up in the upload or the download menu.  Fullscr defines if the program should run full screen, or that minicom will only show it's stderr in a window. IO-Red defines if minicom should attach the program's standard in and output to the modem port or not. "Multi" tells the filename selection window whether or not the protocol can send multiple files with one command. It has no effect on download protocols, and it is also ignored with upload protocols if you don't use the filename selection window. The old sz and rz are not full screen, and have IO-Red set. However, there are curses based versions of at least rz that do not want their stdin and stdout redirected, and run full screen.  All file transfer protocols are run with the UID of the user, and not with UID=root. '%l', '%f' and '%b' can be used on the command line as with kermit.  Within this menu you can also define if you want to use the filename selection window when prompted for files to upload, and if you like to be prompted for the download directory every time the automatic download is started. If you leave the download directory prompt disabled, the download directory defined in the file and directory menu is used.</p><p><strong>Serial port setup</strong></p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>A - Serial device</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>/dev/tty1 or /dev/ttyS1 for most people. /dev/cua&lt;n&gt; is still possible under GNU/Linux, but no longer recommended as these devices are obsolete and many systems with kernel 2.2.x or newer don't have them. Use /dev/ttyS&lt;n&gt; instead. You may also have /dev/modem as a symlink to the real device.</p><p>If you have modems connected to two or more serial ports, you may specify all of them here in a list separated by space, comma or semicolon. When Minicom starts, it checks the list until it finds an available modem and uses that one. (However, you can't specify different init strings to them... at least not yet.)</p><p>To use a UNIX socket for communication the device name must be prefixed with "unix#" following by the full path and the filename of the socket. Minicom will then try to connect to this socket as a client. As long as it cannot connect to the socket it stays 'offline'. As soon as the connection establishes, minicom goes 'online'. If the server closes the socket, minicom switches to 'offline' again.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>B - Lock file location</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>On most systems This should be /usr/spool/uucp. GNU/Linux systems use /var/lock. If this directory does not exist, minicom will not attempt to use lockfiles.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>C - Callin program</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If you have a uugetty or something on your serial port, it could be that you want a program to be run to switch the modem cq. port into dialin/dialout mode. This is the program to get into dialin mode.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>D - Callout program</strong></p>

<p>If one of the entries is left blank, it will not be used. So if you don't care about locking, and don't have a getty running on your modemline, entries B - D should be left blank.</p><p><strong>Modem and Dialing</strong></p><p>Here, the parameters for your modem are defined. I will not explain this further because the defaults are for generic Hayes modems, and should work always. This file is not a Hayes tutorial :-) The only things worth noticing are that control characters can be sent by prefixing them with a '^', in which '^^' means '^' itself, and the '&#92;' character must also be doubled as '&#92;&#92;', because backslash is used specially in the macro definitions.  Some options however, don't have much to do with the modem but more with the behaviour of minicom itself:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>M - Dial time</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The number of seconds before minicom times out if no connection is established.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>N - Delay before redial</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Minicom will redial if no connection was made, but it first waits some time.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>O - Number of tries</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Maximum number of times that minicom attempts to dial.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>P - Drop DTR time</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If you set this to 0, minicom hangs up by sending a Hayes-type hangup sequence. If you specify a non-zero value, the hangup will be done by dropping the DTR line. The value tells in seconds how long DTR will be kept down.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Q - Auto bps detect</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this is on, minicom tries to match the dialed party's speed. With most modern modems this is NOT desirable, since the modem buffers the data and converts the speed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>R - Modem has DCD line</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If your modem, and your O/S both support the DCD line (that goes 'high' when a connection is made) minicom will use it. When you have this option on, minicom will also NOT start dialing while you are already online.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>S - Status line shows DTE speed / line speed</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You can toggle the status line to show either the DTE speed (the speed which minicom uses to communicate with your modem) or the line speed (the speed that your modem uses on the line to communicate with the other modem). Notice that the line speed may change during the connection, but you will still only see the initial speed that the modems started the connection with. This is because the modem doesn't tell the program if the speed is changed. Also, to see the line speed, you need to have the modem set to show it in the connect string. Otherwise you will only see 0 as the line speed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>T - Multi-line untag</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You can toggle the feature to untag entries from the dialing directory when a connection is established to a multi-line BBS. All the tagged entries that have the same name are untagged.</p>

    <p>the 'Hot Key' that brings you into command mode. If this is set to 'ALT' or 'meta key', you can directly call commands by alt-key instead of HotKey-key.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>B - Backspace key sends</strong></p>

  <dd>
    <p>The number of lines to keep in the history buffer (for backscrolling).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>L - Macros file</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>is the full path to the file that holds macros. Macros allow you to define a string to be sent when you press a certain key. In minicom, you may define F1 through F10 to send up to 256 characters [this is set at compile time]. The filename you specify is verified as soon as you hit ENTER. If you do not have permissions to create the specified file, an error message will so indicate and you will be forced to re-edit the filename. If you are permitted to create the file, minicom checks to see if it already exists. If so, it assumes it's a macro file and reads it in. If it isn't, well, it's your problem :-) If the file does not exist, the filename is accepted.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>M - Edit Macros</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>opens up a new window which allows you to edit the F1 through F10 macros.</p>

    <p><strong>N - Macros enabled</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>- Yes or No. If macros are disabled, the F1-F10 keys will just send the VT100/VT220 function key escape sequences.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>O - Character conversion</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The active conversion table filename is shown here. If you can see no name, no conversion is active. Pressing O, you will see the conversion table edit menu.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Edit Macros</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Here, the macros for F1 through F10 are defined. The bottom of the window shows a legend of character combinations that have special meaning. They allow you to enter special control characters with plain text by prefixing them with a '^', in which '^^' means '^' itself. You can send a 1 second delay with the '^~' code. This is useful when you are trying to login after ftp'ing or telnet'ing somewhere. You can also include your current username and password from the phone directory in the macros with '&#92;u' and '&#92;p', respectively. If you need the backslash character in the macro, write it doubled as '&#92;&#92;'. To edit a macro, press the number (or letter for F10) and you will be moved to the end of the macro. When editing the line, you may use the left & right arrows, Home & End keys, Delete & BackSpace, and ESC and RETURN.  ESC cancels any changes made while ENTER accepts the changes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Character conversion</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Here you can edit the character conversion table. If you are not an American, you know that in many languages there are characters that are not included in the ASCII character set, and in the old times they may have replaced some less important characters in ASCII and now they are often represented with character codes above 127. AND there are various different ways to represent them. This is where you may edit conversion tables for systems that use a character set different from the one on your computer.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>A - Load table</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You probably guessed it. This command loads a table from the disk. You are asked a file name for the table. Predefined tables .mciso, .mcpc8 and .mcsf7 should be included with the program. Table .mciso does no conversion, .mcpc8 is to be used for connections with systems that use the 8-bit pc character set, and .mcsf7 is for compatibility with the systems that uses the good old 7-bit coding to replace the characters {|}[]nbsp;with the diacritical characters used in Finnish and Swedish.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>B - Save table</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This one saves the active table on the filename you specify.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>C - edit char</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is where you can make your own modifications to the existing table. First you are asked the character value (in decimal) whose conversion you want to change. Next you'll say which character you want to see on your screen when that character comes from the outside world. And then you'll be asked what you want to be sent out when you enter that character from your keyboard.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>D - next screen</strong></p>

  <dd>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>E - prev screen</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Yeah, you probably noticed that this screen shows you what kind of conversions are active. The screen just is (usually) too small to show the whole table at once in an easy-to-understand format. This is how you can scroll the table left and right.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>F - convert capture</strong></p>

<p>The status line has several indicators, that speak for themselves. The mysterious APP or NOR indicator probably needs explanation. The VT100 cursor keys can be in two modes: applications mode and cursor mode. This is controlled by an escape sequence. If you find that the cursor keys do not work in, say, vi when you're logged in using minicom then you can see with this indicator whether the cursor keys are in applications or cursor mode. You can toggle the two with the C-A I key. If the cursor keys then work, it's probably an error in the remote system's termcap initialization strings (is).</p>

Without the -9 parameter, minicom first hangs up before exiting.</p><p>Since a lot of escape sequences begin with ESC (Arrow up is ESC [ A), Minicom does not know if the escape character it gets is you pressing the escape key, or part of a sequence.</p><p>An old version of Minicom, V1.2, solved this in a rather crude way: to get the escape key, you had to press it <em>twice</em>.</p><p>As of release 1.3 this has bettered a little: now a 1-second timeout is builtin, like in vi. For systems that have the select() system call the timeout is 0.5 seconds. And... surprise: a special Linux-dependent <strong>hack</strong> :-) was added.
