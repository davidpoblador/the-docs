        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>cfed</strong> is the Crimson Fields level compiler.</p><p>It creates a <em>*.lev</em> file out of a source file <em>*.src</em>. You can use any standard text editor to create the level source files (for the syntax of those files, see the section called &ldquo;FILE FORMAT&rdquo; below). <strong>cfed</strong> reads the input file and creates the level file. If the name of the ouput file is not given on the command line, it is created in the same location as the source file with the .src suffix substituted by .lev.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">FILE FORMAT</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>A level source file consists of sections. A section is started by the section name in square brackets, i.e. the line</p><p>[unit]</p><p>starts a unit section. Lines in a section are usually composed like this:</p><p>qualifier = value</p><p>The only exceptions to this are the <em>map</em> and <em>messages</em> sections. Lines starting with # are considered comments. The following sections exist:</p><h3>mission</h3>
<p>This section defines some global mission parameters like map size or the graphics set to use. The mission section is mandatory and must appear before the map section in the file. Valid qualifiers are</p><p>name</p><p>index of a message containing the mission title. This name will be used when presenting the list of available maps to the player. (maximum length 30 characters, mandatory)</p><p>mapwidth</p><p>[10-200] (mandatory)</p><p>mapheight</p><p>[10-200] (mandatory)</p><p>nextmap</p><p>the name of another map (without path and file ending). After the current map has been completed, this new map will be loaded automatically. This tag is only valid for <em>campaign</em> maps.</p><p>info</p><p>index of the information message that is to be shown when a player requests level information. This message can contain the level name, author, revision, etc.</p><p>campaign</p><p>indicates whether the map is part of a campaign [0|1]. Default is 0 (not part of a campaign). See also <em>campaignname</em> and <em>campaigninfo</em>.</p><p>campaignname</p><p>index of the campaign name. It should be set only when the map actually is the first of a campaign. See also <em>campaign</em> and <em>campaigninfo</em>. (mandatory and valid only for the introductory map of a campaign)</p><p>campaigninfo</p><p>index of the information message for the campaign. This info is displayed when starting a new campaign and should contain a short outline of the background story. It is useful only when the map actually is the first of a campaign. See also <em>campaign</em> and <em>campaignname</em>.</p><p>skirmish</p><p>indicates whether the map can be played in skirmish mode [0|1]. Default is 1 (true).</p><p>players</p><p>selects whether the map is intended for play against another human being (2) or against the computer (1). This is for informational purposes only and defaults to 2.</p><p>music</p><p>name of a soundtrack (either MIDI or Ogg Vorbis) excluding the file type suffix to be played during this map. If the setting is missing, the default track for Crimson Fields will be played.</p><p>tileset</p><p>tileset file to be used. A tileset contains the map graphics and terrain definitions. The filename must be given without the <em>.tiles</em> suffix. If omitted, the tile set defaults to 'default'.</p><p>unitset</p><p>unit set file to be used. A unit set contains the unit graphics and definitions. The filename must be given without the <em>.units</em> suffix. If omitted, the unit set defaults to 'default'.</p>
<h3>map</h3>
<p>The map section defines the actual map layout. It is a rectangle of the size specified in the <em>mission</em> section, consisting of various symbols which describe a certain map tile type. The map section is mandatory and may not contain comments. The following symbols exist.</p><p>.</p><p>plains</p><p>*</p><p>forest</p><p>%</p><p>mountains</p><p>=</p><p>shallow water</p><p>~</p><p>water</p><p>-</p><p>deep water</p><p>#</p><p>swamp</p><p>"</p><p>cliff</p><p>0</p><p>headquarters, neutral entrance, east</p><p>1</p><p>headquarters, yellow entrance, east</p><p>2</p><p>headquarters, blue entrance, east</p><p>3</p><p>depot, neutral entrance, north</p><p>4</p><p>depot, yellow entrance, north</p><p>5</p><p>depot, blue entrance, north</p><p>6</p><p>factory, neutral entrance, north</p><p>7</p><p>factory, yellow entrance, north</p><p>8</p><p>factory, blue entrance, north</p><p>9</p><p>factory, neutral entrance, east</p><p>J</p><p>factory, yellow entrance, east</p><p>L</p><p>factory, blue entrance, east</p><p>A</p><p>city, yellow</p><p>B</p><p>city, blue</p><p>C</p><p>city, neutral</p><p>D</p><p>headquarters, yellow entrance, west</p><p>E</p><p>headquarters, blue entrance, west</p><p>F</p><p>headquarters, neutral entrance, west</p><p>G</p><p>headquarters, yellow entrance, north</p><p>H</p><p>headquarters, blue entrance, north</p><p>I</p><p>headquarters, neutral entrance, north</p><p>&gt;</p><p>headquarters, east</p><p>&lt;</p><p>headquarters, west</p><p>^</p><p>headquarters, north</p><p>v</p><p>headquarters, south</p><p>&#92;</p><p>road, se-nw</p><p>|</p><p>road, s-n</p><p>/</p><p>road, sw-ne</p><p>y</p><p>road, sw-n-ne</p><p>Y</p><p>road, se-n-nw</p><p>X</p><p>road, s-se-nw-n</p><p>x</p><p>road, s-sw-n-ne</p><p>o</p><p>road, sw-nw-ne-se</p><p>k</p><p>road, sw-s-ne</p><p>K</p><p>road, s-se-nw</p><p>(</p><p>road, n-se</p><p>)</p><p>road, n-sw</p><p>]</p><p>road, nw-s</p><p>[</p><p>road, ne-s</p><p>n</p><p>road, sw-se</p><p>u</p><p>road, nw-ne</p><p>T</p><p>road, n-s-se</p><p>U</p><p>road, n-s-sw</p><p>V</p><p>road, n-s-ne</p><p>W</p><p>road, n-s-nw</p><p>!</p><p>bridge, n-s</p><p>`</p><p>bridge, sw-ne</p><p>\'</p><p>bridge, se-nw</p><p>a</p><p>fence, se-nw end</p><p>b</p><p>fence, nw-se end</p><p>c</p><p>fence, ne-sw end</p><p>d</p><p>fence, sw-ne end</p><p>e</p><p>fence, n-s</p><p>f</p><p>fence, sw-ne</p><p>g</p><p>fence, nw-se</p><p>h</p><p>fence, nw-s</p><p>i</p><p>fence, ne-s</p><p>j</p><p>fence, sw-n</p><p>l</p><p>fence, se-n</p><p>m</p><p>fence, nw-ne</p><p>p</p><p>fence, sw-se</p><p>There is also an alternative format. If the section is called <em>map-raw</em> instead, the map is defined by giving the hexagon identifiers directly, using the comma as a tile separator. This approach requires intimate knowledge of the tileset used and may break the map if the tileset changes. The format has been created because there are now more tiles than can be represented with single ASCII characters.</p>
<h3>player</h3>
<p>This can be used to set some player definitions. There may be a maximum of two player sections in a file. The first section encountered corresponds to the first player, the next to the second. Valid qualifiers are</p><p>name</p><p>index of a message containing the player name (mandatory, maximum length 20 characters)</p><p>briefing</p><p>index of the player's briefing message. The briefing can be reviewed during the game by choosing the Briefing item from the Game Menu. It is also recommended to create a <em>message</em> event to tell the players about their objectives on the first turn (see <em>event</em> and <em>messages</em> sections below). If omitted defaults to -1, meaning that no briefing is available.</p><p>fcolor</p><p>foreground color to use for this player in the format <em>r,g,b</em>, e.g. 255,0,0 for red. The default player colors match the default unit set, but different sets may use different color schemes (also see <em>bcolor</em>).</p><p>bcolor</p><p>background color to use for this player in the format <em>r,g,b</em>, e.g. 0,0,255 for blue. The default player colors match the default unit set, but different sets may use different color schemes (also see <em>fcolor</em>).</p>
<h3>unit</h3>
<p>Each of these sections creates a unit on the map. Loaded transporter units must be specified before any units they carry. Valid qualifiers for units are</p><p>pos</p><p>location of the unit on the map. If there is a building at the given location, the unit will be put in. It is also possible to let units begin inside a transport. In that case you have to make sure, however, that in the level file the transport is declared before the carried unit [x/y]. (mandatory)</p><p>id</p><p>unique unit identifier [0-10000]. (mandatory)</p><p>type</p><p>unit type definition to use for this unit. Known definitions for the default unit set are <em>Infantry</em>, <em>Medium Tanks</em>, <em>Heavy Tanks</em>, <em>Anti-Aircraft Tanks</em>, <em>Anti-Aircraft Guns</em>, <em>Artillery</em>, <em>Mines</em>, <em>Patrol Boats</em>, <em>Fighter Squadron</em>, <em>Personnel Carriers</em>, <em>Troopships</em>, <em>Transport Planes</em>, <em>Scouts</em>, <em>Interceptors</em>, <em>Bunkers</em>, <em>Torpedo Boats</em>, <em>Bomber Wing</em>, <em>Hovercraft</em>, <em>Gunships</em>, <em>Troop Train</em>, <em>Rail Guns</em>, <em>Armoured Train</em>, <em>Submarines</em>, and <em>Aircraft Carriers</em>. (mandatory)</p><p>player</p><p>unit controller [1|2]. (mandatory)</p><p>size</p><p>number of vehicles for this unit [1-6]. Defaults to 6 (undamaged).</p><p>xp</p><p>experience level this unit starts at [0-6]. Defaults to 0 (Rookie, no experience).</p><p>face</p><p>direction the unit is heading [0-5]. Directions are numbered clockwise from North (0) to Northwest (5). Defaults are North (0) for units controlled by player 1, and South (3) for the second player.</p><p>crystals</p><p>amount of crystals the unit carries. This may only be given for transports and defaults to 0.</p>
<h3>building</h3>
<p>A building section is required to actually create a building (sometimes also called a shop) on the map that units can enter. This is not automatically done by placing the symbol for a building entrance in the map section.</p><p>pos</p><p>location of the building entrance on the map [x/y]. (mandatory)</p><p>id</p><p>unique building identifier [0-10000]. (mandatory)</p><p>player</p><p>building controller [1|2|0]. Units starting in unaligned buildings are automatically tagged unaligned as well. (mandatory)</p><p>type</p><p>type of building. Units can be repaired in buildings of type <em>Workshop</em>. New units can be produced in buildings of type <em>Factory</em>. A building may have multiple types. Defaults to <em>Depot</em>, meaning no special attributes. In addition to these attributes, a shop which produces crystals is (automatically) called a <em>Mine</em>.</p><p>name</p><p>index of a message containing the shop name (mandatory, maximum length 30 characters)</p><p>mining</p><p>amount of crystals produced each turn [0-1000]. Defaults to 0. If given, implies type <em>Mine</em>.</p><p>capacity</p><p>maximum amount of crystals [0-10000]. Defaults to 1000.</p><p>crystals</p><p>amount of crystals in stock [0-capacity]. Defaults to 0.</p><p>factory</p><p>name of a unit type definition that can be built here. If given, implies type = factory. Multiple <em>factory</em> lines may be given for a shop.</p><p>minweight</p><p>weight of the smallest unit allowed to enter the building [0-99]. Defaults to 0.</p><p>maxweight</p><p>weight of the heaviest unit allowed to enter the building [0-99]. Defaults to 99.</p>
<h3>event</h3>
<p>Events provide a way to interact with players during a game. They can cause actions like points being awarded or messages being displayed under certain conditions. The event type defines what happens, the event trigger controls when (or if) the event is executed.</p><p><strong>Event Types</strong></p><p>configure</p><p>dynamically change the setting for various internal strings during the course of a game, e.g. the players' mission briefings.</p><p>createunit</p><p>create a unit somewhere on the map.</p><p>destroyunit</p><p>destroy a unit and remove it from the map.</p><p>manipulateevent</p><p>modify event internals. Currently this can be used to dynamically enable or disable an event.</p><p>message</p><p>display a message.</p><p>mining</p><p>set the amount of crystals for a building.</p><p>research</p><p>make a new unit type available for production in a factory, or remove it from the list of available units.</p><p>score</p><p>award points to a player.</p><p>sethex</p><p>change a tile on the map.</p><p>settimer</p><p>dynamically adjust the <em>timer</em> trigger of another event.</p><p><strong>Event Triggers</strong></p><p>handicap</p><p>the event is executed if the set handicap matches the current game settings. Usually such an event is triggered immediately on the first turn or not at all. You can, however, combine multiple events (e.g. a <em>handicap</em> and a <em>timer</em> trigger) to change the default behaviour.</p><p>havebuilding</p><p>the event is executed when the player controls a certain building at a specified time.</p><p>havecrystals</p><p>the event is executed when the player owns a certain amount of crystals.</p><p>haveunit</p><p>the event is executed when the player controls a certain unit at a specified time.</p><p>timer</p><p>the event is unconditionally executed at the specified time.</p><p>unitdestroyed</p><p>the event is executed when a specified unit is destroyed or captured by the enemy.</p><p>unitposition</p><p>the event is executed when a specified unit ends its move on a certain target hex.</p><p>The following list contains generic qualifiers which are valid for all event types.</p><p><strong>Qualifiers</strong></p><p>id</p><p>unique event identifier [0-200]. (mandatory)</p><p>type</p><p>event type (mandatory, see below).</p><p>trigger</p><p>event trigger (mandatory). This describes the circumstances under which the event is executed (see below).</p><p>message</p><p>index of a message to be displayed when the event occurs.</p><p>title</p><p>title of the message window. Only useful when a message is shown.</p><p>depend</p><p>identifier of another event. This makes the current event depend on the given event. Prior to event execution, the trigger conditions for both events are checked, and the event is activated only if both checks are successful. Mutual, circular, and transitive dependencies are supported.</p><p>discard</p><p>identifier of another event. When the current event is executed, the given event is discarded from the event stack and removed from the mission.</p><p>flags</p><p>event flags. Currently, the only available flag is 1 (disable). A disabled event will never execute, regardless of the trigger conditions.</p><p>In addition there are special qualifiers which can only be used with certain event types or triggers. All of these are mandatory if nothing else is stated.</p><p>action (manipulateevent, mining, research)</p><p>For <em>manipulateevent</em> this defines how to handle the specified flags. A value of 0 will set, 1 will clear, and 2 will toggle the flags.</p><p>For <em>mining</em> 0 will set the crystal storage to an absolute amount, 1 will modify the current amount by the given number, 2 will set the mining rate, i.e. the amount mined each turn, and 3 will change the current mining rate by the given value. Minimum mining rate is 0, maximum is 200.</p><p>For <em>research</em> 0 allows and 1 disallows producing the specified unit type. Default is 0.</p><p>building (mining, research)</p><p>Identifier of the building referenced in the event.</p><p>crystals (mining)</p><p>Amount of crystals. The <em>action</em> flag controls how this number is actually interpreted.</p><p>eflags (manipulateevent)</p><p>Event flags to be modified. Currently the only legal value for this is 1, the disable flag, which can be used to deactivate an event. Disabled events won't be triggered even if their trigger conditions are met.</p><p>event (manipulateevent, settimer)</p><p>Identifier of the event to be modified.</p><p>face (createunit)</p><p>Direction the created unit faces [0-5]. Directions are numbered clockwise from North (0) to Northwest (5). Optional, defaults to 0.</p><p>offset (settimer)</p><p>Offset to use when adjusting the timer. 0 means absolute, i.e. set the trigger <em>ttime</em> to the value of <em>time</em>. 1 means execution time, i.e. set it to the value of <em>time</em> plus the current time index when executing the event. 2 means current trigger configuration, i.e. add the <em>time</em> to the trigger <em>ttime</em>. Note that if the target event is disabled, <em>settimer</em> will automatically enable it.</p><p>othermsg (score)</p><p>For score events, one often wants to show a message not only to the player who benefits from the event but also to his opponent. Instead of creating a separate <em>message</em> event with inverted trigger conditions you can use this qualifier and <em>othertitle</em> to do just that (optional).</p><p>othertitle (score)</p><p>Index of the message title for the other player (optional, see <em>othermsg</em>)</p><p>owner (destroyunit)</p><p>Only destroy the unit if it is controlled by this player [1,2,-1]. Optional, default is any player (-1).</p><p>pos (createunit)</p><p>hex to create the unit on. The unit will only be created if the target hex is empty at creation time or there is a shop or a valid transporter which is controlled by the player for whom the event is set up [x/y].</p><p>pos (destroyunit)</p><p>hex to destroy the unit on [x/y]. The <em>pos</em> parameter can only be used if <em>unit</em> is -1.</p><p>pos (message)</p><p>hex to focus the display on when showing the message [x/y] (optional). If this parameter is absent the game will try to guess a suitable hex from the trigger data, e.g. a <em>havebuilding</em> trigger will cause it to use the shop location.</p><p>pos (sethex)</p><p>hex to change. If the hex is occupied by a unit at the time the event is executed it may end up on terrain it would not normally be able to enter [x/y].</p><p>setting (configure)</p><p>Name of the setting you wish to change. Valid names are <em>briefing1</em> for the briefing for the first player, <em>briefing2</em> for the objectives for the second player, and <em>nextmap</em> for the next mission in a campaign.</p><p>size (createunit)</p><p>Unit group size [1-6]. Optional, defaults to 6.</p><p>success (score)</p><p>Amount of success points the player receives when the event occurs. Any player with a success score of 100 or more wins the game.</p><p>unit (createunit, research)</p><p>Name of a unit type specification to build or make available, respectively.</p><p>unit (destroyunit)</p><p>Identifier of the unit to be destroyed. Set to -1 and configure the <em>pos</em> parameter to destroy a unit in a specified location instead.</p><p>tbuilding (havebuilding, havecrystals)</p><p>Identifier of the building to be controlled.

For the <em>unitdestroyed</em> trigger it is only required if <em>tunit</em> is -1. In this case you can select the player whose units have to be destroyed to activate the event. This setting may be omitted and defaults to the player not owning the event, while for <em>havecrystals</em> and <em>unitposition</em> the default is the player owning the event.

For <em>timer</em> the event will always be executed at this time. Time calculation starts with 0 at the start of a mission and increases by 1 each time the players change. The movement phase of player 2 on turn 10 is at time index 19 ((turn - 1) * 2 + (player - 1)), for example. (mandatory only for <em>timer</em>.

For <em>unitdestroyed</em> and <em>unitposition</em> this may take a value of -1 which will activate the event when all enemy units have been destroyed or any unit controlled by this player has reached the destination hex, respectively.

The Great Example
Revision 6 (16-08-2004)
by Jens Granseuer &lt;jensgr@gmx.net&gt;
%
This is a nice introductory message, so that player 1 knows what he is expected to do. Word wraps are done automatically, so don't include line breaks if you don't want them. So, Player 1, let's take them apart:

Either conquer the enemy headquarters or destroy all their troops.
%
This should present the situation to player 2.

You are being attacked. Defend yourself. The attack is considered repelled if you gain control of the enemy headquarters or the entire attacking army is no more.
%
This is the success message for conquering the enemy headquarters.
Congratulations!
%
Hip! Hip! Hurrah!
