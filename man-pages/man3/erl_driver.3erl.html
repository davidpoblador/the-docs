<p>An Erlang driver is a library containing a set of native driver callback functions that the Erlang VM calls when certain events occur. There may be multiple instances of a driver, each instance is associated with an Erlang port.</p><p><strong></strong> Warning:</p><p><em>Use this functionality with extreme care!</em></p><p>A driver callback is executed as a direct extension of the native code of the VM. Execution is not made in a safe environment. The VM can <em>not</em> provide the same services as provided when executing Erlang code, such as preemptive scheduling or memory protection. If the driver callback function doesn't behave well, the whole VM will misbehave.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>

    <p>A driver callback that crash will crash the whole VM.</p>

    <p>An erroneously implemented driver callback might cause a VM internal state inconsistency which may cause a crash of the VM, or miscellaneous misbehaviors of the VM at any point after the call to the driver callback.</p>

    <p>A driver callback that do <strong>lengthy work</strong> before returning will degrade responsiveness of the VM, and may cause miscellaneous strange behaviors. Such strange behaviors include, but are not limited to, extreme memory usage, and bad load balancing between schedulers. Strange behaviors that might occur due to lengthy work may also vary between OTP releases.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>As of erts version 5.5.3 the driver interface has been extended (see <strong>extended marker</strong>). The extended interface introduce <strong>version management</strong>, the possibility to pass capability flags (see <strong>driver flags</strong>) to the runtime system at driver initialization, and some new driver API functions.</p><p><strong></strong> Note:</p><p>As of erts version 5.9 old drivers have to be recompiled and have to use the extended interface. They also have to be adjusted to the <strong>64-bit capable driver interface. </strong></p><p>The driver calls back to the emulator, using the API functions declared in <em>erl_driver.h</em>. They are used for outputting data from the driver, using timers, etc.</p><p>Each driver instance is associated with a port. Every port has a port owner process. Communication with the port is normally done through the port owner process. Most of the functions take the <em>port</em> handle as an argument. This identifies the driver instance. Note that this port handle must be stored by the driver, it is not given when the driver is called from the emulator (see <strong>driver_entry</strong>).</p><p>Some of the functions take a parameter of type <em>ErlDrvBinary</em>, a driver binary. It should be both allocated and freed by the caller. Using a binary directly avoids one extra copying of data.</p><p>Many of the output functions have a "header buffer", with <em>hbuf</em> and <em>hlen</em> parameters. This buffer is sent as a list before the binary (or list, depending on port mode) that is sent. This is convenient when matching on messages received from the port. (Although in the latest versions of Erlang, there is the binary syntax, that enables you to match on the beginning of a binary.)</p><p>In the runtime system with SMP support, drivers are locked either on driver level or port level (driver instance level). By default driver level locking will be used, i.e., only one emulator thread will execute code in the driver at a time. If port level locking is used, multiple emulator threads may execute code in the driver at the same time. There will only be one thread at a time calling driver call-backs corresponding to the same port, though. In order to enable port level locking set the <em>ERL_DRV_FLAG_USE_PORT_LOCKING</em> <strong>driver flag</strong> in the <strong>driver_entry</strong> used by the driver. When port level locking is used it is the responsibility of the driver writer to synchronize all accesses to data shared by the ports (driver instances).</p><p>Most drivers written before the runtime system with SMP support existed will be able to run in the runtime system with SMP support without being rewritten if driver level locking is used.</p><p><strong></strong> Note:</p><p>It is assumed that drivers do not access other drivers. If drivers should access each other they have to provide their own mechanism for thread safe synchronization. Such "inter driver communication" is strongly discouraged.</p><p>Previously, in the runtime system without SMP support, specific driver call-backs were always called from the same thread. This is <em>not</em> the case in the runtime system with SMP support. Regardless of locking scheme used, calls to driver call-backs may be made from different threads, e.g., two consecutive calls to exactly the same call-back for exactly the same port may be made from two different threads. This will for <em>most</em> drivers not be a problem, but it might. Drivers that depend on all call-backs being called in the same thread, <em>have</em> to be rewritten before being used in the runtime system with SMP support.</p><p><strong></strong> Note:</p><p>Regardless of locking scheme used, calls to driver call-backs may be made from different threads.</p><p>Most functions in this API are <em>not</em> thread-safe, i.e., they may <em>not</em> be called from an arbitrary thread. Functions that are not documented as thread-safe may only be called from driver call-backs or function calls descending from a driver call-back call. Note that driver call-backs may be called from different threads. This, however, is not a problem for any function in this API, since the emulator has control over these threads.</p><p><strong></strong> Warning:</p><p>Functions not explicitly documented as thread safe are <em>not</em> thread safe. Also note that some functions are <em>only</em> thread safe when used in a runtime system with SMP support.</p><p>A function not explicitly documented as thread safe may at some point in time have a thread safe implementation in the runtime system. Such an implementation may however change to a thread <em>unsafe</em> implementation at any time <em>without any notice</em> at all.</p><p><em>Only use functions explicitly documented as thread safe from arbitrary threads.</em></p><p>As mentioned in the <strong>warning</strong> text at the beginning of this document it is of vital importance that a driver callback does return relatively fast. It is hard to give an exact maximum amount of time that a driver callback is allowed to work, but as a rule of thumb a well behaving driver callback should return before a millisecond has passed. This can be achieved using different approaches. If you have full control over the code that are to execute in the driver callback, the best approach is to divide the work into multiple chunks of work and trigger multiple calls to the <strong>timeout callback</strong> using zero timeouts. The <strong></strong><em>erl_drv_consume_timeslice()</em> function can be useful in order to determine when to trigger such timeout callback calls. It might, however, not always be possible to implement it this way, e.g. when calling third party libraries. In this case you typically want to dispatch the work to another thread. Information about thread primitives can be found below.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">FUNCTIONALITY</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>All functions that a driver needs to do with Erlang are performed through driver API functions. There are functions for the following functionality:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Timer functions: Timer functions are used to control the timer that a driver may use. The timer will have the emulator call the <strong>timeout</strong> entry function after a specified time. Only one timer is available for each driver instance.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Queue handling: Every driver instance has an associated queue. This queue is a <em>SysIOVec</em> that works as a buffer. It's mostly used for the driver to buffer data that should be written to a device, it is a byte stream. If the port owner process closes the driver, and the queue is not empty, the driver will not be closed. This enables the driver to flush its buffers before closing.</p><p>The queue can be manipulated from arbitrary threads if a port data lock is used. See documentation of the <strong>ErlDrvPDL</strong> type for more information.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Output functions: With the output functions, the driver sends data back to the emulator. They will be received as messages by the port owner process, see <em>open_port/2</em>. The vector function and the function taking a driver binary are faster, because they avoid copying the data buffer. There is also a fast way of sending terms from the driver, without going through the binary term format.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Failure: The driver can exit and signal errors up to Erlang. This is only for severe errors, when the driver can't possibly keep open.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Asynchronous calls: The latest Erlang versions (R7B and later) has provision for asynchronous function calls, using a thread pool provided by Erlang. There is also a select call, that can be used for asynchronous drivers.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>Multi-threading</strong>: A POSIX thread like API for multi-threading is provided. The Erlang driver thread API only provide a subset of the functionality provided by the POSIX thread API. The subset provided is more or less the basic functionality needed for multi-threaded programming:</p>

    <p><strong>Condition variables</strong></p>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>

  <dd>
    <p><strong>Read/Write locks</strong></p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>*</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>Thread specific data</strong></p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The Erlang driver thread API can be used in conjunction with the POSIX thread API on UN-ices and with the Windows native thread API on Windows. The Erlang driver thread API has the advantage of being portable, but there might exist situations where you want to use functionality from the POSIX thread API or the Windows native thread API.</p><p>The Erlang driver thread API only returns error codes when it is reasonable to recover from an error condition. If it isn't reasonable to recover from an error condition, the whole runtime system is terminated. For example, if a create mutex operation fails, an error code is returned, but if a lock operation on a mutex fails, the whole runtime system is terminated.</p><p>Note that there exists no "condition variable wait with timeout" in the Erlang driver thread API. This is due to issues with <em>pthread_cond_timedwait()</em>. When the system clock suddenly is changed, it isn't always guaranteed that you will wake up from the call as expected. An Erlang runtime system has to be able to cope with sudden changes of the system clock. Therefore, we have omitted it from the Erlang driver thread API. In the Erlang driver case, timeouts can and should be handled with the timer functionality of the Erlang driver API.</p><p>In order for the Erlang driver thread API to function, thread support has to be enabled in the runtime system. An Erlang driver can check if thread support is enabled by use of <strong>driver_system_info()</strong>. Note that some functions in the Erlang driver API are thread-safe only when the runtime system has SMP support, also this information can be retrieved via <strong>driver_system_info()</strong>. Also note that a lot of functions in the Erlang driver API are <em>not</em> thread-safe regardless of whether SMP support is enabled or not. If a function isn't documented as thread-safe it is <em>not</em> thread-safe.</p><p><em>NOTE</em>: When executing in an emulator thread, it is <em>very important</em> that you unlock <em>all</em> locks you have locked before letting the thread out of your control; otherwise, you are <em>very likely</em> to deadlock the whole emulator. If you need to use thread specific data in an emulator thread, only have the thread specific data set while the thread is under your control, and clear the thread specific data before you let the thread out of your control.</p><p>In the future there will probably be debug functionality integrated with the Erlang driver thread API. All functions that create entities take a <em>name</em> argument. Currently the <em>name</em> argument is unused, but it will be used when the debug functionality has been implemented. If you name all entities created well, the debug functionality will be able to give you better error reports.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Adding / removing drivers: A driver can add and later remove drivers.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Monitoring processes: A driver can monitor a process that does not own a port.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>Version management</strong>: Version management is enabled for drivers that have set the <strong>extended_marker</strong> field of their <strong>driver_entry</strong> to <em>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER</em>. <em>erl_driver.h</em> defines <em>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER</em>, <em>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION</em>, and <em>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION</em>. <em>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION</em> will be incremented when driver incompatible changes are made to the Erlang runtime system. Normally it will suffice to recompile drivers when the <em>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION</em> has changed, but it could, under rare circumstances, mean that drivers have to be slightly modified. If so, this will of course be documented. <em>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION</em> will be incremented when new features are added. The runtime system uses the minor version of the driver to determine what features to use. The runtime system will normally refuse to load a driver if the major versions differ, or if the major versions are equal and the minor version used by the driver is greater than the one used by the runtime system. Old drivers with lower major versions will however be allowed after a bump of the major version during a transition period of two major releases. Such old drivers might however fail if deprecated features are used.</p><p>The emulator will refuse to load a driver that does not use the extended driver interface, to allow for 64-bit capable drivers, since incompatible type changes for the callbacks <strong>output</strong>, <strong>control</strong> and <strong>call</strong> were introduced in release R15B. A driver written with the old types would compile with warnings and when called return garbage sizes to the emulator causing it to read random memory and create huge incorrect result blobs.</p><p>Therefore it is not enough to just recompile drivers written with version management for pre-R15B types; the types have to be changed in the driver suggesting other rewrites especially regarding size variables. Investigate all warnings when recompiling!</p><p>Also, the API driver functions <em>driver_output*</em>, <em>driver_vec_to_buf</em>, <em>driver_alloc/realloc*</em> and the <em>driver_*</em> queue functions were changed to have larger length arguments and return values. This is a lesser problem since code that passes smaller types will get them auto converted in the calls and as long as the driver does not handle sizes that overflow an <em>int</em> all will work as before.</p>

      REWRITES FOR 64-BIT DRIVER INTERFACE
    "
</pre>
<p>For erts-5.9 two new integer types <strong>ErlDrvSizeT</strong> and <strong>ErlDrvSSizeT</strong> were introduced that can hold 64-bit sizes if necessary.</p><p>To not update a driver and just recompile it probably works when building for a 32-bit machine creating a false sense of security. Hopefully that will generate many important warnings. But when recompiling the same driver later on for a 64-bit machine there <em>will</em> be warnings and almost certainly crashes. So it is a BAD idea to postpone updating the driver and not fixing the warnings!</p><p>When recompiling with <em>gcc</em> use the <em>-Wstrict-prototypes</em> flag to get better warnings. Try to find a similar flag if you are using some other compiler.</p><p>Here follows a checklist for rewriting a pre erts-5.9 driver, most important first.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>

  <dd>
    <p>Return types for driver callbacks: Rewrite driver callback <em></em><strong>control</strong> to use return type <em>ErlDrvSSizeT</em> instead of <em>int</em>.</p><p>Rewrite driver callback <em></em><strong>call</strong> to use return type <em>ErlDrvSSizeT</em> instead of <em>int</em>.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p><strong></strong> Note:</p><p>These changes are essential to not crash the emulator or worse cause malfunction. Without them a driver may return garbage in the high 32 bits to the emulator causing it to build a huge result from random bytes either crashing on memory allocation or succeeding with a random result from the driver call.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>

    <p>Arguments to driver callbacks: Driver callback <em></em><strong>output</strong> now gets <em>ErlDrvSizeT</em> as 3rd argument instead of previously <em>int</em>.</p><p>Driver callback <em></em><strong>control</strong> now gets <em>ErlDrvSizeT</em> as 4th and 6th arguments instead of previously <em>int</em>.</p><p>Driver callback <em></em><strong>call</strong> now gets <em>ErlDrvSizeT</em> as 4th and 6th arguments instead of previously <em>int</em>.</p><p>Sane compiler's calling conventions probably make these changes necessary only for a driver to handle data chunks that require 64-bit size fields (mostly larger than 2 GB since that is what an <em>int</em> of 32 bits can hold). But it is possible to think of non-sane calling conventions that would make the driver callbacks mix up the arguments causing malfunction.</p>

<p>The <em>ErlDrvBinary</em> structure is a binary, as sent between the emulator and the driver. All binaries are reference counted; when <em>driver_binary_free</em> is called, the reference count is decremented, when it reaches zero, the binary is deallocated. The <em>orig_size</em> is the size of the binary, and <em>orig_bytes</em> is the buffer. The <em>ErlDrvBinary</em> does not have a fixed size, its size is <em>orig_size + 2 * sizeof(int)</em>.</p><p><strong></strong> Note:</p><p>The <em>refc</em> field has been removed. The reference count of an <em>ErlDrvBinary</em> is now stored elsewhere. The reference count of an <em>ErlDrvBinary</em> can be accessed via <strong>driver_binary_get_refc()</strong>, <strong>driver_binary_inc_refc()</strong>, and <strong>driver_binary_dec_refc()</strong>.</p><p>Some driver calls, such as <em>driver_enq_binary</em>, increment the driver reference count, and others, such as <em>driver_deq</em> decrement it.</p><p>Using a driver binary instead of a normal buffer, is often faster, since the emulator doesn't need to copy the data, only the pointer is used.</p><p>A driver binary allocated in the driver, with <em>driver_alloc_binary</em>, should be freed in the driver (unless otherwise stated), with <em>driver_free_binary</em>. (Note that this doesn't necessarily deallocate it, if the driver is still referred in the emulator, the ref-count will not go to zero.)</p><p>Driver binaries are used in the <em>driver_output2</em> and <em>driver_outputv</em> calls, and in the queue. Also the driver call-back <strong>outputv</strong> uses driver binaries.</p><p>If the driver for some reason or another, wants to keep a driver binary around, in a static variable for instance, the reference count should be incremented, and the binary can later be freed in the <strong>stop</strong> call-back, with <em>driver_free_binary</em>.</p><p>Note that since a driver binary is shared by the driver and the emulator, a binary received from the emulator or sent to the emulator, must not be changed by the driver.</p><p>Since erts version 5.5 (OTP release R11B), orig_bytes is guaranteed to be properly aligned for storage of an array of doubles (usually 8-byte aligned).</p>

    <p>ErlDrvPDL: If certain port specific data have to be accessed from other threads than those calling the driver call-backs, a port data lock can be used in order to synchronize the operations on the data. Currently, the only port specific data that the emulator associates with the port data lock is the driver queue.</p><p>Normally a driver instance does not have a port data lock. If the driver instance wants to use a port data lock, it has to create the port data lock by calling <strong>driver_pdl_create()</strong>. <em>NOTE</em>: Once the port data lock has been created, every access to data associated with the port data lock has to be done while having the port data lock locked. The port data lock is locked, and unlocked, respectively, by use of <strong>driver_pdl_lock()</strong>, and <strong>driver_pdl_unlock()</strong>.</p><p>A port data lock is reference counted, and when the reference count reaches zero, it will be destroyed. The emulator will at least increment the reference count once when the lock is created and decrement it once when the port associated with the lock terminates. The emulator will also increment the reference count when an async job is enqueued and decrement it after an async job has been invoked. Besides this, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that the reference count does not reach zero before the last use of the lock by the driver has been made. The reference count can be read, incremented, and decremented, respectively, by use of <strong>driver_pdl_get_refc()</strong>, <strong>driver_pdl_inc_refc()</strong>, and <strong>driver_pdl_dec_refc()</strong>.</p>

<p><strong></strong> void driver_system_info(ErlDrvSysInfo *sys_info_ptr, size_t size)</p><p>This function will write information about the Erlang runtime system into the <strong>ErlDrvSysInfo</strong> structure referred to by the first argument. The second argument should be the size of the <strong>ErlDrvSysInfo</strong> structure, i.e., <em>sizeof(ErlDrvSysInfo)</em>.</p><p>See the documentation of the <strong>ErlDrvSysInfo</strong> structure for information about specific fields.</p><p><strong></strong> int driver_output(ErlDrvPort port, char *buf, ErlDrvSizeT len)</p><p>The <em>driver_output</em> function is used to send data from the driver up to the emulator. The data will be received as terms or binary data, depending on how the driver port was opened.</p><p>The data is queued in the port owner process' message queue. Note that this does not yield to the emulator. (Since the driver and the emulator run in the same thread.)</p><p>The parameter <em>buf</em> points to the data to send, and <em>len</em> is the number of bytes.</p><p>The return value for all output functions is 0. (Unless the driver is used for distribution, in which case it can fail and return -1. For normal use, the output function always returns 0.)</p><p><strong></strong> int driver_output2(ErlDrvPort port, char *hbuf, ErlDrvSizeT hlen, char *buf, ErlDrvSizeT len)</p><p>The <em>driver_output2</em> function first sends <em>hbuf</em> (length in <em>hlen</em>) data as a list, regardless of port settings. Then <em>buf</em> is sent as a binary or list. E.g. if <em>hlen</em> is 3 then the port owner process will receive <em>[H1, H2, H3 | T]</em>.</p><p>The point of sending data as a list header, is to facilitate matching on the data received.</p><p>The return value is 0 for normal use.</p><p><strong></strong> int driver_output_binary(ErlDrvPort port, char *hbuf, ErlDrvSizeT hlen, ErlDrvBinary* bin, ErlDrvSizeT offset, ErlDrvSizeT len)</p><p>This function sends data to port owner process from a driver binary, it has a header buffer (<em>hbuf</em> and <em>hlen</em>) just like <em>driver_output2</em>. The <em>hbuf</em> parameter can be <em>NULL</em>.</p><p>The parameter <em>offset</em> is an offset into the binary and <em>len</em> is the number of bytes to send.</p><p>Driver binaries are created with <em>driver_alloc_binary</em>.</p><p>The data in the header is sent as a list and the binary as an Erlang binary in the tail of the list.</p><p>E.g. if <em>hlen</em> is 2, then the port owner process will receive <em>[H1, H2 | &lt;&lt;T&gt;&gt;]</em>.</p><p>The return value is 0 for normal use.</p><p>Note that, using the binary syntax in Erlang, the driver application can match the header directly from the binary, so the header can be put in the binary, and hlen can be set to 0.</p><p><strong></strong> int driver_outputv(ErlDrvPort port, char* hbuf, ErlDrvSizeT hlen,  ErlIOVec *ev, ErlDrvSizeT skip)</p><p>This function sends data from an IO vector, <em>ev</em>, to the port owner process. It has a header buffer (<em>hbuf</em> and <em>hlen</em>), just like <em>driver_output2</em>.</p><p>The <em>skip</em> parameter is a number of bytes to skip of the <em>ev</em> vector from the head.</p><p>You get vectors of <em>ErlIOVec</em> type from the driver queue (see below), and the <strong>outputv</strong> driver entry function. You can also make them yourself, if you want to send several <em>ErlDrvBinary</em> buffers at once. Often it is faster to use <em>driver_output</em> or <em>driver_output_binary</em>.</p><p>E.g. if <em>hlen</em> is 2 and <em>ev</em> points to an array of three binaries, the port owner process will receive <em>[H1, H2, &lt;&lt;B1&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;B2&gt;&gt; | &lt;&lt;B3&gt;&gt;]</em>.</p><p>The return value is 0 for normal use.</p><p>The comment for <em>driver_output_binary</em> applies for <em>driver_outputv</em> too.</p><p><strong></strong> ErlDrvSizeT driver_vec_to_buf(ErlIOVec *ev, char *buf, ErlDrvSizeT len)</p><p>This function collects several segments of data, referenced by <em>ev</em>, by copying them in order to the buffer <em>buf</em>, of the size <em>len</em>.</p><p>If the data is to be sent from the driver to the port owner process, it is faster to use <em>driver_outputv</em>.</p><p>The return value is the space left in the buffer, i.e. if the <em>ev</em> contains less than <em>len</em> bytes it's the difference, and if <em>ev</em> contains <em>len</em> bytes or more, it's 0. This is faster if there is more than one header byte, since the binary syntax can construct integers directly from the binary.</p><p><strong></strong> int driver_set_timer(ErlDrvPort port, unsigned long time)</p><p>This function sets a timer on the driver, which will count down and call the driver when it is timed out. The <em>time</em> parameter is the time in milliseconds before the timer expires.</p><p>When the timer reaches 0 and expires, the driver entry function <strong>timeout</strong> is called.</p><p>Note that there is only one timer on each driver instance; setting a new timer will replace an older one.</p><p>Return value is 0 (-1 only when the <em>timeout</em> driver function is <em>NULL</em>).</p><p><strong></strong> int driver_cancel_timer(ErlDrvPort port)</p><p>This function cancels a timer set with <em>driver_set_timer</em>.</p><p>The return value is 0.</p><p><strong></strong> int driver_read_timer(ErlDrvPort port, unsigned long *time_left)</p><p>This function reads the current time of a timer, and places the result in <em>time_left</em>. This is the time in milliseconds, before the timeout will occur.</p><p>The return value is 0.</p><p><strong></strong> int driver_get_now(ErlDrvNowData *now)</p><p>This function reads a timestamp into the memory pointed to by the parameter <em>now</em>. See the description of <strong>ErlDrvNowData</strong> for specification of its fields.</p><p>The return value is 0 unless the <em>now</em> pointer is not valid, in which case it is &lt; 0.</p><p><strong></strong> int driver_select(ErlDrvPort port, ErlDrvEvent event, int mode, int on)</p><p>This function is used by drivers to provide the emulator with events to check for. This enables the emulator to call the driver when something has happened asynchronously.</p><p>The <em>event</em> argument identifies an OS-specific event object. On Unix systems, the functions <em>select</em>/<em>poll</em> are used. The event object must be a socket or pipe (or other object that <em>select</em>/<em>poll</em> can use). On windows, the Win32 API function <em>WaitForMultipleObjects</em> is used. This places other restrictions on the event object. Refer to the Win32 SDK documentation. On Enea OSE, the receive function is used. See the <strong></strong>for more details.</p><p>The <em>on</em> parameter should be <em>1</em> for setting events and <em>0</em> for clearing them.</p><p>The <em>mode</em> argument is a bitwise-or combination of <em>ERL_DRV_READ</em>, <em>ERL_DRV_WRITE</em> and <em>ERL_DRV_USE</em>. The first two specify whether to wait for read events and/or write events. A fired read event will call <strong>ready_input</strong> while a fired write event will call <strong>ready_output</strong>.</p><p><strong></strong> Note:</p><p>Some OS (Windows and Enea OSE) do not differentiate between read and write events. The call-back for a fired event then only depends on the value of <em>mode</em>.</p><p><em>ERL_DRV_USE</em> specifies if we are using the event object or if we want to close it. On an emulator with SMP support, it is not safe to clear all events and then close the event object after <em>driver_select</em> has returned. Another thread may still be using the event object internally. To safely close an event object call <em>driver_select</em> with <em>ERL_DRV_USE</em> and <em>on==0</em>. That will clear all events and then call <strong>stop_select</strong> when it is safe to close the event object. <em>ERL_DRV_USE</em> should be set together with the first event for an event object. It is harmless to set <em>ERL_DRV_USE</em> even though it already has been done. Clearing all events but keeping <em>ERL_DRV_USE</em> set will indicate that we are using the event object and probably will set events for it again.</p><p><strong></strong> Note:</p><p>ERL_DRV_USE was added in OTP release R13. Old drivers will still work as before. But it is recommended to update them to use <em>ERL_DRV_USE</em> and <em>stop_select</em> to make sure that event objects are closed in a safe way.</p><p>The return value is 0 (failure, -1, only if the <em>ready_input</em>/<em>ready_output</em> is <em>NULL</em>).</p><p><strong></strong> void *driver_alloc(ErlDrvSizeT size)</p><p>This function allocates a memory block of the size specified in <em>size</em>, and returns it. This only fails on out of memory, in that case <em>NULL</em> is returned. (This is most often a wrapper for <em>malloc</em>).</p><p>Memory allocated must be explicitly freed with a corresponding call to <em>driver_free</em> (unless otherwise stated).</p><p>This function is thread-safe.</p><p><strong></strong> void *driver_realloc(void *ptr, ErlDrvSizeT size)</p><p>This function resizes a memory block, either in place, or by allocating a new block, copying the data and freeing the old block. A pointer is returned to the reallocated memory. On failure (out of memory), <em>NULL</em> is returned. (This is most often a wrapper for <em>realloc</em>.)</p><p>This function is thread-safe.</p><p><strong></strong> void driver_free(void *ptr)</p><p>This function frees the memory pointed to by <em>ptr</em>. The memory should have been allocated with <em>driver_alloc</em>. All allocated memory should be deallocated, just once. There is no garbage collection in drivers.</p><p>This function is thread-safe.</p><p><strong></strong> ErlDrvBinary *driver_alloc_binary(ErlDrvSizeT size)</p><p>This function allocates a driver binary with a memory block of at least <em>size</em> bytes, and returns a pointer to it, or NULL on failure (out of memory). When a driver binary has been sent to the emulator, it must not be altered. Every allocated binary should be freed by a corresponding call to <em>driver_free_binary</em> (unless otherwise stated).</p><p>Note that a driver binary has an internal reference counter, this means that calling <em>driver_free_binary</em> it may not actually dispose of it.

This enables the driver to perform time-consuming, blocking operations without blocking the emulator.</p><p>The async thread pool size can be set with the <strong>+A</strong> command line argument of <a href="../man1/erl.1.html"><strong>erl</strong>(1)</a></strong>. If no async thread pool is available, the call is made synchronously in the thread calling <em>driver_async()</em>. The current number of async threads in the async thread pool can be retrieved via <strong>driver_system_info()</strong>.</p><p>If there is a thread pool available, a thread will be used. If the <em>key</em> argument is null, the threads from the pool are used in a round-robin way, each call to <em>driver_async</em> uses the next thread in the pool. With the <em>key</em> argument set, this behaviour is changed. The two same values of <em>*key</em> always get the same thread.</p><p>To make sure that a driver instance always uses the same thread, the following call can be used:</p>
<pre>
    unsigned int myKey = driver_async_port_key(myPort);

    r = driver_async(myPort, &myKey, myData, myFunc);

</pre>
<p>It is enough to initialize <em>myKey</em> once for each driver instance.</p><p>If a thread is already working, the calls will be queued up and executed in order. Using the same thread for each driver instance ensures that the calls will be made in sequence.</p><p>The <em>async_data</em> is the argument to the functions <em>async_invoke</em> and <em>async_free</em>. It's typically a pointer to a structure that contains a pipe or event that can be used to signal that the async operation completed. The data should be freed in <em>async_free</em>.</p><p>When the async operation is done, <strong>ready_async</strong> driver entry function is called. If <em>ready_async</em> is null in the driver entry, the <em>async_free</em> function is called instead.</p><p>The return value is a handle to the asynchronous task.</p><p><strong></strong> Note:</p><p>As of erts version 5.5.4.3 the default stack size for threads in the async-thread pool is 16 kilowords, i.e., 64 kilobyte on 32-bit architectures. This small default size has been chosen since the amount of async-threads might be quite large. The default stack size is enough for drivers delivered with Erlang/OTP, but might not be sufficiently large for other dynamically linked in drivers that use the driver_async() functionality. A suggested stack size for threads in the async-thread pool can be configured via the <strong>+a</strong> command line argument of <a href="../man1/erl.1.html"><strong>erl</strong>(1)</a></strong>.</p><p><strong></strong> unsigned int driver_async_port_key (ErlDrvPort port)</p><p>This function calculates a key for later use in <strong>driver_async()</strong>. The keys are evenly distributed so that a fair mapping between port id's and async thread id's is achieved.</p><p><strong></strong> Note:</p><p>Before OTP-R16, the actual port id could be used as a key with proper casting, but after the rewrite of the port subsystem, this is no longer the case. With this function, you can achieve the same distribution based on port id's as before OTP-R16.</p><p><strong></strong> int driver_lock_driver(ErlDrvPort port)</p><p>This function locks the driver used by the port <em>port</em> in memory for the rest of the emulator process' lifetime. After this call, the driver behaves as one of Erlang's statically linked in drivers.</p><p><strong></strong> ErlDrvPort driver_create_port(ErlDrvPort port, ErlDrvTermData owner_pid, char* name, ErlDrvData drv_data)</p><p>This function creates a new port executing the same driver code as the port creating the new port.

<p>This function retrieves the value of an environment variable. When called, <em>*value_size</em> should contain the size of the <em>value</em> buffer. On success <em>0</em> is returned, the value of the environment variable has been written to the <em>value</em> buffer, and <em>*value_size</em> contains the string length (excluding the terminating null character) of the value written to the <em>value</em> buffer. On failure, i.e., no such environment variable was found, a value less than <em>0</em> is returned. When the size of the <em>value</em> buffer is too small, a value greater than <em>0</em> is returned and <em>*value_size</em> has been set to the buffer size needed.</p><p><strong></strong> Warning:</p><p>Do <em>not</em> use libc's <em>getenv</em> or similar C library interfaces from a driver.</p><p>This function is thread-safe.</p><p><strong></strong> int erl_drv_consume_timeslice(ErlDrvPort port, int percent)</p><p>Arguments:</p>

</dl>
<p>Give the runtime system a hint about how much CPU time the current driver callback call has consumed since last hint, or since the start of the callback if no previous hint has been given. The time is given as a fraction, in percent, of a full time-slice that a port is allowed to execute before it should surrender the CPU to other runnable ports or processes. Valid range is <em>[1, 100]</em>. The scheduling time-slice is not an exact entity, but can usually be approximated to about 1 millisecond.</p><p>Note that it is up to the runtime system to determine if and how to use this information. Implementations on some platforms may use other means in order to determine the consumed fraction of the time-slice. Lengthy driver callbacks should regardless of this frequently call the <em>erl_drv_consume_timeslice()</em> function in order to determine if it is allowed to continue execution or not.</p><p><em>erl_drv_consume_timeslice()</em> returns a non-zero value if the time-slice has been exhausted, and zero if the callback is allowed to continue execution. If a non-zero value is returned the driver callback should return as soon as possible in order for the port to be able to yield.</p><p>This function is provided to better support co-operative scheduling, improve system responsiveness, and to make it easier to prevent misbehaviors of the VM due to a port monopolizing a scheduler thread. It can be used when dividing length work into a number of repeated driver callback calls without the need to use threads.
