        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <em>release handler</em> is a process belonging to the SASL application which is responsible for <em>release handling</em>, that is, unpacking, installation, and removal of release packages.</p><p>An introduction to release handling and a usage example can be found in <strong>Design Principles</strong>.</p><p>A <em>release package</em> is a compressed tar file containing code for a certain version of a release, created by calling <strong>systools:make_tar/1,2</strong>. The release package should be placed in the <em>$ROOT/releases</em> directory of the previous version of the release where <em>$ROOT</em> is the installation root directory, <em>code:root_dir()</em>. Another <em>releases</em> directory can be specified using the SASL configuration parameter <em>releases_dir</em>, or the OS environment variable <em>RELDIR</em>. The release handler must have write access to this directory in order to install the new release. The persistent state of the release handler is stored there in a file called <em>RELEASES</em>.</p><p>A release package should always contain the release resource file <em>Name.rel</em> and a boot script <em>Name.boot</em>. It may contain a release upgrade file <em>relup</em> and a system configuration file <em>sys.config</em>. The <em>.rel</em> file contains information about the release: its name, version, and which ERTS and application versions it uses. The <em>relup</em> file contains scripts for how to upgrade to, or downgrade from, this version of the release.</p><p>The release package can be <em>unpacked</em>, which extracts the files. An unpacked release can be <em>installed</em>. The currently used version of the release is then upgraded or downgraded to the specified version by evaluating the instructions in <em>relup</em>. An installed release can be made <em>permanent</em>. There can only be one permanent release in the system, and this is the release that is used if the system is restarted. An installed release, except the permanent one, can be <em>removed</em>. When a release is removed, all files that belong to that release only are deleted.</p><p>Each version of the release has a status. The status can be <em>unpacked</em>, <em>current</em>, <em>permanent</em>, or <em>old</em>. There is always one latest release which either has status <em>permanent</em> (normal case), or <em>current</em> (installed, but not yet made permanent). The following table illustrates the meaning of the status values:</p>
<pre>
Status     Action                NextStatus
-------------------------------------------
  -        unpack                unpacked
unpacked   install               current
           remove                  -
current    make_permanent        permanent
           install other         old
           remove                  -
permanent  make other permanent  old
           install               permanent
old        reboot_old            permanent
           install               current
           remove                  -

</pre>
<p>The release handler process is a locally registered process on each node. When a release is installed in a distributed system, the release handler on each node must be called. The release installation may be synchronized between nodes. From an operator view, it may be unsatisfactory to specify each node. The aim is to install one release package in the system, no matter how many nodes there are. If this is the case, it is recommended that software management functions are written which take care of this problem. Such a function may have knowledge of the system architecture, so it can contact each individual release handler to install the package.</p><p>For release handling to work properly, the runtime system needs to have knowledge about which release it is currently running. It must also be able to change (in run-time) which boot script and system configuration file should be used if the system is restarted. This is taken care of automatically if Erlang is started as an embedded system. Read about this in <em>Embedded System</em>. In this case, the system configuration file <em>sys.config</em> is mandatory.</p><p>The installation of a new release may restart the system. Which program to use is specified by the SASL configuration parameter <em>start_prg</em> which defaults to <em>$ROOT/bin/start</em>.</p><p>The emulator restart on Windows NT expects that the system is started using the <em>erlsrv</em> program (as a service). Furthermore the release handler expects that the service is named <em>NodeName</em>_<em>Release</em>, where <em>NodeName</em> is the first part of the Erlang nodename (up to, but not including the "@") and <em>Release</em> is the current version of the release. The release handler furthermore expects that a program like <em>start_erl.exe</em> is specified as "machine" to <em>erlsrv</em>. During upgrading with restart, a new service will be registered and started. The new service will be set to automatic and the old service removed as soon as the new release is made permanent.</p><p>The release handler at a node which runs on a diskless machine, or with a read-only file system, must be configured accordingly using the following <em>sasl</em> configuration parameters (see <a href="../man7/sasl.7.html"><strong>sasl</strong>(7)</a></strong> for details):</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>masters</em>: This node uses a number of master nodes in order to store and fetch release information. All master nodes must be up and running whenever release information is written by this node.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>client_directory</em>: The <em>client_directory</em> in the directory structure of the master nodes must be specified.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>static_emulator</em>: This parameter specifies if the Erlang emulator is statically installed at the client node. A node with a static emulator cannot dynamically switch to a new emulator because the executable files are statically written into memory.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>It is also possible to use the release handler to unpack and install release packages when not running Erlang as an embedded system, but in this case the user must somehow make sure that correct boot scripts and configuration files are used if the system needs to be restarted.</p><p>There are additional functions for using another file structure than the structure defined in OTP. These functions can be used to test a release upgrade locally.</p>

Looks first for a <em>relup</em> file for <em>Vsn</em> and a script <em>{UpFromVsn,Descr1,Instructions1}</em> in this file for upgrading from the current version. If not found, the function looks for a <em>relup</em> file for the current version and a script <em>{Vsn,Descr2,Instructions2}</em> in this file for downgrading to <em>Vsn</em>.</p><p>If a script is found, the first thing that happens is that the applications specifications are updated according to the <em>.app</em> files and <em>sys.config</em> belonging to the release version <em>Vsn</em>.</p><p>After the application specifications have been updated, the instructions in the script are evaluated and the function returns <em>{ok,OtherVsn,Descr}</em> if successful. <em>OtherVsn</em> and <em>Descr</em> are the version (<em>UpFromVsn</em> or <em>Vsn</em>) and description (<em>Descr1</em> or <em>Descr2</em>) as specified in the script.</p><p>If <em>{continue_after_restart,OtherVsn,Descr}</em> is returned, it means that the emulator will be restarted before the upgrade instructions are executed. This will happen if the emulator or any of the applications kernel, stdlib or sasl are updated. The new version of the emulator and these core applications will execute after the restart, but for all other applications the old versions will be started and the upgrade will be performed as normal by executing the upgrade instructions.</p><p>If a recoverable error occurs, the function returns <em>{error,Reason}</em> and the original application specifications are restored. If a non-recoverable error occurs, the system is restarted.</p><p>The option <em>error_action</em> defines if the node should be restarted (<em>init:restart()</em>) or rebooted (<em>init:reboot()</em>) in case of an error during the installation. Default is <em>restart</em>.</p><p>The option <em>code_change_timeout</em> defines the timeout for all calls to <em>sys:change_code</em>. If no value is specified or <em>default</em> is given, the default value defined in <em>sys</em> is used.</p><p>The option <em>suspend_timeout</em> defines the timeout for all calls to <em>sys:suspend</em>. If no value is specified, the values defined by the <em>Timeout</em> parameter of the <em>upgrade</em> or <em>suspend</em> instructions are used. If <em>default</em> is specified, the default value defined in <em>sys</em> is used.</p><p>The option <em>{update_paths,Bool}</em> indicates if all application code paths should be updated (<em>Bool==true</em>), or if only code paths for modified applications should be updated (<em>Bool==false</em>, default). This option only has effect for other application directories than the default <em>$ROOT/lib/App-Vsn</em>, that is, application directories provided in the <em>AppDirs</em> argument in a call to <em>create_RELEASES/4</em> or <em>set_unpacked/2</em>.</p><p>Example: In the current version <em>CurVsn</em> of a release, the application directory of <em>myapp</em> is <em>$ROOT/lib/myapp-1.0</em>. A new version <em>NewVsn</em> is unpacked outside the release handler, and the release handler is informed about this with a call to:</p>
<pre>
release_handler:set_unpacked(RelFile, [{myapp,"1.0","/home/user"},...]).
=&gt; {ok,NewVsn}

</pre>
<p>If <em>NewVsn</em> is installed with the option <em>{update_paths,true}</em>, afterwards <em>code:lib_dir(myapp)</em> will return <em>/home/user/myapp-1.0</em>.</p><p><strong></strong> Note:</p><p>Installing a new release might be quite time consuming if there are many processes in the system. The reason is that each process must be checked for references to old code before a module can be purged. This check might lead to garbage collections and copying of data.</p><p>If you wish to speed up the execution of <em>install_release</em>, then you may call <strong>check_install_release</strong> first, using the option <em>purge</em>. This will do the same check for old code, and then purge all modules that can be soft purged. The purged modules will then no longer have any old code, and <em>install_release</em> will not need to do the checks.</p><p>Obviously, this will not reduce the overall time for the upgrade, but it will allow checks and purge to be executed in the background before the real upgrade is started.</p><p><strong></strong> Note:</p><p>When upgrading the emulator from a version older than OTP R15, there will be an attempt to load new application beam code into the old emulator. In some cases, the new beam format can not be read by the old emulator, and so the code loading will fail and terminate the complete upgrade. To overcome this problem, the new application code should be compiled with the old emulator. See <strong>Design Principles</strong> for more information about emulator upgrade from pre OTP R15 versions.</p><p><strong></strong> make_permanent(Vsn) -&gt; ok | {error, Reason}</p><p>Types:</p><p>Vsn = string()</p><p>Reason = {bad_status, Status} | term()</p><p>Makes the specified version <em>Vsn</em> of the release permanent.</p><p><strong></strong> remove_release(Vsn) -&gt; ok | {error, Reason}</p><p>Types:</p><p>Vsn = string()</p><p>Reason = {permanent, Vsn} | client_node | term()</p><p>Removes a release and its files from the system.

<p>The following functions can be used to test upgrade and downgrade of single applications (instead of upgrading/downgrading an entire release).
