  <title>dashpack: A set of routines allowing you to draw curves using dashed-line patterns that may include gap-portion specifiers, solid-portion specifiers, and label-string specifiers.  dashpack is intended to replace and unify the old family of ncar graphics routines (dashline, dashchar, dashsmth, and dashsupr), all of which date from the early 1970s or before.  at the time of its introduction, dashpack will do anything that dashline, dashchar, and dashsmth will (and a number of things that they won't); it does not yet functionally replace all of dashsupr, but it is intended that this will eventually happen.  for the moment, the older routines will stay in ncar graphics.  structurally, dashpack is rather different from the routines that it replaces: its behavior is controlled by "internal parameters" that are accessed by calling parameter-access routines, rather than by manipulating the contents of labelled common blocks. there is only one version of dashpack; rather than load a different version of it in order to, say, turn smoothing on, one just changes the value of the internal parameter that controls whether or not smoothing is done. there is no analog of the old routines dashdb and dashdc in dashpack; to use a different dash pattern, one just changes the values of the internal parameters that specify what dash pattern to use.  as in other ncar graphics packages, each of the internal parameters of dashpack has a three-character mnemonic name. the internal parameters are described in detail in the man page "dashpack_params".  dashed-line patterns  a dashed-line pattern (or just "dash pattern") may be specified using either an integer or a character string (see the parameters 'dpl', 'dps', and 'dpt'). however the pattern is specified, it is applied in a repetitive fashion as a curve is drawn. for example, if the dash pattern specifies a solid, a gap, and the label "a", a curve drawn using it will include a solid, a gap, the label "a", a solid, a gap, the label "a", and so on, until the end of the curve is reached. when a new curve is begun, use of the dash pattern starts over: the new curve starts with a solid, a gap, and the label "a".  if an integer dash pattern is used, the low-order "n" bits of the integer (where "n" is the absolute value of the user-specified parameter, 'dps', and is between 1 and 32, inclusive) are interpreted; 0's represent gaps and 1's represent solids.  in a character-string dash pattern, the character used to represent a gap (by default, an underscore) and the character used to represent a solid (by default, a dollar sign) are determined by the values of other internal parameters ('crg' and 'crs'); such characters may be mixed with other strings of characters that are to be used as label strings. there are parameters allowing one to specify how much distance along the curve should be devoted to each gap ('wog') and solid ('wos'), what size characters should be used for writing label strings ('woc'), whether label strings should be written at a fixed angle relative to the plotter frame or in the direction of the curve ('saf'), and, if they are written in the direction of the curve, whether or not they should be made to "bend" with the curve ('crb' and 'scf') and whether or not it is allowed to rotate them by 180 degrees to make them more nearly upright on the plotter frame ('saf').  a label string written along a curve may either be placed in a gap left in the curve or just written on top of it ('ls1', 'ls2', and 'ltl'); the latter is most effective when the characters are written in a color different from that of the curve itself.  output of label strings is buffered so that, if the end of the curve occurs prior to the occurrence of the next solid or gap in the dash pattern, the curve itself may be drawn in lieu of an incomplete label, and so that, when labels are being made to "bend" with the curve, the entire label can be inverted, if necessary, so as to have the majority of it right-side up. this buffering is done by default, but may be turned off, if desired ('sbf').  all character strings are written using calls to plotchar routines. there is an internal parameter ('pcf') that says whether to call plchhq, plchmq, or plchlq. by default, plchhq is used.  curve smoothing  curve smoothing is turned on and off by setting a single internal parameter ('tcs') that also specifies the tension on the cubic splines used to do the smoothing. another parameter ('ssl') specifies the distance between points used to plot the smoothed curve and another ('eps') specifies the minimum distance between input points required for them to be considered separate points.</title>

      <span itemprop="name">dashpack: A set of routines allowing you to draw curves using dashed-line patterns that may include gap-portion specifiers, solid-portion specifiers, and label-string specifiers.  dashpack is intended to replace and unify the old family of ncar graphics routines (dashline, dashchar, dashsmth, and dashsupr), all of which date from the early 1970s or before.  at the time of its introduction, dashpack will do anything that dashline, dashchar, and dashsmth will (and a number of things that they won't); it does not yet functionally replace all of dashsupr, but it is intended that this will eventually happen.  for the moment, the older routines will stay in ncar graphics.  structurally, dashpack is rather different from the routines that it replaces: its behavior is controlled by "internal parameters" that are accessed by calling parameter-access routines, rather than by manipulating the contents of labelled common blocks. there is only one version of dashpack; rather than load a different version of it in order to, say, turn smoothing on, one just changes the value of the internal parameter that controls whether or not smoothing is done. there is no analog of the old routines dashdb and dashdc in dashpack; to use a different dash pattern, one just changes the values of the internal parameters that specify what dash pattern to use.  as in other ncar graphics packages, each of the internal parameters of dashpack has a three-character mnemonic name. the internal parameters are described in detail in the man page "dashpack_params".  dashed-line patterns  a dashed-line pattern (or just "dash pattern") may be specified using either an integer or a character string (see the parameters 'dpl', 'dps', and 'dpt'). however the pattern is specified, it is applied in a repetitive fashion as a curve is drawn. for example, if the dash pattern specifies a solid, a gap, and the label "a", a curve drawn using it will include a solid, a gap, the label "a", a solid, a gap, the label "a", and so on, until the end of the curve is reached. when a new curve is begun, use of the dash pattern starts over: the new curve starts with a solid, a gap, and the label "a".  if an integer dash pattern is used, the low-order "n" bits of the integer (where "n" is the absolute value of the user-specified parameter, 'dps', and is between 1 and 32, inclusive) are interpreted; 0's represent gaps and 1's represent solids.  in a character-string dash pattern, the character used to represent a gap (by default, an underscore) and the character used to represent a solid (by default, a dollar sign) are determined by the values of other internal parameters ('crg' and 'crs'); such characters may be mixed with other strings of characters that are to be used as label strings. there are parameters allowing one to specify how much distance along the curve should be devoted to each gap ('wog') and solid ('wos'), what size characters should be used for writing label strings ('woc'), whether label strings should be written at a fixed angle relative to the plotter frame or in the direction of the curve ('saf'), and, if they are written in the direction of the curve, whether or not they should be made to "bend" with the curve ('crb' and 'scf') and whether or not it is allowed to rotate them by 180 degrees to make them more nearly upright on the plotter frame ('saf').  a label string written along a curve may either be placed in a gap left in the curve or just written on top of it ('ls1', 'ls2', and 'ltl'); the latter is most effective when the characters are written in a color different from that of the curve itself.  output of label strings is buffered so that, if the end of the curve occurs prior to the occurrence of the next solid or gap in the dash pattern, the curve itself may be drawn in lieu of an incomplete label, and so that, when labels are being made to "bend" with the curve, the entire label can be inverted, if necessary, so as to have the majority of it right-side up. this buffering is done by default, but may be turned off, if desired ('sbf').  all character strings are written using calls to plotchar routines. there is an internal parameter ('pcf') that says whether to call plchhq, plchmq, or plchlq. by default, plchhq is used.  curve smoothing  curve smoothing is turned on and off by setting a single internal parameter ('tcs') that also specifies the tension on the cubic splines used to do the smoothing. another parameter ('ssl') specifies the distance between points used to plot the smoothed curve and another ('eps') specifies the minimum distance between input points required for them to be considered separate points.</span>

<p>When error conditions are detected, the support routine SETER is called. By default, SETER writes a message to the standard error file (as defined by <strong>I1MACH</strong>(4)) and then terminates execution.  It is possible to put SETER into recovery mode and regain control after a recoverable error (which includes all of the possible errors).</p><p>The possible error messages are listed below.  All errors are recoverable in the sense that a user program which has called ENTSR to set recovery mode will get control back after one of these errors occurs.</p><p>DPCURV - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR</p><p>This error message indicates that, at the time DPCURV was called, there was an unrecovered outstanding error. In this case, DPCURV cannot continue; it forces the error message for the outstanding error to be printed and then substitutes this one for it.</p><p>DPDRAW - IMPLEMENTATION ERROR - SEE SPECIALIST</p><p>An internal error has occurred which indicates that DASHPACK has not been correctly installed.
