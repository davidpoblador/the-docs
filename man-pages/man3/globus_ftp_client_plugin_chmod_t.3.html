        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Plugin API.</p><p>A plugin is a way to implement application-independent reliability and performance tuning behavior. Plugins are written using the API described in this document.</p><p>A plugin is created by defining a globus_ftp_client_plugin_t which contains the function pointers and plugin-specific data needed for the plugin's operation. It is recommended that a plugin define a a globus_module_descriptor_t and plugin initialization functions, to ensure that the plugin is properly initialized.</p><p>The functions pointed to in a plugin are called when significant events in the life of an FTP Client operation occur. Note that plugins will only be called when the plugin has the function pointer for both the operation (get, put, list, etc), and the event (connect, authenticate, command, etc), are defined. The command and response functions are filtered based on the command_mask defined in the plugin structure.</p><p>Every plugin must define <strong>copy </strong> and <strong>destroy </strong> functions. The copy function is called when the plugin is added to an attribute set or a handle is initialized with an attribute set containing the plugin. The destroy function is called when the handle or attribute set is destroyed.</p>
