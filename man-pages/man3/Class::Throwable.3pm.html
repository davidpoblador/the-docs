        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>This module implements a minimal lightweight exception object. It is meant to be a compromise between more basic solutions like Carp which can only print information and cannot handle exception objects, and more more complex solutions like Exception::Class which can be used to define complex inline exceptions and has a number of module dependencies.</p><p><strong>&#92;$1</strong></p><p>You can easily create new exception classes inline by passing them with the \*(C`use\*(C' statment like this:</p><p>  use Class::Throwable (&apos;My::InlineException&apos;, &apos;My::Other::InlineException&apos;);</p><p>This is a quick and easy way to define arbitrary exception classes without the need to manually create seperate files or packages for them. However, it should be noted that subclasses of Class::Throwable cannot be used to define inline exceptions. If you attempt to do this, an exception will be thrown. Class::Throwable offeres a number of different types of diagnostic outputs to suit your needs. Most of this is controlled through the verbosity levels. If the verbosity level is set to 0 or below, an empty string is returned. If the value is set to 1, then the exception's message is returned. If the value is set to 2 or above, a full stack trace along with full stack traces for all sub-exceptions are returned in the format shown in \*(C`stackTraceToString\*(C'. The default verbosity setting is 1.</p><p>There are a number of ways in which you can set the verbosity of the exceptions produced by Class::Throwable. The simplest way is as the argument to the \*(C`toString\*(C' method. Using this method will override any other settings you may have, and insure that the output of this method is as you ask it to be.</p><p>  $@-&gt;<strong>toString</strong>(2);</p><p>However, to use this style properly, this requires that you test the value of $@ to be sure it is a Class::Throwable object. In some cases, this may not be an issue, while in others, it makes more sense to set verbosity on a wider scale.</p><p>For instance, if you define inline exceptions, then the simplest way to set a verbostity level for a particular inline exception is through the class method \*(C`setVerbosity\*(C'.</p><p>  use Class::Throwable qw(My::InlineException);</p><p>  My::InlineException-&gt;<strong>setVerbosity</strong>(2);</p><p>This means that unless the \*(C`toString\*(C' verbosity argument overrides it, all <em>My::InlineException</em> exceptions will use a verbosity setting of 2. This method means that you can easily \*(C`print\*(C' the value of $@ and then any <em>My::InlineException</em> exceptions will be automatically stringified with a verbosity level of 2. This can simplify exception catching by reducing the need to inspect the value of $@.</p><p>If you defined your exceptions as subclasses of Class::Throwable and stored them in seperate files, then another means of setting the verbosity level is to assign it in the \*(C`use\*(C' statement.</p><p>  use My::SeperateFileSubClass::Exception (VERBOSE =&gt; 2);</p><p>This has the same effect as the \*(C`setVerbosity\*(C' class method, in fact, there is nothing to stop you from using the \*(C`setVerbosity\*(C' class method in this case if you like. This method can also be used on Class::Throwable itself, however, this does not set the verbosity level for all subclasses, only for Class::Throwable exceptions.</p><p>There is one last method which can be used. This method has the widest scope of all the methods. The variable $Class::Throwable::DEFAULT_VERBOSITY can be set. Setting this value will take effect if, 1) there is no value passed to the \*(C`toString\*(C' method and 2) no verbosity level has been set for the particular class, either through \*(C`setVerbosity\*(C' or the \*(C`use\*(C' statement. It is possible to retrofit a module to use Class::Throwable exceptions if you want to. Basially this will allow modules which \*(C`die\*(C' with either strings or some other value, to throw Class::Throwable based exceptions. This feature is relatively new and should be considered to be experimental, any feedback on it is greatly appreciated.</p><p><strong>\s-1NOTE:\s0</strong> It is important to do module retrofitting at the earliest possible moment (peferrably before the module you are retrofitting is compiled), as it will override \*(C`die\*(C' within a specified package.</p><p>Other than all this, retrofitting is quite simple. Here is a basic example:</p><p>  use Class::Throwable retrofit =&gt; &apos;My::Class&apos;;</p><p>Now anytime \*(C`die\*(C' is called within <em>My::Class</em> the calls will get converted to a Class::Throwable instance. You can also control how exceptions are converted like so:</p><p>  use Class::Throwable retrofit =&gt; &apos;My::Class&apos; =&gt; sub { My::Exception-&gt;throw(@_) };</p><p>Now anytime \*(C`die\*(C' is called within <em>My::Class</em> the calls will get converted to a My::Exception instance instead. Or a slightly more complex examples like this:</p><p>  use Class::Throwable retrofit =&gt; (                 &apos;My::Class&apos; =&gt; sub {                     My::IllegalOperation-&gt;throw(@_) if $_[0] =~ /^Illegal Operation/;                     My::Exception-&gt;throw(@_);                 });</p><p>Now anytime \*(C`die\*(C' is called within <em>My::Class</em> the calls will get converted to a My::Exception instance unless the exception matches the reg-exp, in which case an My::IllegalOperation exception is thrown.</p><p>There are a couple of points to be made regarding this functionality. First, it will add another stack frame to your exceptions (the retrofit routine basically). This is probably avoidable, but as this is still experimental I wanted to keep things somewhat simple. And second, if you supply a custom \*(C`die\*(C' handler, you should be sure that it will \*(C`die\*(C' somewhere within that routine. If you do not, you may have many un-intended consequences.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">METHODS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The most common way to construct an exception object is to \*(C`throw\*(C' it. This method will construct the exception object, collect all the information from the call stack and then \*(C`die\*(C'. The optional $message argument can be used to pass custom information along with the exception object. Commonly this will be a string, but this module makes no attempt to enforce that it be anything other than a scalar, so more complex references or objects can be used. If no $message is passed in, a default one will be constructed for you. The second optional argument, $sub_exception, can be used to retain information about an exception which has been caught but might not be appropriate to be re-thrown and is better wrapped within a new exception object. While this argument will commonly be another Class::Throwable object, that fact is not enforced so you can pass in normal string based perl exceptions as well. If this method is called as an instance method on an exception object pre-built with \*(C`new\*(C', only then is the stack trace information populated and the exception is then passed to \*(C`die\*(C'. This is an alternate means of creating an exception object, it is much like \*(C`throw\*(C', except that it does not collect stack trace information or \*(C`die\*(C'. It stores the $message and $sub_exception values, and then returns the exception instance, to be possibly thrown later on.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <strong>setVerbosity ($verbosity)</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a class method, if it is called with an instance, and exception will be thrown. This class method can be used to set the verbosity level for a particular class. See the section \*(L"Exception Verbosity\*(R" above for more details.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>getMessage</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This allows access to the message in the exception, to allow more granular exception reporting.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>getStackTrace</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This returns the raw stack trace information as an array of arrays. There are 10 values returned by \*(C`caller\*(C' ($package, $filename, $line, $subroutine, $hasargs, $wantarray, $evaltext, $is_require, $hints, $bitmask) we do not bother to capture the last two as they are subject to change and meant for internal use, all others are retained in the order returned by \*(C`caller\*(C'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>hasSubException</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The returns true (1) if this exception has a sub-exception, and false (0) otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>getSubException</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This allows access to the stored sub-exception. This object overloads the stringification operator, and will call the \*(C`toString\*(C' method to perform that stringification.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>toString ($verbosity)</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This will print out the exception object's information at a variable level of verbosity which is specified be the optional argument $verbosity. See the section \*(L"Exception Verbosity\*(R" above for more details.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>stringValue</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This will return the normal perl stringified value of the object without going through the \*(C`toString\*(C' method.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong>stackTraceToString</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This method is used to print the stack trace information, the stack trace is presented in the following format:     |--[ main::foo called in my_script.pl line 12 ]     |--[ main::bar called in my_script.pl line 14 ]     |--[ main::baz called in my_script.pl line 16 ]</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">RELATED TO Class::Throwable&hellip;</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>There are a number of ways to do exceptions with perl, I was not really satisifed with the way anyone else did them, so I created this module. However, if you find this module unsatisfactory, you may want to check these out.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    Exception::Class
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This in one of the more common exception classes out there. It does an excellent job with it's default behavior, and allows a number of complex options which can likely serve any needs you might have. My reasoning for not using this module is that I felt these extra options made things more complex than they needed to be, it also introduced a number of dependencies. I am not saying this module is bloated at all, but that for me it was far more than I have found I needed. If you have heavy duty exception needs, this is your module.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Error
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is the classic perl exception module, complete with a try/catch mechanism. This module has a lot of bad karma associated with it because of the obscure nested closure memory leak that try/catch has. I never really liked the way its exception object Error::Simple did things either.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Exception
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This module I have never really experimented with, so take my opinion with a large grain of salt. My problem with this module was always that it seemed to want to do too much. It attempts to make perl into a language with real exceptions, but messing with %SIG handlers and other such things. This can be dangerous territory sometimes, and for me, far more than my needs.</p>
