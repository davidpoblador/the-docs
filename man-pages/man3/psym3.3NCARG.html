        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">C-BINDING SYNOPSIS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>#include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;</p><p>void c_pwrzt (float u, float v, float w, char *chrs, int lchrs,</p><p>int isize, int idir, int itop, int icen)</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    U,V,W
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(input expressions of type REAL) are the U, V, and W coordinates of a point, in the user's 3-space, relative to which the character string is to be positioned.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    CHRS
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(an input constant or variable of type CHARACTER) is the character string to be drawn.  It may contain uppercase alphabetic characters, the digits 0 through 9, and a small set of "special" characters (plus, minus, asterisk, slash, left and right parentheses, equals sign, blank, comma, and period). Other characters are treated as blanks.  (Note especially that lowercase alphabetic characters are not available.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    LCHRS
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(an input expression of type INTEGER) is the number of characters in CHRS.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    ISIZE
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(an input expression of type INTEGER) specifies the character width to be used, defined in terms of the width of the plotter frame.  Because projected characters vary in width depending on just where they are placed within the box being viewed and the position from which that box is viewed, ISIZE is interpreted as specifying the width of a character when that character is positioned and viewed in such a way as to make it as large as it could possibly be - when the character is on the near side of the box and in a plane perpendicular to the line of sight.  Specifically,</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
      
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If between 0 and 3, ISIZE is 1., 1.5, 2., or 3. times a standard width equal to 1/128th of the screen width.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
      
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If greater than 3, ISIZE is the character width in units of 1/1024th of the plotter frame.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>
  <dt>
     
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>One third of the "width" referred to here is white space.  What ISIZE really specifies is the distance between the centers of adjacent characters in a string.  Characters are digitized to be 7/6 * ISIZE units high and 4/6 * ISIZE units wide, excluding white space.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    IDIR
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(an input expression of type INTEGER) is the direction in which the character string is to be written, as follows:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
      
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>1 = +U    -1 = -U</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
      
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>2 = +V    -2 = -V</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
      
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>3 = +W    -3 = -W</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    ITOP
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(an input expression of type INTEGER) is the direction from the center of the first character to the top of the first character; possible values of ITOP are the same as those of IDIR, above.  ABS(ITOP) must not be equal to ABS(IDIR).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    ICEN
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(an input expression of type INTEGER) is the centering option, specifying where (U,V,W) is relative to the string written, as follows:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    -1
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(U,V,W) is the center of the left edge of the first character.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
     0
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(U,V,W) is the center of the entire string.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
     1
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(U,V,W) is the center of the right edge of the last character.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>

</dl>
<p>Because characters drawn by PWRZT are stroked using the GKS polyline primitive (so that they can be projected from 3-D to 2-D), they are drawn in the current polyline color, as determined by the last call to the GKS routine GSPLCI; by default, color index 1 is used. Line width is determined by the last call to the GKS routine GSLWSC; by default, the line width scale factor is 1.</p>
