<p>The Direct3D 11 objects are acquired by the OpenCL context associated with <em>command-queue</em> and can therefore be used by all command-queues associated with the OpenCL context.</p><p>OpenCL memory objects created from Direct3D 11 resources must be acquired before they can be used by any OpenCL commands queued to a command-queue. If an OpenCL memory object created from a Direct3D 11 resource is used while it is not currently acquired by OpenCL, the call attempting to use that OpenCL memory object will return <strong>CL_D3D11_RESOURCE_NOT_ACQUIRED_KHR</strong>.</p><p>If <strong>CL_CONTEXT_INTEROP_USER_SYNC</strong> is not specified as <strong>CL_TRUE</strong> during context creation, <strong>clEnqueueAcquireD3D11ObjectsKHR</strong> provides the synchronization guarantee that any Direct3D 11 calls involving the interop device(s) used in the OpenCL context made before <strong>clEnqueueAcquireD3D11ObjectsKHR</strong> is called will complete executing before <em>event</em> reports completion and before the execution of any subsequent OpenCL work issued in <em>command_queue</em> begins. If the context was created with properties specifying <strong>CL_CONTEXT_INTEROP_USER_SYNC</strong> as <strong>CL_TRUE</strong>, the user is responsible for guaranteeing that any Direct3D 11 calls involving the interop device(s) used in the OpenCL context made before <strong>clEnqueueAcquireD3D11ObjectsKHR</strong> is called have completed before calling <strong>clEnqueueAcquireD3D11ObjectsKHR</strong>.</p><p>General information about sharing memory objects with Direct3D 11 follows.</p><p>The goal of this extension is to provide interoperability between OpenCL and Direct3D 11. This is designed to function analogously to the OpenGL interoperability. If this extension is supported by an implementation, the string <strong>cl_khr_d3d11_sharing</strong>(3clc) will be present in the <strong>CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS</strong> or <strong>CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS</strong> string described in the table of allowed values for <em>param_name</em> for <strong>clGetDeviceInfo</strong>(3clc).</p><p>As currently proposed the interfaces for this extension would be provided in cl_d3d11.h.</p><p>This section discusses OpenCL functions that allow applications to use Direct3D 11 resources as OpenCL memory objects. This allows efficient sharing of data between OpenCL and Direct3D 11. The OpenCL API may be used to execute kernels that read and/or write memory objects that are also Direct3D 11 resources. An OpenCL image object may be created from a Direct3D 11 texture resource. An OpenCL buffer object may be created from a Direct3D 11 buffer resource. OpenCL memory objects may be created from Direct3D 11 objects if and only if the OpenCL context has been created from a Direct3D 11 device.</p><p>An OpenCL memory object created from a Direct3D 11 resource remains valid as long as the corresponding Direct3D 11 resource has not been deleted. If the Direct3D 11 resource is deleted through the Direct3D 11 API, subsequent use of the OpenCL memory object will result in undefined behavior, including but not limited to possible OpenCL errors, data corruption, and program termination.</p><p>The successful creation of a cl_context against a Direct3D 11 device specified via the context create parameter <strong>CL_CONTEXT_D3D11_DEVICE_KHR</strong> will increment the internal Direct3D reference count on the specified Direct3D 11 device. The internal Direct3D reference count on that Direct3D 11 device will be decremented when the OpenCL reference count on the returned OpenCL context drops to zero.</p><p>The OpenCL context and corresponding command-queues are dependent on the existence of the Direct3D 11 device from which the OpenCL context was created. If the Direct3D 11 device is deleted through the Direct3D 11 API, subsequent use of the OpenCL context will result in undefined behavior, including but not limited to possible OpenCL errors, data corruption, and program termination.</p><p>Properties of Direct3D 11 objects may be queried using <strong>clGetMemObjectInfo</strong>(3clc) and <strong>clGetImageInfo</strong>(3clc) with <em>param_name</em><strong>CL_MEM_D3D11_RESOURCE_KHR</strong> and <strong>CL_IMAGE_D3D11_SUBRESOURCE_KHR</strong> as described for <strong>clGetImageInfo</strong>(3clc) and in the information below about accessing mapped regions of a memory object. Accessing mapped regions of a memory object.PP This section describes the behavior of OpenCL commands that access mapped regions of a memory object.</p><p>The contents of the region of a memory object and associated memory objects (sub-buffer objects or 1D image buffer objects that overlap this region) mapped for writing (i.e. <strong>CL_MAP_WRITE</strong> or <strong>CL_MAP_WRITE_INVALIDATE_REGION</strong> is set in <em>map_flags</em> argument to <strong>clEnqueueMapBuffer</strong>(3clc) or <strong>clEnqueueMapImage</strong>(3clc)) are considered to be undefined until this region is unmapped.</p><p>Multiple commands in command-queues can map a region or overlapping regions of a memory object and associated memory objects (sub-buffer objects or 1D image buffer objects that overlap this region) for reading (i.e. <em>map_flags</em> = <strong>CL_MAP_READ</strong>). The contents of the regions of a memory object mapped for reading can also be read by kernels and other OpenCL commands (such as <strong>clEnqueueCopyBuffer</strong>(3clc)) executing on a device(s).</p><p>Mapping (and unmapping) overlapped regions in a memory object and/or associated memory objects (sub-buffer objects or 1D image buffer objects that overlap this region) for writing is an error and will result in <strong>CL_INVALID_OPERATION</strong> error returned by <strong>clEnqueueMapBuffer</strong>(3clc) or <strong>clEnqueueMapImage</strong>(3clc).</p><p>If a memory object is currently mapped for writing, the application must ensure that the memory object is unmapped before any enqueued kernels or commands that read from or write to this memory object or any of its associated memory objects (sub-buffer or 1D image buffer objects) or its parent object (if the memory object is a sub-buffer or 1D image buffer object) begin execution; otherwise the behavior is undefined.</p><p>If a memory object is currently mapped for reading, the application must ensure that the memory object is unmapped before any enqueued kernels or commands that write to this memory object or any of its associated memory objects (sub-buffer or 1D image buffer objects) or its parent object (if the memory object is a sub-buffer or 1D image buffer object) begin execution; otherwise the behavior is undefined.</p><p>Accessing the contents of the memory region referred to by the mapped pointer that has been unmapped is undefined.</p><p>The mapped pointer returned by <strong>clEnqueueMapBuffer</strong>(3clc) or <strong>clEnqueueMapImage</strong>(3clc) can be used as <em>ptr</em> argument value to <strong>clEnqueueReadBuffer</strong>(3clc), <strong>clEnqueueWriteBuffer</strong>(3clc), <strong>clEnqueueReadBufferRect</strong>(3clc), <strong>clEnqueueWriteBufferRect</strong>(3clc), <strong>clEnqueueReadImage</strong>(3clc), and <strong>clEnqueueWriteImage</strong>(3clc), provided the rules described above are adhered to.</p>
