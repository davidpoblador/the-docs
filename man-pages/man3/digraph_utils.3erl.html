        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <em>digraph_utils</em> module implements some algorithms based on depth-first traversal of directed graphs. See the <em>digraph</em> module for basic functions on directed graphs.</p><p>A <em>directed graph</em> (or just "digraph") is a pair (V, E) of a finite set V of <em>vertices</em> and a finite set E of <em>directed edges</em> (or just "edges"). The set of edges E is a subset of V x V (the Cartesian product of V with itself).</p><p>Digraphs can be annotated with additional information. Such information may be attached to the vertices and to the edges of the digraph. A digraph which has been annotated is called a <em>labeled digraph</em>, and the information attached to a vertex or an edge is called a <em>label</em>.</p><p>An edge e = (v, w) is said to <em>emanate</em> from vertex v and to be <em>incident</em> on vertex w. If there is an edge emanating from v and incident on w, then w is said to be an <em>out-neighbour</em> of v, and v is said to be an <em>in-neighbour</em> of w. A <em>path</em> P from v[1] to v[k] in a digraph (V, E) is a non-empty sequence v[1], v[2], ..., v[k] of vertices in V such that there is an edge (v[i],v[i+1]) in E for 1 &lt;= i &lt; k. The <em>length</em> of the path P is k-1. P is a <em>cycle</em> if the length of P is not zero and v[1] = v[k]. A <em>loop</em> is a cycle of length one. An <em>acyclic digraph</em> is a digraph that has no cycles.</p><p>A <em>depth-first traversal</em> of a directed digraph can be viewed as a process that visits all vertices of the digraph. Initially, all vertices are marked as unvisited. The traversal starts with an arbitrarily chosen vertex, which is marked as visited, and follows an edge to an unmarked vertex, marking that vertex. The search then proceeds from that vertex in the same fashion, until there is no edge leading to an unvisited vertex. At that point the process backtracks, and the traversal continues as long as there are unexamined edges. If there remain unvisited vertices when all edges from the first vertex have been examined, some hitherto unvisited vertex is chosen, and the process is repeated.</p><p>A <em>partial ordering</em> of a set S is a transitive, antisymmetric and reflexive relation between the objects of S. The problem of <em>topological sorting</em> is to find a total ordering of S that is a superset of the partial ordering. A digraph G = (V, E) is equivalent to a relation E on V (we neglect the fact that the version of directed graphs implemented in the <em>digraph</em> module allows multiple edges between vertices). If the digraph has no cycles of length two or more, then the reflexive and transitive closure of E is a partial ordering.</p><p>A <em>subgraph</em> G' of G is a digraph whose vertices and edges form subsets of the vertices and edges of G. G' is <em>maximal</em> with respect to a property P if all other subgraphs that include the vertices of G' do not have the property P. A <em>strongly connected component</em> is a maximal subgraph such that there is a path between each pair of vertices. A <em>connected component</em> is a maximal subgraph such that there is a path between each pair of vertices, considering all edges undirected. An <em>arborescence</em> is an acyclic digraph with a vertex V, the <em>root</em>, such that there is a unique path from V to every other vertex of G. A <em>tree</em> is an acyclic non-empty digraph such that there is a unique path between every pair of vertices, considering all edges undirected.</p>
