<p>EOF state checking</p><p>This function is used by drivers that allow multiple outstanding reads at a time. It can only be called on behalf of a read operation (while in the read interface call or the pass_read callback).</p><p>Typical use for this would be to hold a driver specific lock (the same one used when calling <strong>globus_xio_driver_set_eof_received()</strong>) and call this to see if an EOF has been received. If so, the operation should immediately be finished with an EOF error (do not <em>return</em> an EOF error).</p><p>This call will typically only be used in the read interface call.</p><p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p><p><em>op</em> The operation structure representing the requested read operation.</p><p><strong>Returns:</strong></p><p>GLOBUS_TRUE if EOF received, GLOBUS_FALSE otherwise.</p>

<h3>void globus_xio_driver_finished_open (void *driver_handle, globus_xio_operation_top, globus_result_tresult)</h3>
<p>Driver API finished open</p><p>This function should be called to signal globus_xio that it has completed the open operation requested of it. It will free up resources associated with the op and potentially cause xio to pop the signal up the driver stack.</p><p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p><p><em>driver_handle</em> The driver specific handle pointer that will be passed to future interface function calls.</p><p><em>op</em> The requested open operation that has completed.</p><p><em>result</em> Return status of the completed operation</p>
<h3>void globus_xio_driver_finished_read (globus_xio_operation_top, globus_result_tresult, globus_size_tnread)</h3>

<p>Finishes an operation and merge two op structures. (XXX not implemented yet)</p><p>This function will join to operations together and signal globus_xio that it has completed. This is an advanced function. Most drivers will not require its use. This function takes an operation that was created by this driver and passed on to drivers lower on the stack and an operation that came in on the interface function (that has seen the top half of the stack) and joins them together. The purpose of this function is to join data descriptors that were pre-staged and cached with those that have later come in at the users request. See the read ahead doc for more information.</p><p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p><p><em>top_op</em> The operation that has seen the top part of the driver stack.</p><p><em>bottom_op</em> The operation that has seen the bottom part of the driver stack.</p><p>(result is always success in this case. if there is an error, use the other finish() call)</p>

<p>Driver API Create Operation</p><p>This function will create an operation from an initialized handle This operation can then be used for io operations related to the handle that created them.</p><p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p><p><em>operation</em> The operation to be created. When this function returns this structure will be populated and available for use for the driver.</p><p><em>handle</em> The initialized handle representing the user handle from which the operation will be created.</p>
<h3>globus_bool_t globus_xio_driver_operation_is_blocking (globus_xio_operation_toperation)</h3>
<p>Is Operation blocking.</p><p>If the operation is blocking the driver developer may be able to make certain optimizations. The function returns true if the given operation was created via a user call to a blocking function.</p>
<h3>globus_result_t globus_xio_driver_pass_close (globus_xio_operation_top, \fBglobus_xio_driver_callback_t\fPcb, void *user_arg)</h3>
<p>Driver API Close</p><p>This function will pass a close request down the driver stack. Upon completion of the close operation globus_xio will call the function pointed to by the cb argument.</p><p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p><p><em>op</em> The operation to pass along the driver stack for closing.</p><p><em>cb</em> A pointer to the function to be called once all drivers lower in the stack have closed.</p><p><em>user_arg</em> A user pointer that will be threaded through to the callback.</p>
<h3>globus_result_t globus_xio_driver_pass_open (globus_xio_operation_top, const globus_xio_contact_t *contact_info, \fBglobus_xio_driver_callback_t\fPcb, void *user_arg)</h3>
<p>Driver API Open</p><p>This function will pass an open request down the driver stack. Upon completion of the open operation globus_xio will call the <em>cb</em> function, at which point the handle structure will be initialized and available for use.</p><p>As soon as the function returns the handle is valid for creating other operations.</p><p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p><p><em>op</em> The operation from which the handle will be established. This parameter is used to determine what drivers are in the stack and other such information.</p><p><em>contact_info</em> The contact info describing the resource the driver below should open. This will normally be the same contact info that was passed in on the open interface.</p><p><em>cb</em> The function to be called when the open operation is complete.</p><p><em>user_arg</em> a user pointer that will be threaded through to the callback.</p>
<h3>globus_result_t globus_xio_driver_pass_read (globus_xio_operation_top, globus_xio_iovec_t *iovec, intiovec_count, globus_size_twait_for, \fBglobus_xio_driver_data_callback_t\fPcb, void *user_arg)</h3>
<p>Driver read</p><p>This function passes a read operation down the driver stack. After this function is called the op structure is no longer valid. However when the driver stack finishes servicing the read request it will pass a new operation structure in the function pointed to by cb. Finish read can be called on the new operation received.</p><p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p><p><em>op</em> The operation structure representing this requested io operation.</p><p><em>iovec</em> A pointer to the array of iovecs.</p><p><em>iovec_count</em> The number of iovecs in the array.</p><p><em>wait_for</em> The minimum number of bytes to read before returning. if a driver has no specifc requirement, he should use the user's request available via GlobusXIOOperationMinimumRead(op)</p><p><em>cb</em> The function to be called when the operation request is completed.</p><p><em>user_arg</em> A user pointer that will be threaded through to the callback.</p>
<h3>globus_result_t globus_xio_driver_pass_write (globus_xio_operation_top, globus_xio_iovec_t *iovec, intiovec_count, globus_size_twait_for, \fBglobus_xio_driver_data_callback_t\fPcb, void *user_arg)</h3>
<p>Driver write</p><p>This function passes a write operation down the driver stack. After this function is called the op structure is no longer valid. However when the driver stack finishes servicing the write request it will pass a new operation structure in the function pointed to by cb. Finished write can be called on the new operation received.</p><p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p><p><em>op</em> The operation structure representing this requested io operation.</p><p><em>iovec</em> A pointer to the array of iovecs.</p><p><em>iovec_count</em> The number of iovecs in the array.</p><p><em>wait_for</em> The minimum number of bytes to write before returning. If a driver has no specific requirement, he should use the user's request available via GlobusXIOOperationMinimumWrite(op)</p><p><em>cb</em> The function to be called when the operation request is completed.</p><p><em>user_arg</em> A user pointer that will be threaded through to the callback.</p>
<h3>void globus_xio_driver_set_eof_received (globus_xio_operation_top)</h3>
<p>EOF state manipulation</p><p>This function is used by drivers that allow multiple outstanding reads at a time. It can only be called on behalf of a read operation (while in the read interface call or the pass_read callback).</p><p>Typical use for this would be to hold a driver specific lock and call this when an internal EOF has been received. The read operation this is called on behalf of must be finished with an EOF error or the results are undefined.</p><p>In general, you should not have an EOF flag in your driver. Use this call and <strong>globus_xio_driver_eof_received()</strong> instead. This is necessary to support XIO's automatic EOF resetting. If your driver absolutely can not be read after an EOF has been set, then you will need your own EOF flag.</p><p>This call will typically only be used just before a finished_read() call.</p><p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p><p><em>op</em> The operation structure representing the requested read operation.</p>
