        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>If a package directory contains a file with the fixed name "META" it  is interpreted as described here. The file is a sequence of entries  following the given grammar; every entry defines a variable under a  certain condition given by the list of formal predicates, or it  introduces a subpackage. .PP There is a list of predefined variables and a list of standard  predicates. These variables define: required packages, description, version  information, directories, archive files, and linker options. The  predicates denote circumstances of the application of the variables:  whether the bytecode or the native compiler is used, if there is a  toploop compiled in, details of multi-threading execution, details of  profiling.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DETAILS OF THE FILE FORMAT</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The file consists of a sequence of entries which must be formed as the  grammar prescribes. The lexical tokens are names, values, and  interpunctuation like '(', ',' and so on. Note that linefeeds do not  play a special role, i.e. an entry definition may be given in more than  one line, or several definitions may occur on a single line. There may  be comments which begin with '#' and run until the end of the line. .PP Names are sequences of the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _. Names  containing capital letters and names beginning with digits are  allowed but not recommended. .PP Values are enclosed between double quotes. Values may contain any  character. The characters " and &#92; must be preceded by backslashes.</p><p>Package names must not contain the '.' character because it is used  as delimiter of compound names. .SH "MAIN PACKAGES AND SUBPACKAGES" The outermost variable assignments and additions belong to the main  package. The name of the main package is not defined within META;  it is either the name of the directory containing META or the suffix  of the META file (if the name of the META file is formed like  META.name). .PP The keyword package  starts the definition  of a subpackage. There must not be two such definitions with the  same name. Within the parantheses, the variable assignments and  additions refer to the subpackage. It is allowed that a subpackage  contains further subpackages. .PP The package name following package  is the local name relative to the main package, i.e. the  name of the main package is not mentioned. At all other places,  however, the subpackage must be prefixed by the name of the  containing package, separated by a '.'. .PP Subpackages are independent of the containing package, except  that the subpackage points to the same installation directory as  the containing package (i.e. the location of the installation directory  is inherited from the containing package). .SH "SEMANTICS OF VARIABLE DEFINITIONS" In order to determine the value of a variable, first all assignments  are inspected, and the most specific assignment is taken (if there is  none, the empty string will be taken as value). In a second step,  all additions are gone through one after the other in the order  they occur in the file, and the values of all matching additions are  appended to the current value. In the following, it is further  clarified which assignment is the most specific, which additions  actually match, and how the details of the value addition look like. .PP The most specific assignment is selected upon a set of actual  predicates, i.e. the set of predicates that are assumed to be true.  The predicates occuring in the definitions of assignments and  additions are called formal predicates. They may be positive or  negative; the latter are prepended by a '-' sign. In order to  determine the value after the evaluation of the assignments, the  following rules apply:</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R An assignment can only be used if all positive formal  predicates are included in the set of actual predicates, and if all  negative formal predicates are not included in the set of actual  predicates. Such an assignment is called  applicable .ft R . If there is no such assignment, the  variable will have no value.</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R If there is more than one applicable assignment, the definition with  the biggest number of formal predicates is selected. .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R If there is still more than one applicable assignment, both applicable</p><p>and with a maximum number of formal predicates, the definition that is defined  first is selected. .RE</p><p>An addition is matching when all positive formal predicates are  included in the set of actual predicates, and all negative formal  predicates are not included. .PP The value of an addition is appended to the current value with  implicit white space as separator. .SH "VARIABLES" There is a set of variables with predefined meaning: .PP</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The  variable "directory" redefines the location of the package  directory. Normally, the META file is the first file read in the  package directory, and before any other file is read, the "directory"  variable is evaluated in order to see if the package directory must be  changed. The value of the "directory" variable is determined with an  empty set of actual predicates. The value must be either: an absolute  path name of the alternate directory, or a path name relative to the  stdlib directory of OCaml (written "+path"), or a normal relative path  name (without special syntax). In the latter case, the interpretation  depends on whether it is contained in a main or sub package, and  whether the standard repository layout or the alternate layout is in  effect (see site-lib  for these terms).  For a main package in standard layout the base directory is the  directory physically containing the META file, and the relative path  is interpreted for this base directory. For a main package in  alternate layout the base directory is the directory physically  containing the META.pkg files. The base directory for subpackages is  the package directory of the containing package. (In the case  that a subpackage definition does not have a "directory" setting,  the subpackage simply inherits the package directory of the containing  package. By writing a "directory" directive one can change this  location again.) .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The variable "requires" specifies the list of required packages. The  names of the packages must be separated by white space and/or commas.  The names must be fully qualified (i.e. when they refer to a subpackage,  the names of all containing packages must be prepended, separated by  '.'). .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The variable "description" may include a short description of the  package (displayed by ocamlfind list ). .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The variable "version" specifies the version string. .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The variable "archive" specifies the list of archive files. These  files should be given either as (1) plain names without any directory  information; they are only searched in the package directory.  (2) Or they have the form "+path" in which case the files are looked up  relative to the standard library. (3) Or they have the form "@name/file"  in which case the files are looked up in the package directory  of another package. (4) Or they are given as absolute paths. .PP The  names of the files must be separated by white space and/or commas.  In the preprocessor stage, the archive files are passed as extensions  to the preprocessor (camlp4) call. In the linker stage (-linkpkg), the archive  files are linked. In the compiler stage, the archive files are ignored. .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The variable "linkopts" specifies additional linker options. .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The variable "error" can be used to signal error conditions. When  this variable is applicable, the ocaml compilers are stopped, and  an error message is printed. The message is the value of the variable. .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The variable "exists_if" can be used to disable subpackages. The  value of "exists_if" is a file; the subpackage is hidden if this  file does not exist. You can also enumerate several files, and the  subpackage is hidden if none of the files exist. .RE</p><p>It is possible to define additional variables but there is currently  no software interpreting them. .SH "PREDICATES" There is a list of standard predicates: .PP</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The "byte" predicate means that the bytecode compiler is used. .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The "native" predicate means that the native compiler is used. .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The "toploop" predicate means that the toploop is available in the  linked program. It is only set when the toploop is running, not when  the toploop is generated. .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The "create_toploop" predicate means that a toploop is created (using  ocamlmktop). .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The "mt" predicate means that the program is multi-threaded. .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The "mt_posix" predicate means that in the case "mt" is set, too, the  POSIX libraries are used to implement threads. .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The "mt_vm" predicate means that in the case "mt" is set, too, the  VM-based libraries are used to implement threads. .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The "gprof" predicate means that in the case "native" is set, too, the  program is compiled for profiling .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The "autolink" predicate means that ocamlc can/will perform automatic linking. .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The "preprocessor" predicate means that the META variables are scanned for  preprocessor options. .RE</p><p>\h'-3m'\z&bull;\h'3m' .ft R The "syntax" predicate means that the -syntax option is present on the  command line. .RE</p><p>In addition to these predicates, there are package predicates  for every package that is finally selected. Of course, this kind of  predicate must not be used to select "directory" and "requires"  variables, but for the other variables they are perfectly valid.  The package predicates have the form "pkg_" plus the name of the </p>
