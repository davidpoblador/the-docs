        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Files in the <strong>log</strong> directory in the \*(Fx spooling area contain logging/tracing information about transmit and receive sessions. One file exists for each inbound or outbound call, with the filename of the form ``cXXXXXXXX'' where XXXXXXXX is a decimal sequence number termed a <em>communication identifier</em>. The amount and kind of tracing information that is recorded for a call is defined by the <strong>SessionTracing</strong> parameter specified in the modem configuration file; see <a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html"><strong>hylafax-config</strong>(5)</a>.</p><p>Note that logging/tracing information generated by the server outside of a session is directed to the <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html"><strong>syslog</strong>(3)</a> service and is controlled by the <strong>LogFacility</strong> and <strong>ServerTracing</strong> parameters specified in the modem configuration file.</p><p>[<strong>NB: The remainder of this manual page is out of date.</strong>]</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">SERVER OPERATION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The following messages may appear when server operation tracing (bit 1) is enabled:</p><p><strong>MODEM: Unknown type "%s" ignored</strong>. The <strong>ModemType</strong> configuration parameter was not recognized.</p><p><strong>MODEM %s %s/%s</strong>. This message is generated each time the modem is reset and made ready for use.</p><p><strong>%s: Can not lock device.</strong>. The <small>UUCP</small> lockfile for the modem could not be created because another process has a lockfile already in place.</p><p><strong>%s: Can not open modem (%m)</strong>. <a href="../man2/open.2.html"><strong>open</strong>(2)</a> on the special device file for the modem failed; the error status is presented; c.f. <a href="../man2/intro.2.html"><strong>intro</strong>(2)</a>.</p><p><strong>%s: Can not open modem (timed out).</strong>. <a href="../man2/open.2.html"><strong>open</strong>(2)</a> on the special device file blocked and was timed out. This typically is because the system does not support a non-blocking mechanism for opening the device and the presented interface requires that carrier be present before the open can succeed.</p><p><strong>%s: setuid root failed (%m)</strong>. The server process was unable to establish root privileges. This is usually caused by server being improperly installed.</p><p><strong>%s: fcntl: %m</strong>. The server was unable to turn off the <small>O_NDELAY</small> bit on the open modem file descriptor after doing a non-blocking open of the modem device special file.</p><p><strong>schedctl: %m</strong>. (<em>Only on Silicon Graphics systems.</em>) A <strong>schedctl</strong>(2) system call to set the server process priority failed.</p><p><strong>sched policy=%d, priority=%d</strong>. (<em>Only on POSIX compliant systems.</em>) Describes a <strong>setscheduler</strong>(2) system call to enhance real-time job scheduling.</p><p><strong>Unable to set %s scheduling parameters: %m</strong>. (<em>Only on \s-1SVR4\s+1-style systems.</em>) A <em>priocntl</em> system call to set the server process priority failed.</p><p><strong>priocntl(%s): %m</strong>. (<em>Only on \s-1SVR4\s+1-style systems.</em>) A <em>priocntl</em> system call to get the current process scheduling information failed.</p><p><strong>sched policy=%d, priority=%d</strong>. (<em>Only on POSIX-compliant systems.</em>) Indicates a possible change in the system job scheduling due to use of <strong>PriorityScheduling</strong></p><p><strong>%s: Can not deduce modem type.</strong>. The server was unable to reset and initialize the modem. This can be caused by many things: wrong device filename, improper cabling, incorrect modem type, incorrect modem configuration, etc.</p><p><strong>RECV: Permission denied (unacceptable client TSI)</strong>. A receive request was denied because the client was denied access through the <small>TSI</small> access control list mechanism; c.f. <a href="../man5/tsi.5.html"><strong>tsi</strong>(5)</a>.</p><p><strong>RECV: Unable to create file "%s" for received data</strong>. The server was unable to create a file for writing the received facsimile data. Check the permission on the <strong>recvq</strong> subdirectory. Beware also that the server uses <a href="../man3/tempnam.3.html"><strong>tempnam</strong>(3)</a> to create these files and the presence of the <small>TMPDIR</small> environment variable may cause the server to try to create files in a directory other than the <strong>recvq</strong> directory.</p><p><strong>RECV data in "%s"</strong>. This is an information message; the received facsimile is being placed in the specified filename.</p><p><strong>RECV: empty file "%s" deleted</strong>. A receive operation terminated without any good pages being received; consequently the empty file is deleted.</p><p><strong>ACCEPT TSI "%s"</strong>. The <small>TSI</small> received during a receive operation was accepted and the receive will continue.</p><p><strong>REJECT TSI "%s"</strong>. The <small>TSI</small> received during a receive operation was rejected and the receive will be aborted at the next opportunity.</p><p><strong>POLL: Unable to create file "%s" for received data</strong>. The server was unable to create a file for the polled data. See also above under ``<strong>RECV: Unable...</strong>''.</p><p><strong>POLL: empty file "%s" deleted</strong>. A poll operation terminated without any good pages being received; consequently the empty file is deleted.</p><p><strong>internal muckup, lost polling request</strong>. This message should not appear; it indicates the server went to do a poll but did not find the user-specified poll request in its job description; c.f. <a href="../man5/sendq.5.html"><strong>sendq</strong>(5)</a>.</p><p><strong>SEND FAILED: %s</strong>. A transmission failed for the reason shown.</p><p><strong>SEND: Can not open document file "%s", dirnum %d</strong>. The server was unable to open the <small>TIFF</small> document file that was to be transmitted.</p><p><strong>SEND: Can not set directory in document file "%s", dirnum %d</strong>. The server was unable to access the <small>TIFF</small> directory associated with the next page to transmit. The document file and directory number for the page are shown.</p><p><strong>SEND: %s "%s", dirnum %d</strong>. A transmission failed because three attempts were made to transmit the same page.  The full reason for the failure is displayed along with the document filename and directory number of the page that failed.</p><p><strong>SEND: Document is not in a Group 3-compatible format (file %s, compression %d)</strong>. The <small>TIFF</small> document submitted for transmission was not was not compressed with <small>CCITT T.4</small> compression; the <small>TIFF</small> compression code number is shown. This is treated as a fatal error and the job is aborted.</p><p><strong>REJECT: Document was encoded with 2DMR, but client does not support this data format</strong>. The document to be transmitted was encoded using the optional <small>2DMR</small> form of the <small>CCITT T.4</small> standard, but the client capabilities indicate this data format is not supported. This is not a fatal error; the server will disconnect and reimage the document using <small>1DMH</small> encoding.</p><p><strong>REJECT: Client does not support document page width, max remote page width %u, image width %lu</strong>. The document to be transmitted was imaged using a page width that is not supported by the client. This is not a fatal error; the server will disconnect and reimage the document using the newly discovered client capabilities.</p><p><strong>REJECT: High resolution document is not supported by client, image resolution %g line/mm</strong>. The document to be transmitted was imaged using 7 line/mm, but the client only supports 3.85 line/mm. This is not a fatal error; the server will disconnect and reimage the document using the newly discovered client capabilities.</p><p><strong>REJECT: Client does not support document page length, max remote page length %d mm, image length %lu rows (%.2f mm)</strong>. The document to be transmitted was imaged using a page length that is not supported by the client. This is not a fatal error; the server will disconnect and reimage the document using the newly discovered client capabilities.</p><p><strong>ABORT: job abort requested</strong>. The server received a request on a command <small>FIFO</small> file to abort the current send/receive job.</p><p><strong>ANSWER: Can not lock modem device</strong>. The server went to answer an incoming call, but found the device locked for use by another process. This is the usual scenario that takes place when an outbound call is made through the modem: the echo from data written to the modem causes the fax server to wakeup, only to discover the <small>UUCP</small> lockfile for the outgoing call. The fax server will discard its handle on the modem and wait for the lockfile to be removed.</p><p><strong>ANSWER: FAX CONNECTION</strong>. The server is initiating service for an incoming facsimile call.</p><p><strong>ANSWER: DATA CONNECTION</strong>. The server is initiating service for an incoming data call.</p><p><strong>ANSWER: Data connections are not permitted</strong>. The server rejected an incoming data call because the configured <strong>GettyArgs</strong> parameter is null.</p><p><strong>ANSWER: Could not switch modem to data service</strong>. The server was unable to initiate service for an incoming data call because of some problem in setting up the modem for data use.</p><p><strong>ANSWER: VOICE CONNECTION</strong>. The server is initiating service for an incoming voice call.</p><p><strong>ANSWER: Could not switch modem to voice service</strong>. The server was unable to initiate service for an incoming voice call because of some problem in setting up the modem for voice use.</p><p><strong>ANSWER: %s</strong>. An error was detected by the modem layer while setting up an incoming call.</p><p><strong>GETTY: could not create</strong>. The server was unable to create an internal data structure used to track a getty process.</p><p><strong>GETTY: can not fork</strong>. The server was unable to <a href="../man2/fork.2.html"><strong>fork</strong>(2)</a> a new process in order to startup the getty program.</p><p><strong>runGetty::setregid: %m</strong>.</p><p><strong>runGetty::setreuid: %m</strong>. The server was unable to change the process identity before starting up the getty program.</p><p><strong>GETTY: start pid %u, "%s"</strong>. The server has started up a getty program to service the incoming data call. The getty process identifier is displayed along with the arguments passed to the program.</p><p><strong>GETTY: terminated, exit status %#o</strong>. The server has reaped a getty process which it started up.</p><p><strong>Parse error in dial string rules "%s"</strong>. The dial string rules in the specified file contain a syntax error. The <a href="../man8/dialtest.8.html"><strong>dialtest</strong>(8)</a> program should be used to debug the problem.</p><p><strong>Unknown answer type "%s"</strong>. The <strong>AnswerRotary</strong> configuration parameter has an invalid answer type string; consult <a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html"><strong>hylafax-config</strong>(5)</a>.</p><p><strong>Syntax error, missing ':' in "%s"</strong>.</p><p><strong>Syntax error, missing quote mark in "%s"</strong>.</p><p><strong>Unknown configuration parameter "%s" ignored</strong>.

The Class 2 modem driver encountered an error parsing the displayed session capabilities string. This is usually due to a communication problem between host and modem (though it can also be caused by bogus modem firmware).</p><p><strong>MODEM protocol botch: OK without +FPTS:</strong>. The Class 2 modem driver encountered an error in the host-modem protocol for receiving facsimile. While waiting for the post-page status (``\s-1+FPTS:\s+1''), an ``\s-1OK\s+1'' result was received first. This should never happen.</p><p><strong>MODEM protocol botch: +FET: without +FPTS:</strong>. The Class 2 modem driver encountered an error in the host-modem protocol for receiving facsimile. While waiting for the post-page status (``\s-1+FPTS:\s+1''), a ``\s-1+FET:\s+1'' status message was received first. This should never happen.</p><p><strong>POLL with CIG "%s"</strong>.

During a receive operation the specified number of bytes of facsimile data were received for the current page.</p><p><strong>RECV: %lu bytes, %lu total rows</strong>. During a receive operation the specified number of bytes of facsimile data were received. The current running total of rows in the current page being received is also displayed.</p><p><strong>RECV: %s (begin)</strong>. The specified error message occurred when initiating the receive operation.</p><p><strong>RECV: %s (end)</strong>. The specified error message occurred while terminating the receive operation.</p><p><strong>RECV: TCF %u bytes, %u%% non-zero, %u zero-run</strong>. When receiving training, the received <small>TCF</small> had the specified number of bytes of which a certain percentage was non-zero and the longest consecutive run of zero data was found.</p><p><strong>RECV: reject TCF (too many non-zero, max %u%%)</strong>. The received <small>TCF</small> was deemed unacceptable because there was too high a percentage of non-zero data in it. The <strong>Class1TCFMaxNonZero</strong> configuration parameter controls this decision.</p><p><strong>RECV: reject TCF (zero run too short, min %u)</strong>. The received <small>TCF</small> was deemed unacceptable because the longest run of zero data was too short. The <strong>Class1TCFMinZero</strong> configuration parameter controls this decision.</p><p><strong>RECV: bad code word 0x%x, len %d, row %lu</strong>.</p><p><strong>RECV: begin page</strong>. During a receive operation a new page of data is about to received on the high speed message carrier.</p><p><strong>RECV: end page</strong>.

The server did not receive &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; to signal the end of a page of facsimile data during a page receive operation.</p><p><strong>REMOTE supports \*(Ps transfer</strong>.</p><p><strong>REMOTE does not support \*(Ps transfer</strong>. The peer does or does not support the Adobe \*(Ps transfer extensions to the <small>T.30</small> protocol.</p><p><strong>RECV: Missing EOL after 5 seconds</strong>. The server timed out while receiving page data. This typically is caused by a flow control configuration problem that causes data from the modem to the host to be stopped.</p><p><strong>RECV: %u bytes of data, %lu total lines</strong>. While receiving page data, %u bytes of raw data were received; the current total number of rows in the page are also displayed.</p><p><strong>RECV: %lu bad lines %lu consecutive bad lines</strong>. After the completion of a page receive, the total number of rows received in error and the maximum consecutive rows that were received in error are printed. These numbers should always be zero unless copy quality checking is done in the host.</p><p><strong>RECV received %u frames of block %u of page %u</strong>. When the server does Class 1 ECM; a complete block has been received with a given number of frames for a named page.</p><p><strong>RECV received assumed RCP frame with block end</strong>. When the server does Class 1 ECM; the block-end indicator was received without a proper RCP frame and the receipt of an RCP frame was therefore assumed or feigned.</p><p><strong>RECV received frame number %u</strong>. When the server does Class 1 ECM; the numbered image frame has been received.</p><p><strong>RECV received RCP frame</strong>. When the server does Class 1 ECM; the first RCP frame was received, which signifies the end of the image block.</p><p><strong>RECV: REJECT page quality, %u%% good lines (%u%% required)</strong>. When the server does copy quality checking; the received page is deemed to have unacceptable quality because the percentage of good rows in the page is too low. This check is controlled by the <strong>PercentGoodLines</strong> configuration parameter.</p><p><strong>RECV: REJECT page quality, %u-line run (max %u)</strong>. When the server does copy quality checking; the received page is deemed to have unacceptable quality because the maximum consecutive rows that were received in error exceeds the threshold specified by the <strong>MaxBadLines</strong> configuration parameter.</p><p><strong>RECV sent fourth PPR</strong>. During Class 1 ECM; the server has rejected a received image block consecutively four times at which point the sender is allowed to either continue to retransmit the block or to end retransmissions.</p><p><strong>REMOTE HANGUP: %s (code %s)</strong>. The modem returned a hangup status code (``\s-1+FHNG:\s+1'' or ``\s-1+FHS:\s+1'') to the host. This indicates a protocol problem that was determined <strong>within the modem</strong>; there is usually nothing that the server can do to work around such errors.</p><p><strong>REMOTE TSI "%s"</strong>. During a receive operation, the specified <small>TSI</small> was received. This string is checked against the <small>TSI</small> access control list described in <a href="../man5/tsi.5.html"><strong>tsi</strong>(5)</a>.</p><p><strong>REMOTE best format %s</strong>. The peers' ``best'' data format according to the received <small>DIS</small> frame. ``Best'' here is based on the belief that <small>2DMMR</small> data is better than <small>2DMR</small> with optional uncompressed data, is better than <small>2DMR</small> data, is better than <small>1DMH</small> data.</p><p><strong>REMOTE best rate %s</strong>.

Likewise, on output <small>XON/XOFF</small> characters are either <em>disabled</em> (not generated by the terminal driver), or <em>generated</em> (by the terminal driver to effect flow control of data from the modem to the host).</p><p><strong>MODEM input buffering enabled</strong>.</p><p><strong>MODEM input buffering disabled</strong>. On systems that buffer input data in the operating system before delivering it to applications the server will enable and disable buffering as best it can in those cases where low input latency is critical.</p><p><strong>TIMEOUT: %s</strong>.
