      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The <em>proc</em> filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to kernel data structures. It is commonly mounted at <em>/proc</em>. Most of it is read-only, but some files allow kernel variables to be changed.</p><p>The following list describes many of the files and directories under the <em>/proc</em> hierarchy.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There is a numerical subdirectory for each running process; the subdirectory is named by the process ID. Each such subdirectory contains the following pseudo-files and directories.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/auxv</em> (since 2.6.0-test7)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This contains the contents of the ELF interpreter information passed to the process at exec time. The format is one <em>unsigned long</em> ID plus one <em>unsigned long</em> value for each entry. The last entry contains two zeros. See also <a href="../man3/getauxval.3.html"><strong>getauxval</strong>(3)</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/cgroup</em> (since Linux 2.6.24)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This file describes control groups to which the process/task belongs. For each cgroup hierarchy there is one entry containing colon-separated fields of the form:</p>
<pre>
    5:cpuacct,cpu,cpuset:/daemons
</pre>
<ul>
<li><p>The colon-separated fields are, from left to right:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    1.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>hierarchy ID number</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    2.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>set of subsystems bound to the hierarchy</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    3.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>control group in the hierarchy to which the process belongs</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
</li><li><p>This file is present only if the <strong>CONFIG_CGROUPS</strong> kernel configuration option is enabled.</p></li>
</ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/clear_refs</em> (since Linux 2.6.22)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a write-only file, writable only by owner of the process.</p><p>The following values may be written to the file:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>1 (since Linux 2.6.22)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Reset the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits for all the pages associated with the process. (Before kernel 2.6.32, writing any nonzero value to this file had this effect.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>2 (since Linux 2.6.32)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Reset the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits for all anonymous pages associated with the process.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>3 (since Linux 2.6.32)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Reset the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits for all file-mapped pages associated with the process.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<ul>
<li><p>Clearing the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits provides a method to measure approximately how much memory a process is using. One first inspects the values in the "Referenced" fields for the VMAs shown in <em>/proc/[pid]/smaps</em> to get an idea of the memory footprint of the process. One then clears the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits and, after some measured time interval, once again inspects the values in the "Referenced" fields to get an idea of the change in memory footprint of the process during the measured interval. If one is interested only in inspecting the selected mapping types, then the value 2 or 3 can be used instead of 1.</p><p>A further value can be written to affect a different bit:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p>4 (since Linux 3.11)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Clear the soft-dirty bit for all the pages associated with the process. This is used (in conjunction with <em>/proc/[pid]/pagemap</em>) by the check-point restore system to discover which pages of a process have been dirtied since the file <em>/proc/[pid]/clear_refs</em> was written to.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
</li><li><p>Writing any value to <em>/proc/[pid]/clear_refs</em> other than those listed above has no effect.</p><p>The <em>/proc/[pid]/clear_refs</em> file is present only if the <strong>CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR</strong> kernel configuration option is enabled.</p></li>
</ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/cmdline</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This read-only file holds the complete command line for the process, unless the process is a zombie. In the latter case, there is nothing in this file: that is, a read on this file will return 0 characters. The command-line arguments appear in this file as a set of strings separated by null bytes (&apos;&#92;0&apos;), with a further null byte after the last string.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/comm</em> (since Linux 2.6.33)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This file exposes the process's <em>comm</em> value&ndash;that is, the command name associated with the process. Different threads in the same process may have different <em>comm</em> values, accessible via <em>/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/comm</em>. A thread may modify its <em>comm</em> value, or that of any of other thread in the same thread group (see the discussion of <strong>CLONE_THREAD</strong> in <a href="../man2/clone.2.html"><strong>clone</strong>(2)</a>), by writing to the file <em>/proc/self/task/[tid]/comm</em>. Strings longer than <strong>TASK_COMM_LEN</strong> (16) characters are silently truncated.</p><p>This file provides a superset of the <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html"><strong>prctl</strong>(2)</a> <strong>PR_SET_NAME</strong> and <strong>PR_GET_NAME</strong> operations, and is employed by <a href="../man3/pthread_setname_np.3.html"><strong>pthread_setname_np</strong>(3)</a> when used to rename threads other than the caller.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/coredump_filter</em> (since Linux 2.6.23)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>See <a href="../man5/core.5.html"><strong>core</strong>(5)</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/cpuset</em> (since Linux 2.6.12)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>See <a href="../man7/cpuset.7.html"><strong>cpuset</strong>(7)</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/cwd</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a symbolic link to the current working directory of the process. To find out the current working directory of process 20, for instance, you can do this:</p>
<pre>
$<strong> cd /proc/20/cwd; /bin/pwd</strong>
</pre>
<p>Note that the <em>pwd</em> command is often a shell built-in, and might not work properly. In <a href="../man1/bash.1.html"><strong>bash</strong>(1)</a>, you may use <em>pwd&nbsp;-P</em>.</p><p>In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link are not available if the main thread has already terminated (typically by calling <a href="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html"><strong>pthread_exit</strong>(3)</a>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/environ</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This file contains the environment for the process. The entries are separated by null bytes (&apos;&#92;0&apos;), and there may be a null byte at the end. Thus, to print out the environment of process 1, you would do:</p>
<pre>
$<strong> strings /proc/1/environ</strong>
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/exe</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Under Linux 2.2 and later, this file is a symbolic link containing the actual pathname of the executed command. This symbolic link can be dereferenced normally; attempting to open it will open the executable. You can even type <em>/proc/[pid]/exe</em> to run another copy of the same executable as is being run by process [pid]. In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link are not available if the main thread has already terminated (typically by calling <a href="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html"><strong>pthread_exit</strong>(3)</a>).</p><p>Under Linux 2.0 and earlier, <em>/proc/[pid]/exe</em> is a pointer to the binary which was executed, and appears as a symbolic link. A <a href="../man2/readlink.2.html"><strong>readlink</strong>(2)</a> call on this file under Linux 2.0 returns a string in the format:</p>
<pre>
    [device]:inode
</pre>
<p>For example, [0301]:1502 would be inode 1502 on device major 03 (IDE, MFM, etc. drives) minor 01 (first partition on the first drive).</p><p><a href="../man1/find.1.html"><strong>find</strong>(1)</a> with the <em>-inum</em> option can be used to locate the file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/fd/</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the process has open, named by its file descriptor, and which is a symbolic link to the actual file. Thus, 0 is standard input, 1 standard output, 2 standard error, and so on.</p><p>For file descriptors for pipes and sockets, the entries will be symbolic links whose content is the file type with the inode. A <a href="../man2/readlink.2.html"><strong>readlink</strong>(2)</a> call on this file returns a string in the format:</p>
<pre>
    type:[inode]
</pre>
<p>For example, <em>socket:[2248868]</em> will be a socket and its inode is 2248868. For sockets, that inode can be used to find more information in one of the files under <em>/proc/net/</em>.</p><p>For file descriptors that have no corresponding inode (e.g., file descriptors produced by <a href="../man2/epoll_create.2.html"><strong>epoll_create</strong>(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/eventfd.2.html"><strong>eventfd</strong>(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/inotify_init.2.html"><strong>inotify_init</strong>(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/signalfd.2.html"><strong>signalfd</strong>(2)</a>, and <strong>timerfd</strong>(2)), the entry will be a symbolic link with contents of the form</p>
<pre>
    anon_inode:&lt;file-type&gt;
</pre>
<p>In some cases, the <em>file-type</em> is surrounded by square brackets.</p><p>For example, an epoll file descriptor will have a symbolic link whose content is the string <em>anon_inode:[eventpoll]</em>.</p><p>In a multithreaded process, the contents of this directory are not available if the main thread has already terminated (typically by calling <a href="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html"><strong>pthread_exit</strong>(3)</a>).</p><p>Programs that will take a filename as a command-line argument, but will not take input from standard input if no argument is supplied, or that write to a file named as a command-line argument, but will not send their output to standard output if no argument is supplied, can nevertheless be made to use standard input or standard out using <em>/proc/[pid]/fd</em>. For example, assuming that <em>-i</em> is the flag designating an input file and <em>-o</em> is the flag designating an output file:</p>
<pre>
$<strong> foobar -i /proc/self/fd/0 -o /proc/self/fd/1 ...</strong>
</pre>
<p>and you have a working filter.</p><p><em>/proc/self/fd/N</em> is approximately the same as <em>/dev/fd/N</em> in some UNIX and UNIX-like systems. Most Linux MAKEDEV scripts symbolically link <em>/dev/fd</em> to <em>/proc/self/fd</em>, in fact.</p><p>Most systems provide symbolic links <em>/dev/stdin</em>, <em>/dev/stdout</em>, and <em>/dev/stderr</em>, which respectively link to the files <em>0</em>, <em>1</em>, and <em>2</em> in <em>/proc/self/fd</em>. Thus the example command above could be written as:</p>
<pre>
$<strong> foobar -i /dev/stdin -o /dev/stdout ...</strong>
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/fdinfo/</em> (since Linux 2.6.22)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the process has open, named by its file descriptor. The contents of each file can be read to obtain information about the corresponding file descriptor, for example:</p>
<pre>
$<strong> cat /proc/12015/fdinfo/4</strong>
pos:    1000
flags:  01002002
</pre>
<p>The <em>pos</em> field is a decimal number showing the current file offset. The <em>flags</em> field is an octal number that displays the file access mode and file status flags (see <a href="../man2/open.2.html"><strong>open</strong>(2)</a>).</p><p>The files in this directory are readable only by the owner of the process.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/io</em> (since kernel 2.6.20)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This file contains I/O statistics for the process, for example:</p>
<pre>
#<strong> cat /proc/3828/io</strong>
rchar: 323934931
wchar: 323929600
syscr: 632687
syscw: 632675
read_bytes: 0
write_bytes: 323932160
cancelled_write_bytes: 0
</pre>
<p>The fields are as follows:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><em>rchar</em>: characters read</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The number of bytes which this task has caused to be read from storage. This is simply the sum of bytes which this process passed to <a href="../man2/read.2.html"><strong>read</strong>(2)</a> and similar system calls. It includes things such as terminal I/O and is unaffected by whether or not actual physical disk I/O was required (the read might have been satisfied from pagecache).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>wchar</em>: characters written</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The number of bytes which this task has caused, or shall cause to be written to disk. Similar caveats apply here as with <em>rchar</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>syscr</em>: read syscalls</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Attempt to count the number of read I/O operations&ndash;that is, system calls such as <a href="../man2/read.2.html"><strong>read</strong>(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/pread.2.html"><strong>pread</strong>(2)</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>syscw</em>: write syscalls</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Attempt to count the number of write I/O operations&ndash;that is, system calls such as <a href="../man2/write.2.html"><strong>write</strong>(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/pwrite.2.html"><strong>pwrite</strong>(2)</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>read_bytes</em>: bytes read</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Attempt to count the number of bytes which this process really did cause to be fetched from the storage layer. This is accurate for block-backed filesystems.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>write_bytes</em>: bytes written</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Attempt to count the number of bytes which this process caused to be sent to the storage layer.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>cancelled_write_bytes</em>:</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The big inaccuracy here is truncate. If a process writes 1MB to a file and then deletes the file, it will in fact perform no writeout. But it will have been accounted as having caused 1MB of write. In other words: this field represents the number of bytes which this process caused to not happen, by truncating pagecache. A task can cause "negative" I/O too. If this task truncates some dirty pagecache, some I/O which another task has been accounted for (in its <em>write_bytes</em>) will not be happening.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Note</em>: In the current implementation, things are a bit racy on 32-bit systems: if process A reads process B's <em>/proc/[pid]/io</em> while process B is updating one of these 64-bit counters, process A could see an intermediate result.</p></li>
</ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/gid_map</em> (since Linux 3.5)</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/limits</em> (since Linux 2.6.24)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This file displays the soft limit, hard limit, and units of measurement for each of the process's resource limits (see <a href="../man2/getrlimit.2.html"><strong>getrlimit</strong>(2)</a>). Up to and including Linux 2.6.35, this file is protected to allow reading only by the real UID of the process. Since Linux 2.6.36, this file is readable by all users on the system.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><em>/proc/[pid]/map_files/</em> (since kernel 3.3)</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This subdirectory contains entries corresponding to memory-mapped files (see <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html"><strong>mmap</strong>(2)</a>). Entries are named by memory region start and end address pair (expressed as hexadecimal numbers), and are symbolic links to the mapped files themselves. Here is an example, with the output wrapped and reformatted to fit on an 80-column display:</p>
<pre>
$<strong> ls -l /proc/self/map_files/</strong>
lr--------. 1 root root 64 Apr 16 21:31
            3252e00000-3252e20000 -&gt; /usr/lib64/ld-2.15.so
...
</pre>
<p>Although these entries are present for memory regions that were mapped with the <strong>MAP_FILE</strong> flag, the way anonymous shared memory (regions created with the <strong>MAP_ANON | MAP_SHARED</strong> flags) is implemented in Linux means that such regions also appear on this directory. Here is an example where the target file is the deleted <em>/dev/zero</em> one:</p>
<pre>
lrw-------. 1 root root 64 Apr 16 21:33
            7fc075d2f000-7fc075e6f000 -&gt; /dev/zero (deleted)

  <dd>
    <p>A file containing the currently mapped memory regions and their access permissions. See <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html"><strong>mmap</strong>(2)</a> for some further information about memory mappings.</p><p>The format of the file is:</p>

    <p>This file displays the current score that the kernel gives to this process for the purpose of selecting a process for the OOM-killer.

<li><p>whether the process creates a lot of children using <a href="../man2/fork.2.html"><strong>fork</strong>(2)</a> (+);</p></li><li><p>whether the process has been running a long time, or has used a lot of CPU time (-);</p></li><li><p>whether the process has a low nice value (i.e., &gt; 0) (+);</p></li><li><p>whether the process is privileged (-); and</p></li><li><p>whether the process is making direct hardware access (-).</p></li>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This file can be used to adjust the badness heuristic used to select which process gets killed in out-of-memory conditions.</p><p>The badness heuristic assigns a value to each candidate task ranging from 0 (never kill) to 1000 (always kill) to determine which process is targeted. The units are roughly a proportion along that range of allowed memory the process may allocate from, based on an estimation of its current memory and swap use. For example, if a task is using all allowed memory, its badness score will be 1000. If it is using half of its allowed memory, its score will be 500.</p><p>There is an additional factor included in the badness score: root processes are given 3% extra memory over other tasks.</p><p>The amount of "allowed" memory depends on the context in which the OOM-killer was called. If it is due to the memory assigned to the allocating task's cpuset being exhausted, the allowed memory represents the set of mems assigned to that cpuset (see <a href="../man7/cpuset.7.html"><strong>cpuset</strong>(7)</a>). If it is due to a mempolicy's node(s) being exhausted, the allowed memory represents the set of mempolicy nodes. If it is due to a memory limit (or swap limit) being reached, the allowed memory is that configured limit. Finally, if it is due to the entire system being out of memory, the allowed memory represents all allocatable resources.</p><p>The value of <em>oom_score_adj</em> is added to the badness score before it is used to determine which task to kill. Acceptable values range from -1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN) to +1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MAX). This allows user space to control the preference for OOM-killing, ranging from always preferring a certain task or completely disabling it from OOM killing. The lowest possible value, -1000, is equivalent to disabling OOM-killing entirely for that task, since it will always report a badness score of 0.</p><p>Consequently, it is very simple for user space to define the amount of memory to consider for each task. Setting a <em>oom_score_adj</em> value of +500, for example, is roughly equivalent to allowing the remainder of tasks sharing the same system, cpuset, mempolicy, or memory controller resources to use at least 50% more memory. A value of -500, on the other hand, would be roughly equivalent to discounting 50% of the task's allowed memory from being considered as scoring against the task.</p><p>For backward compatibility with previous kernels, <em>/proc/[pid]/oom_adj</em> can still be used to tune the badness score. Its value is scaled linearly with <em>oom_score_adj</em>.</p><p>Writing to <em>/proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj</em> or <em>/proc/[pid]/oom_adj</em> will change the other with its scaled value.</p>

    <p>(Explanation for Linux 2.6) For processes running a real-time scheduling policy (<em>policy</em> below; see <a href="../man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html"><strong>sched_setscheduler</strong>(2)</a>), this is the negated scheduling priority, minus one; that is, a number in the range -2 to -100, corresponding to real-time priorities 1 to 99. For processes running under a non-real-time scheduling policy, this is the raw nice value (<a href="../man2/setpriority.2.html"><strong>setpriority</strong>(2)</a>) as represented in the kernel. The kernel stores nice values as numbers in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low), corresponding to the user-visible nice range of -20 to 19.</p><p>Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on the scheduler weighting given to this process.</p>

In other words, processes that are in different user namespaces will potentially see different values when reading from a particular <em>uid_map</em> file, depending on the user ID mappings for the user namespaces of the reading processes.</p><p>Each line in the file specifies a 1-to-1 mapping of a range of contiguous between two user namespaces. The specification in each line takes the form of three numbers delimited by white space. The first two numbers specify the starting user ID in each user namespace. The third number specifies the length of the mapped range. In detail, the fields are interpreted as follows:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    (1)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The start of the range of user IDs in the user namespace of the process <em>pid</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    (2)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The start of the range of user IDs to which the user IDs specified by field one map. How field two is interpreted depends on whether the process that opened <em>uid_map</em> and the process <em>pid</em> are in the same user namespace, as follows:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    a)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the two processes are in different user namespaces: field two is the start of a range of user IDs in the user namespace of the process that opened <em>uid_map</em>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    b)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the two processes are in the same user namespace: field two is the start of the range of user IDs in the parent user namespace of the process <em>pid</em>. (The "parent user namespace" is the user namespace of the process that created a user namespace via a call to <a href="../man2/unshare.2.html"><strong>unshare</strong>(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/clone.2.html"><strong>clone</strong>(2)</a> with the <strong>CLONE_NEWUSER</strong> flag.) This case enables the opener of <em>uid_map</em> (the common case here is opening <em>/proc/self/uid_map</em>) to see the mapping of user IDs into the user namespace of the process that created this user namespace.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    (3)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The length of the range of user IDs that is mapped between the two user namespaces.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<ul>
<li><p>After the creation of a new user namespace, the <em>uid_map</em> file may be written to exactly once to specify the mapping of user IDs in the new user namespace.

<li><p>The three fields must be valid numbers, and the last field must be greater than 0.</p></li><li><p>Lines are terminated by newline characters.</p></li><li><p>There is an (arbitrary) limit on the number of lines in the file. As at Linux 3.8, the limit is five lines.</p></li><li><p>The range of user IDs specified in each line cannot overlap with the ranges in any other lines. In the current implementation (Linux 3.8), this requirement is satisfied by a simplistic implementation that imposes the further requirement that the values in both field 1 and field 2 of successive lines must be in ascending numerical order.</p></li>
</ul></li><li><p>Writes that violate the above rules fail with the error <strong>EINVAL</strong>.</p><p>In order for a process to write to the <em>/proc/[pid]/uid_map</em> (<em>/proc/[pid]/gid_map</em>) file, the following requirements must be met:</p><ul>
<li><p>The process must have the <strong>CAP_SETUID</strong> (<strong>CAP_SETGID</strong>) capability in the user namespace of the process <em>pid</em>.</p></li><li><p>The process must have the <strong>CAP_SETUID</strong> (<strong>CAP_SETGID</strong>) capability in the parent user namespace.</p></li><li><p>The process must be in either the user namespace of the process <em>pid</em> or inside the parent user namespace of the process <em>pid</em>.</p></li>

    <p>This file contains information which is used for diagnosing memory fragmentation issues. Each line starts with the identification of the node and the name of the zone which together identify a memory region This is then followed by the count of available chunks of a certain order in which these zones are split. The size in bytes of a certain order is given by the formual:</p>
<pre>
    (2^order)&nbsp;*&nbsp;PAGE_SIZE
</pre>
<p>The binary buddy allocator algorithm inside the kernel will split one chunk into two chunks of a smaller order (thus with half the size) or combine two contiguous chunks into one larger chunk of a higher order (thus with double the size) to satisfy allocation requests and to counter memory fragmentation. The order matches the column number, when starting to count at zero.</p><p>For example on a x86_64 system:</p>
<pre>
Node 0, zone     DMA     1    1    1    0    2    1    1    0    1    1    3
Node 0, zone   DMA32    65   47    4   81   52   28   13   10    5    1  404
Node 0, zone  Normal   216   55  189  101   84   38   37   27    5    3  587
</pre>
<p>In this example, there is one node containing three zones and there are 11 different chunk sizes. If the page size is 4 kilobyteis, then the first zone called <em>DMA</em> (on x86 the first 16 megabyte of memory) has 1 chunk of 4 kilobytes (order 0) available and has 3 chunks of 4 megabytes (order 10) available.</p><p>If the memory is heavily fragmentated, the counters for higher order chunks will be zero and allocation of large contiguous areas will fail.</p><p>Further information about the zones can be found in <em>/proc/zoneinfo</em>.</p>

If the number of allocated file handles is close to the maximum, you should consider increasing the maximum. Before Linux 2.6, the kernel allocated file handles dynamically, but it didn't free them again. Instead the free file handles were kept in a list for reallocation; the "free file handles" value indicates the size of that list. A large number of free file handles indicates that there was a past peak in the usage of open file handles. Since Linux 2.6, the kernel does deallocate freed file handles, and the "free file handles" value is always zero.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>When the value in this file is 0, no restrictions are placed on the creation of hard links (i.e., this is the historical behavior before Linux 3.6). When the value in this file is 1, a hard link can be created to a target file only if one of the following conditions is true:</p><ul>
<li><p>The caller has the <strong>CAP_FOWNER</strong> capability.</p></li><li><p>The filesystem UID of the process creating the link matches the owner (UID) of the target file (as described in <a href="../man7/credentials.7.html"><strong>credentials</strong>(7)</a>, a process's filesystem UID is normally the same as its effective UID).</p></li><li><p>All of the following conditions are true:</p><ul>
<li><p>the target is a regular file;</p></li><li><p>the target file does not have its set-user-ID permission bit enabled;</p></li><li><p>the target file does not have both its set-group-ID and group-executable permission bits enabled; and</p></li><li><p>the caller has permission to read and write the target file (either via the file's permissions mask or because it has suitable capabilities).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><p>The default value in this file is 0. Setting the value to 1 prevents a longstanding class of security issues caused by hard-link-based time-of-check, time-of-use races, most commonly seen in world-writable directories such as <em>/tmp</em>. The common method of exploiting this flaw is to cross privilege boundaries when following a given hard link (i.e., a root process follows a hard link created by another user). Additionally, on systems without separated partitions, this stops unauthorized users from "pinning" vulnerable set-user-ID and set-group-ID files against being upgraded by the administrator, or linking to special files.</p></li>

    <p>This is a debugging facility to make timer (ab)use in a Linux system visible to kernel and user-space developers. It can be used by kernel and user-space developers to verify that their code does not make undue use of timers. The goal is to avoid unnecessary wakeups, thereby optimizing power consumption.</p><p>If enabled in the kernel (<strong>CONFIG_TIMER_STATS</strong>), but not used, it has almost zero runtime overhead and a relatively small data-structure overhead. Even if collection is enabled at runtime, overhead is low: all the locking is per-CPU and lookup is hashed.</p><p>The <em>/proc/timer_stats</em> file is used both to control sampling facility and to read out the sampled information.</p><p>The timer_stats functionality is inactive on bootup. A sampling period can be started using the following command:</p>
<pre>
    # echo 1 &gt; /proc/timer_stats
</pre>
<p>The following command stops a sampling period:</p>
<pre>
    # echo 0 &gt; /proc/timer_stats
</pre>
<p>The statistics can be retrieved by:</p>
<pre>
    $ cat /proc/timer_stats
</pre>
<p>While sampling is enabled, each readout from <em>/proc/timer_stats</em> will see newly updated statistics. Once sampling is disabled, the sampled information is kept until a new sample period is started. This allows multiple readouts.</p><p>Sample output from <em>/proc/timer_stats</em>:</p>

<p>Many strings (i.e., the environment and command line) are in the internal format, with subfields terminated by null bytes (&apos;&#92;0&apos;), so you may find that things are more readable if you use <em>od -c</em> or <em>tr</em> "&#92;000" "&#92;n" to read them. Alternatively, <em>echo &#96;cat &lt;file&gt;&#96;</em> works well.</p><p>This manual page is incomplete, possibly inaccurate, and is the kind of thing that needs to be updated very often.</p>
