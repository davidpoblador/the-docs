        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Low level or primitive items in a .pst file are identified by an I_ID value. Higher level or composite items in a .pst file are identified by a D_ID value. There are two separate b-trees indexed by these I_ID and D_ID values. Starting with Outlook 2003, the file format changed from one with 32 bit pointers, to one with 64 bit pointers. We describe both formats here.</p>

<p>We only support index types 0x0e, 0x0f, 0x15, and 0x17, and encryption types 0x00, 0x01 and 0x02. Index type 0x0e is the older 32 bit Outlook format. Index type 0x0f seems to be rare, and so far the data seems to be identical to that in type 0x0e files. Index type 0x17 is the newer 64 bit Outlook format. Index type 0x15 seems to be rare, and according to the libpff project should have the same format as type 0x17 files. It was found in a 64-bit pst file created by Visual Recovery. It may be that index types less than 0x10 are 32 bit, and index types greater than or equal to 0x10 are 64 bit, and the low order four bits of the index type is some subtype or minor version number.</p><p>Encryption type 0x00 is no encryption, type 0x01 is "compressible" encryption which is a simple substitution cipher, and type 0x02 is "strong" encryption, which is a simple three rotor Enigma cipher from WWII.</p><p>offsetIndex1 is the file offset of the root of the index1 b-tree, which contains (I_ID, offset, size, unknown) tuples for each item in the file. backPointer1 is the value that should appear in the parent pointer of that root node.</p><p>offsetIndex2 is the file offset of the root of the index2 b-tree, which contains (D_ID, DESC-I_ID, TREE-I_ID, PARENT-D_ID) tuples for each item in the file. backPointer2 is the value that should appear in the parent pointer of that root node.</p>

0004  b5offset        [4 bytes] 0x0020     index reference
</pre>
<p>Note the signature of 0xbcec. There are other descriptor block formats with other signatures. Note the indexOffset of 0x013c - starting at that position in the descriptor block, we have an array of two byte integers. The first integer (0x000b) is a (count-1) of the number of overlapping pairs following the count. The first pair is (0, 0xc), the next pair is (0xc, 0x14) and the last (12th) pair is (0x123, 0x13b). These pairs are (start,end+1) offsets of items in this block. So we have count+2 integers following the count value.</p><p>Note the b5offset of 0x0020, which is a type that I will call an index reference. Such index references have at least two different forms, and may point to data either in this block, or in some other block. External pointer references have the low order 4 bits all set, and are ID2 values that can be used to fetch data. This value of 0x0020 is an internal pointer reference, which needs to be right shifted by 4 bits to become 0x0002, which is then a byte offset to be added to the above indexOffset plus two (to skip the count), so it points to the (0xc, 0x14) pair.</p><p>So far we have only described internal index references where the high order 16 bits are zero. That suffices for single descriptor blocks. But in the case of the type 0x0101 descriptor block, we have an array of subblocks. In this case, the high order 16 bits of an internal index reference are used to select the subblock. Each subblock starts with a 16 bit indexOffset which points to the count and array of 16 bit integer pairs which are offsets in the current subblock.</p><p>Finally, we have the offset and size of the "b5" block located at offset 0xc with a size of 8 bytes in this descriptor block. The "b5" block has the following format:</p>
<pre>
0000  signature       [2 bytes] 0x02b5     constant
0002  datasize        [2 bytes] 0x0006     constant +2 for 8 byte entries
0004  descoffset      [4 bytes] 0x0040     index reference
</pre>
<p>Note the descoffset of 0x0040, which again is an index reference. In this case, it is an internal pointer reference, which needs to be right shifted by 4 bits to become 0x0004, which is then a byte offset to be added to the above indexOffset plus two (to skip the count), so it points to the (0x14, 0x7c) pair. The datasize (6) plus the b5 code (02) gives the size of the entries, in this case 8 bytes. We now have the offset 0x14 of the descriptor array, composed of 8 byte entries that describe MAPI elements. Each descriptor entry has the following format:</p>
<pre>
0000  itemType        [2 bytes]
0002  referenceType   [2 bytes]
0004  value           [4 bytes]
</pre>
<p>For some reference types (2, 3, 0xb) the value is used directly. Otherwise, the value is an index reference, which is either an ID2 value, or an offset, to be right shifted by 4 bits and used to fetch a pair from the index table to find the offset and size of the item in this descriptor block.</p><p>The following reference types are known, but not all of these are implemented in the code yet.</p>

0004  7coffset        [4 bytes] 0x0040     index reference
</pre>
<p>Note the signature of 0x7cec. There are other descriptor block formats with other signatures. Note the indexOffset of 0x017a - starting at that position in the descriptor block, we have an array of two byte integers. The first integer (0x0006) is a (count-1) of the number of overlapping pairs following the count. The first pair is (0, 0xc), the next pair is (0xc, 0x14) and the last (7th) pair is (0x160, 0x179). These pairs are (start,end+1) offsets of items in this block. So we have count+2 integers following the count value.</p><p>Note the 7coffset of 0x0040, which is an index reference. In this case, it is an internal reference pointer, which needs to be right shifted by 4 bits to become 0x0004, which is then a byte offset to be added to the above indexOffset plus two (to skip the count), so it points to the (0x14, 0xea) pair. We have the offset and size of the "7c" block located at offset 0x14 with a size of 214 bytes in this case. The "7c" block starts with a header with the following format:</p>
<pre>
0000  signature       [1 bytes] 0x7c       constant
0001  itemCount       [1 bytes] 0x18       in this case
0002  unknown         [2 bytes] 0x0060     in this case
0004  unknown         [2 bytes] 0x0060     in this case
0006  unknown         [2 bytes] 0x0062     in this case
0008  recordSize      [2 bytes] 0x0065     in this case
000a  b5Offset        [4 bytes] 0x0020     index reference
000e  index2Offset    [4 bytes] 0x0080     index reference
0012  unknown         [2 bytes] 0x0000     in this case
0014  unknown         [2 bytes] 0x0000     in this case
</pre>
<p>Note the b5Offset of 0x0020, which is an index reference. In this case, it is an internal reference pointer, which needs to be right shifted by 4 bits to become 0x0002, which is then a byte offset to be added to the above indexOffset plus two (to skip the count), so it points to the (0xc, 0x14) pair. Finally, we have the offset and size of the "b5" block located at offset 0xc with a size of 8 bytes in this descriptor block. The "b5" block has the following format:</p>
<pre>
0000  signature       [2 bytes] 0x04b5     constant
0002  datasize        [2 bytes] 0x0002     +4 for 6 byte entries in this case
0004  descoffset      [4 bytes] 0x0060     index reference
</pre>
<p>Note the descoffset of 0x0060, which again is an index reference. In this case, it is an internal pointer reference, which needs to be right shifted by 4 bits to become 0x0006, which is then a byte offset to be added to the above indexOffset plus two (to skip the count), so it points to the (0xea, 0xf0) pair. The datasize (2) plus the b5 code (04) gives the size of the entries, in this case 6 bytes. We now have the offset 0xea of an unused block of data in an unknown format, composed of 6 byte entries. That gives us (0xf0 - 0xea)/6 = 1, so we have a recordCount of one.</p><p>We have seen cases where the descoffset in the b5 block is zero, and the index2Offset in the 7c block is zero. This has been seen for objects that seem to be attachments on messages that have been read. Before the message was read, it did not have any attachments.</p><p>Note the index2Offset above of 0x0080, which again is an index reference. In this case, it is an internal pointer reference, which needs to be right shifted by 4 bits to become 0x0008, which is then a byte offset to be added to the above indexOffset plus two (to skip the count), so it points to the (0xf0, 0x155) pair. This is an array of tables of four byte integers. We will call these the IND2 tables. The size of each of these tables is specified by the recordSize field of the "7c" header. The number of these tables is the above recordCount value derived from the "b5" block.</p><p>Now the remaining data in the "7c" block after the header starts at offset 0x2a. There should be itemCount 8 byte items here, with the following format:</p>
<pre>
0000  referenceType   [2 bytes]
0002  itemType        [2 bytes]
0004  ind2Offset      [2 bytes]
0006  size            [1 byte]
0007  unknown         [1 byte]
</pre>
<p>The ind2Offset is a byte offset into the current IND2 table of some value. If that is a four byte integer value, then once we fetch that, we have the same triple (item type, reference type, value) as we find in the 0xbcec style descriptor blocks. If not, then this value is used directly. These 8 byte descriptors are processed recordCount times, each time using the next IND2 table. The item and reference types are as described above for the 0xbcec format descriptor block.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>This descriptor block contains a list of I_ID values. It is used when an I_ID (that would normally point to a type 0x7cec or 0xbcec descriptor block) contains more data than can fit in any single descriptor of those types. In this case, it points to a type 0x0101 block, which contains a list of I_ID values that themselves point to the actual descriptor blocks. The total length value in the 0x0101 header is the sum of the lengths of the blocks pointed to by the list of I_ID values. The result is an array of subblocks, that may contain index references where the high order 16 bits specify which descriptor subblock to use. Only the first descriptor subblock contains the signature (0xbcec or 0x7cec).</p>
