      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p><strong>slurm.conf</strong> is an ASCII file which describes general SLURM configuration information, the nodes to be managed, information about how those nodes are grouped into partitions, and various scheduling parameters associated with those partitions. This file should be consistent across all nodes in the cluster.</p><p>The file location can be modified at system build time using the DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter or at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF environment variable. The SLURM daemons also allow you to override both the built-in and environment-provided location using the "-f" option on the command line.</p><p>The contents of the file are case insensitive except for the names of nodes and partitions. Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated as a comment through the end of that line. Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of SLURM daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution of the command "scontrol reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.</p><p>If a line begins with the word "Include" followed by whitespace and then a file name, that file will be included inline with the current configuration file. For large or complex systems, multiple configuration files may prove easier to manage and enable reuse of some files.</p><p>Note on file permissions:</p><p>The <em>slurm.conf</em> file must be readable by all users of SLURM, since it is used by many of the SLURM commands.  Other files that are defined in the <em>slurm.conf</em> file, such as log files and job accounting files, may need to be created/owned by the user "SlurmUser" to be successfully accessed.  Use the "chown" and "chmod" commands to set the ownership and permissions appropriately. See the section <strong>FILE AND DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS</strong> for information about the various files and directories used by SLURM.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">PARAMETERS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The overall configuration parameters available include:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AccountingStorageBackupHost</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The name of the backup machine hosting the accounting storage database. If used with the accounting_storage/slurmdbd plugin, this is where the backup slurmdbd would be running. Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AccountingStorageEnforce</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This controls what level of association-based enforcement to impose on job submissions.  Valid options are any combination of <em>associations</em>, <em>limits</em>, <em>nojobs</em>, <em>nosteps</em>, <em>qos</em>, <em>safe</em>, and <em>wckeys</em>, or <em>all</em> for all things (expect nojobs and nosteps, they must be requested as well).</p><p>If limits, qos, or wckeys are set, associations will automatically be set.</p><p>If wckeys is set, TrackWCKey will automatically be set.</p><p>If safe is set, limits and associations will automatically be set.</p><p>If nojobs is set nosteps will automatically be set.</p><p>By enforcing Associations no new job is allowed to run unless a corresponding association exists in the system.  If limits are enforced users can be limited by association to whatever job size or run time limits are defined.</p><p>If nojobs is set Slurm will not account for any jobs or steps on the system, like wise if nosteps is set Slurm will not account for any steps ran limits will still be enforced.</p><p>If safe is enforced a job will only be launched against an association or qos that has a GrpCPUMins limit set if the job will be able to run to completion. Without this option set, jobs will be launched as long as their usage hasn't reached the cpu-minutes limit which can lead to jobs being launched but then killed when the limit is reached.</p><p>With qos and/or wckeys enforced jobs will not be scheduled unless a valid qos and/or workload characterization key is specified.</p><p>When <strong>AccountingStorageEnforce</strong> is changed, a restart of the slurmctld daemon is required (not just a "scontrol reconfig").</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AccountingStorageHost</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The name of the machine hosting the accounting storage database. Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise. Also see <strong>DefaultStorageHost</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AccountingStorageLoc</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The fully qualified file name where accounting records are written when the <strong>AccountingStorageType</strong> is "accounting_storage/filetxt" or else the name of the database where accounting records are stored when the <strong>AccountingStorageType</strong> is a database. Also see <strong>DefaultStorageLoc</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AccountingStoragePass</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The password used to gain access to the database to store the accounting data.  Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.  In the case of SLURM DBD (Database Daemon) with MUNGE authentication this can be configured to use a MUNGE daemon specifically configured to provide authentication between clusters while the default MUNGE daemon provides authentication within a cluster.  In that case, <strong>AccountingStoragePass</strong> should specify the named port to be used for communications with the alternate MUNGE daemon (e.g.  "/var/run/munge/global.socket.2"). The default value is NULL.  Also see <strong>DefaultStoragePass</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AccountingStoragePort</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The listening port of the accounting storage database server. Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise. Also see <strong>DefaultStoragePort</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AccountingStorageType</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The accounting storage mechanism type.  Acceptable values at present include "accounting_storage/filetxt", "accounting_storage/mysql", "accounting_storage/none" and "accounting_storage/slurmdbd".  The "accounting_storage/filetxt" value indicates that accounting records will be written to the file specified by the <strong>AccountingStorageLoc</strong> parameter.  The "accounting_storage/mysql" value indicates that accounting records will be written to a MySQL or MariaDB database specified by the <strong>AccountingStorageLoc</strong> parameter. The "accounting_storage/slurmdbd" value indicates that accounting records will be written to the SLURM DBD, which manages an underlying MySQL database. See "man slurmdbd" for more information.  The default value is "accounting_storage/none" and indicates that account records are not maintained. Note: The filetxt plugin records only a limited subset of accounting information and will prevent some sacct options from proper operation. Also see <strong>DefaultStorageType</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AccountingStorageUser</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The user account for accessing the accounting storage database. Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise. Also see <strong>DefaultStorageUser</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AccountingStoreJobComment</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to "YES" then include the job's comment field in the job complete message sent to the Accounting Storage database.  The default is "YES".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AcctGatherNodeFreq</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The AcctGather plugins sampling interval for node accounting. For AcctGather plugin values of none, this parameter is ignored. For all other values this parameter is the number of seconds between node accounting samples. For the acct_gather_energy/rapl plugin, set a value less than 300 because the counters may overflow beyond this rate. The default value is zero. This value disables accounting sampling for nodes. Note: The accounting sampling interval for jobs is determined by the value of <strong>JobAcctGatherFrequency</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AcctGatherEnergyType</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Identifies the plugin to be used for energy consumption accounting. The jobacct_gather plugin and slurmd daemon call this plugin to collect energy consumption data for jobs and nodes. The collection of energy consumption data takes place on node level, hence only in case of exclusive job allocation the energy consumption measurements will reflect the jobs real consumption. In case of node sharing between jobs the reported consumed energy per job (through sstat or sacct) will not reflect the real energy consumed by the jobs.</p><p>Configurable values at present are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>acct_gather_energy/none</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>No energy consumption data is collected.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>acct_gather_energy/ipmi</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Energy consumption data is collected from the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) using the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>acct_gather_energy/rapl</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Energy consumption data is collected from hardware sensors using the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) mechanism. Note that enabling RAPL may require the execution of the command "sudo modprobe msr".</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AcctGatherInfinibandType</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Identifies the plugin to be used for infiniband network traffic accounting. The plugin is activated only when profiling on hdf5 files is activated and the user asks for network data collection for jobs through --profile=Network (or =All). The collection of network traffic data takes place on node level, hence only in case of exclusive job allocation the collected values will reflect the jobs real traffic. All network traffic data are logged on hdf5 files per job on each node. No storage on the Slurm database takes place.</p><p>Configurable values at present are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>acct_gather_infiniband/none</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>No infiniband network data are collected.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>acct_gather_infiniband/ofed</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Infiniband network traffic data are collected from the hardware monitoring counters of Infiniband devices through the OFED library.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AcctGatherFilesystemType</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Identifies the plugin to be used for filesystem traffic accounting. The plugin is activated only when profiling on hdf5 files is activated and the user asks for filesystem data collection for jobs through --profile=Lustre (or =All). The collection of filesystem traffic data takes place on node level, hence only in case of exclusive job allocation the collected values will reflect the jobs real traffic. All filesystem traffic data are logged on hdf5 files per job on each node. No storage on the Slurm database takes place.</p><p>Configurable values at present are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>acct_gather_filesystem/none</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>No filesystem data are collected.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>acct_gather_filesystem/lustre</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Lustre filesystem traffic data are collected from the counters found in /proc/fs/lustre/.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AcctGatherProfileType</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Identifies the plugin to be used for detailed job profiling. The jobacct_gather plugin and slurmd daemon call this plugin to collect detailed data such as I/O counts, memory usage, or energy consumption for jobs and nodes. There are interfaces in this plugin to collect data as step start and completion, task start and completion, and at the account gather frequency. The data collected at the node level is related to jobs only in case of exclusive job allocation.</p><p>Configurable values at present are:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>acct_gather_profile/none</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>No profile data is collected.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>acct_gather_profile/hdf5</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This enables the HDF5 plugin. The directory where the profile files are stored and which values are collected are configured in the acct_gather.conf file.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AuthInfo</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Additional information to be used for authentication of communications between the Slurm daemons (slurmctld and slurmd) and the Slurm clients.  The interpretation of this option is specific to the configured <strong>AuthType</strong>.  In the case of <em>auth/munge</em>, the value of this parameter can specify the socket of a MUNGE daemon other than the default MUNGE daemon.  If not set, the default authentication information will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AuthType</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The authentication method for communications between SLURM components. Acceptable values at present include "auth/none", "auth/authd", and "auth/munge". The default value is "auth/munge". "auth/none" includes the UID in each communication, but it is not verified. This may be fine for testing purposes, but <strong>do not use "auth/none" if you desire any security</strong>. "auth/authd" indicates that Brett Chun's authd is to be used (see "http://www.theether.org/authd/" for more information. Note that authd is no longer actively supported). "auth/munge" indicates that LLNL's MUNGE is to be used (this is the best supported authentication mechanism for SLURM, see "http://munge.googlecode.com/" for more information). All SLURM daemons and commands must be terminated prior to changing the value of <strong>AuthType</strong> and later restarted (SLURM jobs can be preserved).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>BackupAddr</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The name that <strong>BackupController</strong> should be referred to in establishing a communications path. This name will be used as an argument to the gethostbyname() function for identification. For example, "elx0000" might be used to designate the Ethernet address for node "lx0000". By default the <strong>BackupAddr</strong> will be identical in value to <strong>BackupController</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>BackupController</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The name of the machine where SLURM control functions are to be executed in the event that <strong>ControlMachine</strong> fails. This node may also be used as a compute server if so desired. It will come into service as a controller only upon the failure of ControlMachine and will revert to a "standby" mode when the ControlMachine becomes available once again. This should be a node name without the full domain name.   I.e., the hostname returned by the <em>gethostname()</em> function cut at the first dot (e.g. use "tux001" rather than "tux001.my.com"). The backup controller recovers state information from the <strong>StateSaveLocation</strong> directory, which must be readable and writable from both the primary and backup controllers. While not essential, it is recommended that you specify a backup controller. See  the <strong>RELOCATING CONTROLLERS</strong> section if you change this.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>BatchStartTimeout</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum time (in seconds) that a batch job is permitted for launching before being considered missing and releasing the allocation. The default value is 10 (seconds). Larger values may be required if more time is required to execute the <strong>Prolog</strong>, load user environment variables (for Moab spawned jobs), or if the slurmd daemon gets paged from memory.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The test for a job being successfully launched is only performed when the Slurm daemon on the compute node registers state with the slurmctld daemon on the head node, which happens fairly rarely. Therefore a job will not necessarily be terminated if its start time exceeds <strong>BatchStartTimeout</strong>. This configuration parameter is also applied to launch tasks and avoid aborting <strong>srun</strong> commands due to long running <strong>Prolog</strong> scripts.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>CacheGroups</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to 1, the slurmd daemon will cache /etc/groups entries. This can improve performance for highly parallel jobs if NIS servers are used and unable to respond very quickly. The default value is 0 to disable caching group data.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>CheckpointType</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The system-initiated checkpoint method to be used for user jobs. The slurmctld daemon must be restarted for a change in <strong>CheckpointType</strong> to take effect. Supported values presently include:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>checkpoint/aix</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>for IBM AIX systems only</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>checkpoint/blcr</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Berkeley Lab Checkpoint Restart (BLCR). NOTE: If a file is found at sbin/scch (relative to the SLURM installation location), it will be executed upon completion of the checkpoint. This can be a script used for managing the checkpoint files. NOTE: SLURM's BLCR logic only supports batch jobs.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>checkpoint/none</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>no checkpoint support (default)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>checkpoint/ompi</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>OpenMPI (version 1.3 or higher)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>checkpoint/poe</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>for use with IBM POE (Parallel Operating Environment) only</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ClusterName</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The name by which this SLURM managed cluster is known in the accounting database.  This is needed distinguish accounting records when multiple clusters report to the same database. Because of limitations in some databases, any upper case letters in the name will be silently mapped to lower case. In order to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the name be lower case.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>CompleteWait</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The time, in seconds, given for a job to remain in COMPLETING state before any additional jobs are scheduled. If set to zero, pending jobs will be started as soon as possible. Since a COMPLETING job's resources are released for use by other jobs as soon as the <strong>Epilog</strong> completes on each individual node, this can result in very fragmented resource allocations. To provide jobs with the minimum response time, a value of zero is recommended (no waiting). To minimize fragmentation of resources, a value equal to <strong>KillWait</strong> plus two is recommended. In that case, setting <strong>KillWait</strong> to a small value may be beneficial. The default value of <strong>CompleteWait</strong> is zero seconds. The value may not exceed 65533.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ControlAddr</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Name that <strong>ControlMachine</strong> should be referred to in establishing a communications path. This name will be used as an argument to the gethostbyname() function for identification. For example, "elx0000" might be used to designate the Ethernet address for node "lx0000". By default the <strong>ControlAddr</strong> will be identical in value to <strong>ControlMachine</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ControlMachine</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The short hostname of the machine where SLURM control functions are executed (i.e. the name returned by the command "hostname -s", use "tux001" rather than "tux001.my.com"). This value must be specified. In order to support some high availability architectures, multiple hostnames may be listed with comma separators and one <strong>ControlAddr</strong> must be specified. The high availability system must insure that the slurmctld daemon is running on only one of these hosts at a time. See the <strong>RELOCATING CONTROLLERS</strong> section if you change this.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>CoreSpecPlugin</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Identifies the plugins to be used for enforcement of core specialization. The slurmd daemon must be restarted for a change in CoreSpecPlugin to take effect. Acceptable values at present include:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>core_spec/cray</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>used only for Cray systems</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>core_spec/none</strong></p>
  </dt>

    <p><strong>GroupUpdateForce</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to a non-zero value, then information about which users are members of groups allowed to use a partition will be updated periodically, even when there have been no changes to the /etc/group file.

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>GroupUpdateTime</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Controls how frequently information about which users are members of groups allowed to use a partition will be updated.

    <p><strong>HealthCheckProgram</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Fully qualified pathname of a script to execute as user root periodically on all compute nodes that are <strong>not</strong> in the NOT_RESPONDING state. This program may be used to verify the node is fully operational and DRAIN the node or send email if a problem is detected. Any action to be taken must be explicitly performed by the program (e.g. execute "scontrol update NodeName=foo State=drain Reason=tmp_file_system_full" to drain a node). The execution interval is controlled using the <strong>HealthCheckInterval</strong> parameter. Note that the <strong>HealthCheckProgram</strong> will be executed at the same time on all nodes to minimize its impact upon parallel programs. This program is will be killed if it does not terminate normally within 60 seconds. By default, no program will be executed.</p>
  </dd>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The interval, in seconds, after which a non-responsive job allocation command (e.g. <strong>srun</strong> or <strong>salloc</strong>) will result in the job being terminated. If the node on which the command is executed fails or the command abnormally terminates, this will terminate its job allocation. This option has no effect upon batch jobs. When setting a value, take into consideration that a debugger using <strong>srun</strong> to launch an application may leave the <strong>srun</strong> command in a stopped state for extended periods of time. This limit is ignored for jobs running in partitions with the <strong>RootOnly</strong> flag set (the scheduler running as root will be responsible for the job). The default value is unlimited (zero) and may not exceed 65533 seconds.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>JobAcctGatherType</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The job accounting mechanism type. Acceptable values at present include "jobacct_gather/aix" (for AIX operating system), "jobacct_gather/linux" (for Linux operating system), "jobacct_gather/cgroup" and "jobacct_gather/none" (no accounting data collected). The default value is "jobacct_gather/none". "jobacct_gather/cgroup" is an experimental plugin for the Linux operating system that uses cgroups to collect accounting statistics. The plugin collects the following statistics: From the cgroup memory subsystem: memory.usage_in_bytes (reported as 'pages') and rss from memory.stat (reported as 'rss'). From the cgroup cpuacct subsystem: user cpu time and system cpu time. No value is provided by cgroups for virtual memory size ('vsize'). In order to use the <strong>sstat</strong> tool, "jobacct_gather/aix", "jobacct_gather/linux", or "jobacct_gather/cgroup" must be configured.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Changing this configuration parameter changes the contents of the messages between Slurm daemons. Any previously running job steps are managed by a slurmstepd daemon that will persist through the lifetime of that job step and not change it's communication prototol. Only change this configuration parameter when there are no running job steps.</p>

    <p>This option controls what to do by default after a node failure. If <strong>JobRequeue</strong> is set to a value of 1, then any batch job running on the failed node will be requeued for execution on different nodes. If <strong>JobRequeue</strong> is set to a value of 0, then any job running on the failed node will be terminated. Use the <strong>sbatch</strong> <em>--no-requeue</em> or <em>--requeue</em> option to change the default behavior for individual jobs. The default value is 1.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>JobSubmitPlugins</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A comma delimited list of job submission plugins to be used. The specified plugins will be executed in the order listed. These are intended to be site-specific plugins which can be used to set default job parameters and/or logging events. Sample plugins available in the distribution include "all_partitions", "cnode", "defaults", "logging", "lua", and "partition". For examples of use, see the SLURM code in "src/plugins/job_submit" and "contribs/lua/job_submit*.lua" then modify the code to satisfy your needs. SLURM can be configured to use multiple job_submit plugins if desired, however the lua plugin will only execute one lua script named "job_submit.lua" and located in default script directory (typically the subdirectory "etc" of the installation directory). No job submission plugins are used by default.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>Licenses</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specification of licenses (or other resources available on all nodes of the cluster) which can be allocated to jobs. License names can optionally be followed by a colon and count with a default count of one. Multiple license names should be comma separated (e.g. "Licenses=foo:4,bar"). Note that SLURM prevents jobs from being scheduled if their required license specification is not available. SLURM does not prevent jobs from using licenses that are not explicitly listed in the job submission specification.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>LogTimeFormat</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Format of the timestamp in slurmctld and slurmd log files. Accepted values are "iso8601", "iso8601_ms", "rfc5424", "rfc5424_ms", "clock", "short" and "thread_id". The values ending in "_ms" differ from the ones without in that fractional seconds with millisecond precision are printed. The default value is "iso8601_ms". The "rfc5424" formats are the same as the "iso8601" formats except that the timezone value is also shown. The "clock" format shows a timestamp in microseconds retrieved with the C standard clock() function. The "short" format is a short date and time format. The "thread_id" format shows the timestamp in the C standard ctime() function form without the year but including the microseconds, the daemon's process ID and the current thread ID.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MailProg</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Fully qualified pathname to the program used to send email per user request. The default value is "/usr/bin/mail".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MaxArraySize</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum job array size. The maximum job array task index value will be one less than MaxArraySize to allow for an index value of zero. Configure MaxArraySize to 0 in order to disable job array use. The value may not exceed 65533. Default value is 1001.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MaxJobCount</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum number of jobs SLURM can have in its active database at one time. Set the values of <strong>MaxJobCount</strong> and <strong>MinJobAge</strong> to insure the slurmctld daemon does not exhaust its memory or other resources. Once this limit is reached, requests to submit additional jobs will fail. The default value is 10000 jobs. Performance can suffer with more than a couple hundred thousand jobs. Setting per MaxSubmitJobs per user is generally valuable to prevent a single user from filling the system with jobs. This is accomplished using Slurm's database and configuring enforcement of resource limits. This value may not be reset via "scontrol reconfig". It only takes effect upon restart of the slurmctld daemon.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MaxJobId</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum job id to be used for jobs submitted to SLURM without a specific requested value. Job id values generated will incremented by 1 for each subsequent job. This may be used to provide a meta-scheduler with a job id space which is disjoint from the interactive jobs. Once <strong>MaxJobId</strong> is reached, the next job will be assigned <strong>FirstJobId</strong>. The default value is 4294901760 (0xffff0000). Also see <strong>FirstJobId</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MaxMemPerCPU</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Maximum real memory size available per allocated CPU in MegaBytes. Used to avoid over-subscribing memory and causing paging. <strong>MaxMemPerCPU</strong> would generally be used if individual processors are allocated to jobs (<strong>SelectType=select/cons_res</strong>). The default value is 0 (unlimited). Also see <strong>DefMemPerCPU</strong> and <strong>MaxMemPerNode</strong>. <strong>MaxMemPerCPU</strong> and <strong>MaxMemPerNode</strong> are mutually exclusive. NOTE: Enforcement of memory limits currently requires enabling of accounting, which samples memory use on a periodic basis (data need not be stored, just collected).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MaxMemPerNode</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Maximum real memory size available per allocated node in MegaBytes. Used to avoid over-subscribing memory and causing paging. <strong>MaxMemPerNode</strong> would generally be used if whole nodes are allocated to jobs (<strong>SelectType=select/linear</strong>) and resources are shared (<strong>Shared=yes</strong> or <strong>Shared=force</strong>). The default value is 0 (unlimited). Also see <strong>DefMemPerNode</strong> and <strong>MaxMemPerCPU</strong>. <strong>MaxMemPerCPU</strong> and <strong>MaxMemPerNode</strong> are mutually exclusive. NOTE: Enforcement of memory limits currently requires enabling of accounting, which samples memory use on a periodic basis (data need not be stored, just collected).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MaxStepCount</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum number of steps that any job can initiate. This parameter is intended to limit the effect of bad batch scripts. The default value is 40000 steps.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MaxTasksPerNode</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Maximum number of tasks SLURM will allow a job step to spawn on a single node. The default <strong>MaxTasksPerNode</strong> is 128. May not exceed 65533.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MessageTimeout</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Time permitted for a round-trip communication to complete in seconds. Default value is 10 seconds. For systems with shared nodes, the slurmd daemon could be paged out and necessitate higher values.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MinJobAge</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The minimum age of a completed job before its record is purged from SLURM's active database. Set the values of <strong>MaxJobCount</strong> and</p>
<pre>
  to insure the slurmctld daemon does not exhaust
</pre>
<p>its memory or other resources. The default value is 300 seconds. A value of zero prevents any job record purging. In order to eliminate some possible race conditions, the minimum non-zero value for <strong>MinJobAge</strong> recommended is 2. May not exceed 65533.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MpiDefault</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Identifies the default type of MPI to be used. Srun may override this configuration parameter in any case. Currently supported versions include: <strong>lam</strong>, <strong>mpich1_p4</strong>, <strong>mpich1_shmem</strong>, <strong>mpichgm</strong>, <strong>mpichmx</strong>, <strong>mvapich</strong>, <strong>none</strong> (default, which works for many other versions of MPI) and <strong>openmpi</strong>. <strong>pmi2</strong>, More information about MPI use is available here &lt;http://slurm.schedmd.com/mpi_guide.html&gt;.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>MpiParams</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>MPI parameters. Used to identify ports used by OpenMPI only and the input format is "ports=12000-12999" to identify a range of communication ports to be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>OverTimeLimit</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Number of minutes by which a job can exceed its time limit before being canceled. The configured job time limit is treated as a <em>soft</em> limit. Adding <strong>OverTimeLimit</strong> to the <em>soft</em> limit provides a <em>hard</em> limit, at which point the job is canceled. This is particularly useful for backfill scheduling, which bases upon each job's soft time limit. The default value is zero. May not exceed exceed 65533 minutes. A value of "UNLIMITED" is also supported.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>PluginDir</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>

    <p><strong>PlugStackConfig</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Location of the config file for SLURM stackable plugins that use the Stackable Plugin Architecture for Node job (K)control (SPANK). This provides support for a highly configurable set of plugins to be called before and/or after execution of each task spawned as part of a user's job step.  Default location is "plugstack.conf" in the same directory as the system slurm.conf. For more information on SPANK plugins, see the <a href="../man8/spank.8.html"><strong>spank</strong>(8)</a> manual.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>PreemptMode</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enables gang scheduling and/or controls the mechanism used to preempt jobs.  When the <strong>PreemptType</strong> parameter is set to enable preemption, the <strong>PreemptMode</strong> selects the default mechanism used to preempt the lower priority jobs for the cluster. <strong>PreemptMode</strong> may be specified on a per partition basis to over ride this default value if <strong>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</strong>, but a valid default <strong>PreemptMode</strong> value must be specified for the cluster as a whole when preemption is enabled. The <strong>GANG</strong> option is used to enable gang scheduling independent of whether preemption is enabled (the <strong>PreemptType</strong> setting).  The <strong>GANG</strong> option can be specified in addition to a <strong>PreemptMode</strong> setting with the two options comma separated.  The <strong>SUSPEND</strong> option requires that gang scheduling be enabled (i.e, "PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG").</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>OFF</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>is the default value and disables job preemption and gang scheduling.

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>GANG</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>enables gang scheduling (time slicing) of jobs in the same partition. NOTE: Gang scheduling is performed independently for each partition, so configuring partitions with overlapping nodes and gang scheduling is generally not recommended.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>REQUEUE</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>preempts jobs by requeuing them (if possible) or canceling them.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>SUSPEND</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>preempts jobs by suspending them. A suspended job will resume execution once the high priority job preempting it completes. The <strong>SUSPEND</strong> may only be used with the <strong>GANG</strong> option (the gang scheduler module performs the job resume operation) and with <strong>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</strong> (the logic to suspend and resume jobs current only has the data structures to support partitions).</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>PriorityDecayHalfLife</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This controls how long prior resource use is considered in determining how over- or under-serviced an association is (user, bank account and cluster) in determining job priority. The record of usage will be decayed over time, with half of the original value cleared at age <strong>PriorityDecayHalfLife</strong>. If set to 0 no decay will be applied. This is helpful if you want to enforce hard time limits per association.  If set to 0 <strong>PriorityUsageResetPeriod</strong> must be set to some interval. Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor. The unit is a time string (i.e. min, hr:min:00, days-hr:min:00, or days-hr).  The default value is 7-0 (7 days).</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies the job age which will be given the maximum age factor in computing priority. For example, a value of 30 minutes would result in all jobs over 30 minutes old would get the same age-based priority. Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor. The unit is a time string (i.e. min, hr:min:00, days-hr:min:00, or days-hr).  The default value is 7-0 (7 days).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>PriorityUsageResetPeriod</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>At this interval the usage of associations will be reset to 0.  This is used if you want to enforce hard limits of time usage per association.  If PriorityDecayHalfLife is set to be 0 no decay will happen and this is the only way to reset the usage accumulated by running jobs.  By default this is turned off and it is advised to use the PriorityDecayHalfLife option to avoid not having anything running on your cluster, but if your schema is set up to only allow certain amounts of time on your system this is the way to do it.

The slurmd daemon must be restarted for a change in ProctrackType to take effect. NOTE: "proctrack/linuxproc" and "proctrack/pgid" can fail to identify all processes associated with a job since processes can become a child of the init process (when the parent process terminates) or change their process group. To reliably track all processes, one of the other mechanisms utilizing kernel modifications is preferable. NOTE: "proctrack/linuxproc" is not compatible with "switch/elan." NOTE: The <strong>JobContainerType</strong> applies to a job allocation, while <strong>ProctrackType</strong> applies to job steps. Acceptable values at present include:</p>

    <p><strong>Prolog</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Fully qualified pathname of a program for the slurmd to execute whenever it is asked to run a job step from a new job allocation (e.g. "/usr/local/slurm/prolog").  A glob pattern (See <a href="../man7/glob.7.html"><strong>glob</strong>(7)</a>) may also be used to specify more than one program to run (e.g. "/etc/slurm/prolog.d/*"). The slurmd executes the prolog before starting the first job step.  The prolog script or scripts may be used to purge files, enable user login, etc.  By default there is no prolog. Any configured script is expected to complete execution quickly (in less time than <strong>MessageTimeout</strong>). If the prolog fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will result in the node being set to a DRAIN state and the job requeued to executed on another node. See <strong>Prolog and Epilog Scripts</strong> for more information.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>PrologFlags</strong></p>

<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Alloc</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set, the Prolog script will be executed at job allocation. By default, Prolog is executed just before the task is launched. Therefore, when salloc is started, no Prolog is executed. <strong>Alloc</strong> is useful for preparing things before a user starts to use any allocated resources. In particular, this flag is needed on a Cray system when cluster compatibility mode is enabled.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>NoHold</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set, Alloc is also set.  This will allow for salloc to not block until the prolog is finished on each node.  The blocking will happen when steps reach the slurmd and before any execution has happened in the step. This is a much faster way to work and if using srun to launch your tasks you should use this flag.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>PrologSlurmctld</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Fully qualified pathname of a program for the slurmctld daemon to execute before granting a new job allocation (e.g. "/usr/local/slurm/prolog_controller"). The program executes as SlurmUser on the same node where the slurmctld daemon executes, giving it permission to drain nodes and requeue the job if a failure occurs or cancel the job if appropriate. The program can be used to reboot nodes or perform other work to prepare resources for use. Exactly what the program does and how it accomplishes this is completely at the discretion of the system administrator. Information about the job being initiated, it's allocated nodes, etc. are passed to the program using environment variables. While this program is running, the nodes associated with the job will be have a POWER_UP/CONFIGURING flag set in their state, which can be readily viewed. The slurmctld daemon will wait indefinitely for this program to complete. Once the program completes with an exit code of zero, the nodes will be considered ready for use and the program will be started. If some node can not be made available for use, the program should drain the node (typically using the scontrol command) and terminate with a non-zero exit code. A non-zero exit code will result in the job being requeued (where possible) or killed. Note that only batch jobs can be requeued.

    <p><strong>PropagateResourceLimits</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A list of comma separated resource limit names. The slurmd daemon uses these names to obtain the associated (soft) limit values from the users process environment on the submit node. These limits are then propagated and applied to the jobs that will run on the compute nodes. This parameter can be useful when system limits vary among nodes. Any resource limits that do not appear in the list are not propagated. However, the user can override this by specifying which resource limits to propagate with the srun commands "--propagate" option. If neither of the 'propagate resource limit' parameters are specified, then the default action is to propagate all limits.

  <dt>
    <p><strong>ResumeProgram</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>SLURM supports a mechanism to reduce power consumption on nodes that remain idle for an extended period of time. This is typically accomplished by reducing voltage and frequency or powering the node down. <strong>ResumeProgram</strong> is the program that will be executed when a node in power save mode is assigned work to perform. For reasons of reliability, <strong>ResumeProgram</strong> may execute more than once for a node when the <strong>slurmctld</strong> daemon crashes and is restarted. If <strong>ResumeProgram</strong> is unable to restore a node to service, it should requeue any node associated with the node and set the node state to DRAIN. The program executes as <strong>SlurmUser</strong>. The argument to the program will be the names of nodes to be removed from power savings mode (using SLURM's hostlist expression format). By default no program is run. Related configuration options include <strong>ResumeTimeout</strong>, <strong>ResumeRate</strong>, <strong>SuspendRate</strong>, <strong>SuspendTime</strong>, <strong>SuspendTimeout</strong>, <strong>SuspendProgram</strong>, <strong>SuspendExcNodes</strong>, and <strong>SuspendExcParts</strong>. More information is available at the SLURM web site ( http://slurm.schedmd.com/power_save.html ).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ResumeRate</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The rate at which nodes in power save mode are returned to normal operation by <strong>ResumeProgram</strong>. The value is number of nodes per minute and it can be used to prevent power surges if a large number of nodes in power save mode are assigned work at the same time (e.g. a large job starts). A value of zero results in no limits being imposed. The default value is 300 nodes per minute. Related configuration options include <strong>ResumeTimeout</strong>, <strong>ResumeProgram</strong>, <strong>SuspendRate</strong>, <strong>SuspendTime</strong>, <strong>SuspendTimeout</strong>, <strong>SuspendProgram</strong>, <strong>SuspendExcNodes</strong>, and <strong>SuspendExcParts</strong>.</p>

    <p>Normally, <a href="../man1/salloc.1.html"><strong>salloc</strong>(1)</a> will run the user's default shell when a command to execute is not specified on the <strong>salloc</strong> command line. If <strong>SallocDefaultCommand</strong> is specified, <strong>salloc</strong> will instead run the configured command. The command is passed to '/bin/sh -c', so shell metacharacters are allowed, and commands with multiple arguments should be quoted. For instance:</p>
<pre>
    SallocDefaultCommand = "$SHELL"

<p>would run the shell in the user's $SHELL environment variable. and</p>
<pre>
    SallocDefaultCommand = "srun -n1 -N1 --mem-per-cpu=0 --pty --preserve-env --mpi=none $SHELL"
</pre>
<p>would run spawn the user's default shell on the allocated resources, but not consume any of the CPU or memory resources, configure it as a pseudo-terminal, and preserve all of the job's environment variables (i.e. and not over-write them with the job step's allocation information).</p>

    <p><strong>SchedulerParameters</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The interpretation of this parameter varies by <strong>SchedulerType</strong>. Multiple options may be comma separated.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>batch_sched_delay=#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>How long, in seconds, the scheduling of batch jobs can be delayed. This can be useful in a high-throughput environment in which batch jobs are submitted at a very high rate (i.e. using the sbatch command) and one wishes to reduce the overhead of attempting to schedule each job at submit time. The default value is 3 seconds.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bf_continue</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The backfill scheduler periodically releases locks in order to permit other operations to proceed rather than blocking all activity for what could be an extended period of time. Setting this option will cause the backfill scheduler to continue processing pending jobs from its original job list after releasing locks even if job or node state changes. This can result in lower priority jobs from being backfill scheduled instead of newly arrived higher priority jobs, but will permit more queued jobs to be considered for backfill scheduling.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bf_interval=#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The number of seconds between iterations. Higher values result in less overhead and better responsiveness. The default value is 30 seconds. This option applies only to <strong>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bf_max_job_part=#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum number of jobs per partition to attempt backfill scheduling for, not counting jobs which cannot be started due to an association resource limit. This can be especially helpful for systems with large numbers of partitions and jobs. The default value is 0, which means no limit. This option applies only to <strong>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</strong>. Also see the <strong>partition_job_depth</strong> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bf_max_job_start=#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum number of jobs which can be initiated in a single iteration of the backfill scheduler. The default value is 0, which means no limit. This option applies only to <strong>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bf_max_job_test=#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum number of jobs to attempt backfill scheduling for (i.e. the queue depth). Higher values result in more overhead and less responsiveness. Until an attempt is made to backfill schedule a job, its expected initiation time value will not be set. The default value is 100. In the case of large clusters, configuring a relatively small value may be desirable. This option applies only to <strong>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bf_max_job_user=#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum number of jobs per user to attempt backfill scheduling for, not counting jobs which cannot be started due to an association resource limit.  One can set this limit to prevent users from flooding the backfill queue with jobs that cannot start and that prevent jobs from other users to start.  This is similar to the MAXIJOB limit in Maui. The default value is 0, which means no limit. This option applies only to <strong>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bf_resolution=#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The number of seconds in the resolution of data maintained about when jobs begin and end. Higher values result in less overhead and better responsiveness. The default value is 60 seconds. This option applies only to <strong>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bf_window=#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The number of minutes into the future to look when considering jobs to schedule. Higher values result in more overhead and less responsiveness. The default value is 1440 minutes (one day). A value at least as long as the highest allowed time limit is generally advisable to prevent job starvation. In order limit the amount of data managed by the backfill scheduler, if the value of <strong>bf_window</strong> is increased, then it is generally advisable to also increase <strong>bf_resolution</strong>. This option applies only to <strong>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>default_queue_depth=#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The default number of jobs to attempt scheduling (i.e. the queue depth) when a running job completes or other routine actions occur. The full queue will be tested on a less frequent basis as defined by the <strong>sched_interval</strong> option described below. The default value is 100. See the <strong>partition_job_depth</strong> option to limit depth by partition. In the case of large clusters (more than 1000 nodes), configuring a relatively small value may be desirable. Specifying a large value (say 1000 or higher) can be expected to result in poor system responsiveness since this scheduling logic will not release locks for other events to occur. It would be better to let the backfill scheduler process a larger number of jobs (see <strong>bf_max_job_test</strong>, <strong>bf_continue</strong>  and other options here for more information).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>defer</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Setting this option will avoid attempting to schedule each job individually at job submit time, but defer it until a later time when scheduling multiple jobs simultaneously may be possible. This option may improve system responsiveness when large numbers of jobs (many hundreds) are submitted at the same time, but it will delay the initiation time of individual jobs. Also see <strong>default_queue_depth</strong> above.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Ignore_NUMA</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Some processors (e.g. AMD Opteron 6000 series) contain multiple NUMA nodes per socket. This is a configuration which does not map into the hardware entities that Slurm optimizes resource allocation for (PU/thread, core, socket, baseboard, node and network switch). In order to optimize resource allocations on such hardware, Slurm will consider each NUMA node within the socket as a separate socket by default. Use the Ignore_NUMA option to report the correct socket count, but <strong>not</strong> optimize resource allocations on the NUMA nodes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>max_depend_depth=#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Maximum number of jobs to test for a circular job dependency. Stop testing after this number of job dependencies have been tested. The default value is 10 jobs.</p>

    <p><strong>max_rpc_cnt=#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the number of active threads in the slurmctld daemon is equal to or larger than this value, defer scheduling of jobs. This can improve Slurm's ability to process requests at a cost of initiating new jobs less frequently. The default value is zero, which disables this option. If a value is set, then a value of 10 or higher is recommended.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>max_sched_time=#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>How long, in seconds, that the main scheduling loop will execute for before exiting. If a value is configured, be aware that all other Slurm operations will be deferred during this time period. Make certain the value is lower than <strong>MessageTimeout</strong>. If a value is not explicitly configured, the default value is half of <strong>MessageTimeout</strong> with a minimum default value of 1 second and a maximum default value of 4 seconds. For example if MessageTimeout=10, the time limit will be 4 seconds (i.e. MIN(10/2, 4) = 4).</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>max_switch_wait=#</strong></p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>partition_job_depth=#</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The default number of jobs to attempt scheduling (i.e. the queue depth) from each partition/queue in Slurm's main scheduling logic. The functionality is similar to that provided by the <strong>bf_max_job_part</strong> option for the backfill scheduling logic. The default value is 0 (no limit). Job's excluded from attempted scheduling based upon partition will not be counted against the <strong>default_queue_depth</strong> limit. Also see the <strong>bf_max_job_part</strong> option.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>For a backfill scheduling module to augment the default FIFO scheduling. Backfill scheduling will initiate lower-priority jobs if doing so does not delay the expected initiation time of any higher priority job. Effectiveness of backfill scheduling is dependent upon users specifying job time limits, otherwise all jobs will have the same time limit and backfilling is impossible. Note documentation for the <strong>SchedulerParameters</strong> option above. This is the default configuration.</p>

    <p>This is the FIFO scheduler which initiates jobs in priority order. If any job in the partition can not be scheduled, no lower priority job in that partition will be scheduled. An exception is made for jobs can not run due to partition constraints (e.g. the time limit) or down/drained nodes. In that case, lower priority jobs can be initiated and not impact the higher priority job.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>The rate at which nodes are place into power save mode by <strong>SuspendProgram</strong>. The value is number of nodes per minute and it can be used to prevent a large drop in power power consumption (e.g. after a large job completes). A value of zero results in no limits being imposed. The default value is 60 nodes per minute.

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>TreeWidth</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>Slurmd</strong> daemons use a virtual tree network for communications. <strong>TreeWidth</strong> specifies the width of the tree (i.e. the fanout). On architectures with a front end node running the slurmd daemon, the value must always be equal to or greater than the number of front end nodes which eliminates the need for message forwarding between the slurmd daemons. On other architectures the default value is 50, meaning each slurmd daemon can communicate with up to 50 other slurmd daemons and over 2500 nodes can be contacted with two message hops. The default value will work well for most clusters. Optimal system performance can typically be achieved if <strong>TreeWidth</strong> is set to the square root of the number of nodes in the cluster for systems having no more than 2500 nodes or the cube root for larger systems. The value may not exceed 65533.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>UnkillableStepProgram</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the processes in a job step are determined to be unkillable for a period of time specified by the <strong>UnkillableStepTimeout</strong> variable, the program specified by <strong>UnkillableStepProgram</strong> will be executed. This program can be used to take special actions to clean up the unkillable processes and/or notify computer administrators. The program will be run <strong>SlurmdUser</strong> (usually "root") on the compute node. By default no program is run.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>UnkillableStepTimeout</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The length of time, in seconds, that SLURM will wait before deciding that processes in a job step are unkillable (after they have been signaled with SIGKILL) and execute <strong>UnkillableStepProgram</strong> as described above. The default timeout value is 60 seconds.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>UsePAM</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If set to 1, PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux) will be enabled. PAM is used to establish the upper bounds for resource limits. With PAM support enabled, local system administrators can dynamically configure system resource limits. Changing the upper bound of a resource limit will not alter the limits of running jobs, only jobs started after a change has been made will pick up the new limits. The default value is 0 (not to enable PAM support). Remember that PAM also needs to be configured to support SLURM as a service. For sites using PAM's directory based configuration option, a configuration file named <strong>slurm</strong> should be created. The module-type, control-flags, and module-path names that should be included in the file are:</p><p>auth        required      pam_localuser.so</p><p>auth        required      pam_shells.so</p><p>account     required      pam_unix.so</p><p>account     required      pam_access.so</p><p>session     required      pam_unix.so</p><p>For sites configuring PAM with a general configuration file, the appropriate lines (see above), where <strong>slurm</strong> is the service-name, should be added.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>VSizeFactor</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Memory specifications in job requests apply to real memory size (also known as resident set size). It is possible to enforce virtual memory limits for both jobs and job steps by limiting their virtual memory to some percentage of their real memory allocation. The <strong>VSizeFactor</strong> parameter specifies the job's or job step's virtual memory limit as a percentage of its real memory limit. For example, if a job's real memory limit is 500MB and VSizeFactor is set to 101 then the job will be killed if its real memory exceeds 500MB or its virtual memory exceeds 505MB (101 percent of the real memory limit). The default valus is 0, which disables enforcement of virtual memory limits. The value may not exceed 65533 percent.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>WaitTime</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies how many seconds the srun command should by default wait after the first task terminates before terminating all remaining tasks. The "--wait" option on the srun command line overrides this value. The default value is 0, which disables this feature. May not exceed 65533 seconds.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The configuration of nodes (or machines) to be managed by SLURM is also specified in <strong>/etc/slurm.conf</strong>. Changes in node configuration (e.g. adding nodes, changing their processor count, etc.) require restarting both the slurmctld daemon and the slurmd daemons. All slurmd daemons must know each node in the system to forward messages in support of hierarchical communications. Only the NodeName must be supplied in the configuration file. All other node configuration information is optional. It is advisable to establish baseline node configurations, especially if the cluster is heterogeneous. Nodes which register to the system with less than the configured resources (e.g. too little memory), will be placed in the "DOWN" state to avoid scheduling jobs on them. Establishing baseline configurations will also speed SLURM's scheduling process by permitting it to compare job requirements against these (relatively few) configuration parameters and possibly avoid having to check job requirements against every individual node's configuration. The resources checked at node registration time are: CPUs, RealMemory and TmpDisk. While baseline values for each of these can be established in the configuration file, the actual values upon node registration are recorded and these actual values may be used for scheduling purposes (depending upon the value of <strong>FastSchedule</strong> in the configuration file.</p><p>Default values can be specified with a record in which <strong>NodeName</strong> is "DEFAULT". The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times in the configuration file with multiple entries where "NodeName=DEFAULT". Each line where <strong>NodeName</strong> is "DEFAULT" will replace or add to previous default values and not a reinitialize the default values. The "NodeName=" specification must be placed on every line describing the configuration of nodes. A single node name can not appear as a NodeName value in more than one line (duplicate node name records will be ignored). In fact, it is generally possible and desirable to define the configurations of all nodes in only a few lines. This convention permits significant optimization in the scheduling of larger clusters. In order to support the concept of jobs requiring consecutive nodes on some architectures, node specifications should be place in this file in consecutive order. No single node name may be listed more than once in the configuration file. Use "DownNodes=" to record the state of nodes which are temporarily in a DOWN, DRAIN or FAILING state without altering permanent configuration information. A job step's tasks are allocated to nodes in order the nodes appear in the configuration file. There is presently no capability within SLURM to arbitrarily order a job step's tasks.</p><p>Multiple node names may be comma separated (e.g. "alpha,beta,gamma") and/or a simple node range expression may optionally be used to specify numeric ranges of nodes to avoid building a configuration file with large numbers of entries. The node range expression can contain one  pair of square brackets with a sequence of comma separated numbers and/or ranges of numbers separated by a "-" (e.g. "linux[0-64,128]", or "lx[15,18,32-33]"). Note that the numeric ranges can include one or more leading zeros to indicate the numeric portion has a fixed number of digits (e.g. "linux[0000-1023]"). Up to two numeric ranges can be included in the expression (e.g. "rack[0-63]_blade[0-41]"). If one or more numeric expressions are included, one of them must be at the end of the name (e.g. "unit[0-31]rack" is invalid), but arbitrary names can always be used in a comma separated list.</p><p>On BlueGene systems only, the square brackets should contain pairs of three digit numbers separated by a "x". These numbers indicate the boundaries of a rectangular prism (e.g. "bgl[000x144,400x544]"). See BlueGene documentation for more details. The node configuration specified the following information:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>NodeName</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Name that SLURM uses to refer to a node (or base partition for BlueGene systems). Typically this would be the string that "/bin/hostname -s" returns. It may also be the fully qualified domain name as returned by "/bin/hostname -f" (e.g. "foo1.bar.com"), or any valid domain name associated with the host through the host database (/etc/hosts) or DNS, depending on the resolver settings.  Note that if the short form of the hostname is not used, it may prevent use of hostlist expressions (the numeric portion in brackets must be at the end of the string). Only short hostname forms are compatible with the switch/elan, switch/federation and switch/nrt plugins at this time. It may also be an arbitrary string if <strong>NodeHostname</strong> is specified. If the <strong>NodeName</strong> is "DEFAULT", the values specified with that record will apply to subsequent node specifications unless explicitly set to other values in that node record or replaced with a different set of default values. Each line where <strong>NodeName</strong> is "DEFAULT" will replace or add to previous default values and not a reinitialize the default values. For architectures in which the node order is significant, nodes will be considered consecutive in the order defined. For example, if the configuration for "NodeName=charlie" immediately follows the configuration for "NodeName=baker" they will be considered adjacent in the computer.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>NodeHostname</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Typically this would be the string that "/bin/hostname -s" returns.

Note that if the short form of the hostname is not used, it may prevent use of hostlist expressions (the numeric portion in brackets must be at the end of the string). Only short hostname forms are compatible with the switch/elan, switch/federation and switch/nrt plugins at this time. A node range expression can be used to specify a set of nodes. If an expression is used, the number of nodes identified by <strong>NodeHostname</strong> on a line in the configuration file must be identical to the number of nodes identified by <strong>NodeName</strong>. By default, the <strong>NodeHostname</strong> will be identical in value to <strong>NodeName</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>ThreadsPerCore</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Number of logical threads in a single physical core (e.g. "2"). Note that the SLURM can allocate resources to jobs down to the resolution of a core. If your system is configured with more than one thread per core, execution of a different job on each thread is not supported unless you configure <strong>SelectTypeParameters=CR_CPU</strong> plus <strong>CPUs</strong>; do not configure <strong>Sockets</strong>, <strong>CoresPerSocket</strong> or <strong>ThreadsPerCore</strong>. A job can execute a one task per thread from within one job step or execute a distinct job step on each of the threads. Note also if you are running with more than 1 thread per core and running the select/cons_res plugin you will want to set the SelectTypeParameters variable to something other than CR_CPU to avoid unexpected results. The default value is 1.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>TmpDisk</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Total size of temporary disk storage in <strong>TmpFS</strong> in MegaBytes (e.g. "16384"). <strong>TmpFS</strong> (for "Temporary File System") identifies the location which jobs should use for temporary storage. Note this does not indicate the amount of free space available to the user on the node, only the total file system size. The system administration should insure this file system is purged as needed so that user jobs have access to most of this space. The Prolog and/or Epilog programs (specified in the configuration file) might be used to insure the file system is kept clean. The default value is 0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Weight</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The priority of the node for scheduling purposes. All things being equal, jobs will be allocated the nodes with the lowest weight which satisfies their requirements. For example, a heterogeneous collection of nodes might be placed into a single partition for greater system utilization, responsiveness and capability. It would be preferable to allocate smaller memory nodes rather than larger memory nodes if either will satisfy a job's requirements. The units of weight are arbitrary, but larger weights should be assigned to nodes with more processors, memory, disk space, higher processor speed, etc. Note that if a job allocation request can not be satisfied using the nodes with the lowest weight, the set of nodes with the next lowest weight is added to the set of nodes under consideration for use (repeat as needed for higher weight values). If you absolutely want to minimize the number of higher weight nodes allocated to a job (at a cost of higher scheduling overhead), give each node a distinct <strong>Weight</strong> value and they will be added to the pool of nodes being considered for scheduling individually. The default value is 1.</p>

<p>On computers where frontend nodes are used to execute batch scripts rather than compute nodes (BlueGene or Cray systems), one may configure one or more frontend nodes using the configuration parameters defined below. These options are very similar to those used in configuring compute nodes. These options may only be used on systems configured and built with the appropriate parameters (--have-front-end, --enable-bluegene-emulation) or a system determined to have the appropriate architecture by the configure script (BlueGene or Cray systems). The front end configuration specifies the following information:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AllowGroups</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Comma separated list of group names which may execute jobs on this front end node. By default, all groups may use this front end node. If <strong>at least</strong> one group associated with the user attempting to execute the job is in AllowGroups, he will be permitted to use this front end node. May not be used with the <strong>DenyGroups</strong> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AllowUsers</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Comma separated list of user names which may execute jobs on this front end node. By default, all users may use this front end node. May not be used with the <strong>DenyUsers</strong> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>DenyGroups</strong></p>
  </dt>

    <p>Comma separated list of group names which are prevented from executing jobs on this front end node. May not be used with the <strong>AllowGroups</strong> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>DenyUsers</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Comma separated list of user names which are prevented from executing jobs on this front end node. May not be used with the <strong>AllowUsers</strong> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>FrontendName</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Name that SLURM uses to refer to a frontend node. Typically this would be the string that "/bin/hostname -s" returns. It may also be the fully qualified domain name as returned by "/bin/hostname -f" (e.g. "foo1.bar.com"), or any valid domain name associated with the host through the host database (/etc/hosts) or DNS, depending on the resolver settings.  Note that if the short form of the hostname is not used, it may prevent use of hostlist expressions (the numeric portion in brackets must be at the end of the string). If the <strong>FrontendName</strong> is "DEFAULT", the values specified with that record will apply to subsequent node specifications unless explicitly set to other values in that frontend node record or replaced with a different set of default values. Each line where <strong>FrontendName</strong> is "DEFAULT" will replace or add to previous default values and not a reinitialize the default values. Note that since the naming of front end nodes would typically not follow that of the compute nodes (e.g. lacking X, Y and Z coordinates found in the compute node naming scheme), each front end node name should be listed separately and without a hostlist expression (i.e. frontend00,frontend01" rather than "frontend[00-01]").&lt;/p&gt;</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>FrontendAddr</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Name that a frontend node should be referred to in establishing a communications path. This name will be used as an argument to the gethostbyname() function for identification. As with <strong>FrontendName</strong>, list the individual node addresses rather than using a hostlist expression. The number of <strong>FrontendAddr</strong> records per line must equal the number of <strong>FrontendName</strong> records per line (i.e. you can't map to node names to one address). <strong>FrontendAddr</strong> may also contain IP addresses. By default, the <strong>FrontendAddr</strong> will be identical in value to <strong>FrontendName</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Port</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The port number that the SLURM compute node daemon, <strong>slurmd</strong>, listens to for work on this particular frontend node. By default there is a single port number for all <strong>slurmd</strong> daemons on all frontend nodes as defined by the <strong>SlurmdPort</strong> configuration parameter. Use of this option is not generally recommended except for development or testing purposes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Reason</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Identifies the reason for a frontend node being in state "DOWN", "DRAINED" "DRAINING", "FAIL" or "FAILING". Use quotes to enclose a reason having more than one word.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>State</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>State of the frontend node with respect to the initiation of user jobs. Acceptable values are "DOWN", "DRAIN", "FAIL", "FAILING" and "UNKNOWN". "DOWN" indicates the frontend node has failed and is unavailable to be allocated work. "DRAIN" indicates the frontend node is unavailable to be allocated work. "FAIL" indicates the frontend node is expected to fail soon, has no jobs allocated to it, and will not be allocated to any new jobs. "FAILING" indicates the frontend node is expected to fail soon, has one or more jobs allocated to it, but will not be allocated to any new jobs. "UNKNOWN" indicates the frontend node's state is undefined (BUSY or IDLE), but will be established when the <strong>slurmd</strong> daemon on that node registers. The default value is "UNKNOWN". Also see the <strong>DownNodes</strong> parameter below.</p><p>For example: "FrontendName=frontend[00-03] FrontendAddr=efrontend[00-03] State=UNKNOWN" is used to define four front end nodes for running slurmd daemons.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<p>The partition configuration permits you to establish different job limits or access controls for various groups (or partitions) of nodes. Nodes may be in more than one partition, making partitions serve as general purpose queues. For example one may put the same set of nodes into two different partitions, each with different constraints (time limit, job sizes, groups allowed to use the partition, etc.). Jobs are allocated resources within a single partition. Default values can be specified with a record in which <strong>PartitionName</strong> is "DEFAULT". The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times in the configuration file with multiple entries where "PartitionName=DEFAULT". The "PartitionName=" specification must be placed on every line describing the configuration of partitions. Each line where <strong>PartitionName</strong> is "DEFAULT" will replace or add to previous default values and not a reinitialize the default values. A single partition name can not appear as a PartitionName value in more than one line (duplicate partition name records will be ignored). If a partition that is in use is deleted from the configuration and slurm is restarted or reconfigured (scontrol reconfigure), jobs using the partition are canceled. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Put all parameters for each partition on a single line. Each line of partition configuration information should represent a different partition. The partition configuration file contains the following information:</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AllocNodes</strong></p>

    <p><strong>AllowAccounts</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Comma separated list of accounts which may execute jobs in the partition. The default value is "ALL". <strong>NOTE:</strong> If AllowAccounts is used then DenyAccounts will not be enforced. Also refer to DenyAccounts.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AllowGroups</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Comma separated list of group names which may execute jobs in the partition. If <strong>at least</strong> one group associated with the user attempting to execute the job is in AllowGroups, he will be permitted to use this partition. Jobs executed as user root can use any partition without regard to the value of AllowGroups. If user root attempts to execute a job as another user (e.g. using srun's --uid option), this other user must be in one of groups identified by AllowGroups for the job to successfully execute. The default value is "ALL". <strong>NOTE:</strong> For performance reasons, SLURM maintains a list of user IDs allowed to use each partition and this is checked at job submission time. This list of user IDs is updated when the <strong>slurmctld</strong> daemon is restarted, reconfigured (e.g. "scontrol reconfig") or the partition's <strong>AllowGroups</strong> value is reset, even if is value is unchanged (e.g. "scontrol update PartitionName=name AllowGroups=group"). For a user's access to a partition to change, both his group membership must change and SLURM's internal user ID list must change using one of the methods described above.</p>

    <p><strong>LLN</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Schedule resources to jobs on the least loaded nodes (based upon the number of idle CPUs).

    <p><strong>PreemptMode</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Mechanism used to preempt jobs from this partition when <strong>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</strong> is configured. This partition specific <strong>PreemptMode</strong> configuration parameter will override the <strong>PreemptMode</strong> configuration parameter set for the cluster as a whole. The cluster-level <strong>PreemptMode</strong> must include the GANG option if <strong>PreemptMode</strong> is configured to SUSPEND for any partition. The cluster-level <strong>PreemptMode</strong> must not be OFF if <strong>PreemptMode</strong> is enabled for any  partition. See the description of the cluster-level <strong>PreemptMode</strong> configuration parameter above for further information.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Priority</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Jobs submitted to a higher priority partition will be dispatched before pending jobs in lower priority partitions and if possible they will preempt running jobs from lower priority partitions.

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ReqResv</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies users of this partition are required to designate a reservation when submitting a job. This option can be useful in restricting usage of a partition that may have higher priority or additional resources to be allowed only within a reservation. Possible values are "YES" and "NO". The default value is "NO".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>RootOnly</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies if only user ID zero (i.e. user <em>root</em>) may allocate resources in this partition. User root may allocate resources for any other user, but the request must be initiated by user root. This option can be useful for a partition to be managed by some external entity (e.g. a higher-level job manager) and prevents users from directly using those resources. Possible values are "YES" and "NO". The default value is "NO".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>SelectTypeParameters</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Partition-specific resource allocation type. Supported values are <strong>CR_Core</strong> and <strong>CR_Socket</strong>. Use requires the system-wide <strong>SelectTypeParameters</strong> value be set plus <strong>CR_ALLOCATE_FULL_SOCKET</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Shared</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Controls the ability of the partition to execute more than one job at a time on each resource (node, socket or core depending upon the value of <strong>SelectTypeParameters</strong>). If resources are to be shared, avoiding memory over-subscription is very important. <strong>SelectTypeParameters</strong> should be configured to treat memory as a consumable resource and the <strong>--mem</strong> option should be used for job allocations. Sharing of resources is typically useful only when using gang scheduling (<strong>PreemptMode=suspend</strong> or <strong>PreemptMode=kill</strong>). Possible values for <strong>Shared</strong> are "EXCLUSIVE", "FORCE", "YES", and "NO". Note that a value of "YES" or "FORCE" can negatively impact performance for systems with many thousands of running jobs. The default value is "NO". For more information see the following web pages:</p><p><em>http://slurm.schedmd.com/cons_res.html</em>,</p><p><em>http://slurm.schedmd.com/cons_res_share.html</em>,</p><p><em>http://slurm.schedmd.com/gang_scheduling.html</em>, and</p><p><em>http://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html</em>.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">Prolog and Epilog Scripts</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>There are a variety of prolog and epilog program options that execute with various permissions and at various times. The four options most likely to be used are: <strong>Prolog</strong> and <strong>Epilog</strong> (executed once on each compute node for each job) plus <strong>PrologSlurmctld</strong> and <strong>EpilogSlurmctld</strong> (executed once on the <strong>ControlMachine</strong> for each job).</p><p>NOTE:  Standard output and error messages are normally not preserved. Explicitly write output and error messages to an appropriate location if you wish to preserve that information.</p><p>NOTE:  The Prolog script is ONLY run on any individual node when it first sees a job step from a new allocation; it does not run the Prolog immediately when an allocation is granted.  If no job steps from an allocation are run on a node, it will never run the Prolog for that allocation.  The Epilog, on the other hand, always runs on every node of an allocation when the allocation is released.</p><p>If the Epilog fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will result in the node being set to a DRAIN state. If the EpilogSlurmctld fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will only be logged. If the Prolog fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will result in the node being set to a DRAIN state and the job requeued to executed on another node. If the PrologSlurmctld fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will result in the job requeued to executed on another node if possible. Only batch jobs can be requeued. Interactive jobs (salloc and srun) will be cancelled if the PrologSlurmctld fails.</p><p>Information about the job is passed to the script using environment variables. Unless otherwise specified, these environment variables are available to all of the programs.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">NETWORK TOPOLOGY</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>SLURM is able to optimize job allocations to minimize network contention. Special SLURM logic is used to optimize allocations on systems with a three-dimensional interconnect (BlueGene, Sun Constellation, etc.) and information about configuring those systems are available on web pages available here: &lt;http://slurm.schedmd.com/&gt;. For a hierarchical network, SLURM needs to have detailed information about how nodes are configured on the network switches.</p><p>Given network topology information, SLURM allocates all of a job's resources onto a single leaf of the network (if possible) using a best-fit algorithm. Otherwise it will allocate a job's resources onto multiple leaf switches so as to minimize the use of higher-level switches. The <strong>TopologyPlugin</strong> parameter controls which plugin is used to collect network topology information. The only values presently supported are "topology/3d_torus" (default for IBM BlueGene, Sun Constellation and Cray XT/XE systems, performs best-fit logic over three-dimensional topology), "topology/none" (default for other systems, best-fit logic over one-dimensional topology), "topology/tree" (determine the network topology based upon information contained in a topology.conf file, see "man topology.conf" for more information). Future plugins may gather topology information directly from the network. The topology information is optional. If not provided, SLURM will perform a best-fit algorithm assuming the nodes are in a one-dimensional array as configured and the communications cost is related to the node distance in this array.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">RELOCATING CONTROLLERS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>If the cluster's computers used for the primary or backup controller will be out of service for an extended period of time, it may be desirable to relocate them. In order to do so, follow this procedure:</p><p>1. Stop the SLURM daemons</p><p>2. Modify the slurm.conf file appropriately</p><p>3. Distribute the updated slurm.conf file to all nodes</p><p>4. Restart the SLURM daemons</p><p>There should be no loss of any running or pending jobs. Insure that any nodes added to the cluster have the current slurm.conf file installed.</p><p><strong>CAUTION:</strong> If two nodes are simultaneously configured as the primary controller (two nodes on which <strong>ControlMachine</strong> specify the local host and the <strong>slurmctld</strong> daemon is executing on each), system behavior will be destructive. If a compute node has an incorrect <strong>ControlMachine</strong> or <strong>BackupController</strong> parameter, that node may be rendered unusable, but no other harm will result.</p>
