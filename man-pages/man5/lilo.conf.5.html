<p>This file, by default <em>/etc/lilo.conf</em>, is read by the boot loader installer 'lilo' (see <a href="../man8/lilo.8.html"><strong>lilo</strong>(8)</a>).</p><p>It might look as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<pre>
# /etc/lilo.conf

</li>
</ul><p>This configuration file specifies that lilo uses the Master Boot Record on /dev/hda. (For a discussion of the various ways to use lilo, and the interaction with other operating systems, see html/user_21-5.html inside the old documentation.)</p><p>When booting, the boot loader will issue its <em>boot:</em> prompt and wait for you to enter the label of the kernel (and any options) which you wish to boot. At any time you may hit [Tab] to see a list of kernel/other labels. Alternately, if the <strong>menu</strong> boot loader is installed, a menu of boot options will be presented for your selection. The title of this menu is overridden with the menu title specification in this configuration file. If you enter nothing, then the default kernel image, the first mentioned, (in the example /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.29-1-i386) will be booted after a timeout of 15 seconds (150 deciseconds). There may be at least 16 images mentioned in lilo.conf. (The exact number depends upon compilation options.)</p><p>As can be seen above, a configuration file starts with a number of global options (the top 9 lines in the example), followed by descriptions of the options for the various images. An option in an image description will override a global option.</p><p>Comment lines may appear anywhere, and begin with the "#" character.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">GLOBAL OPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>There are many possible keywords. The description below is almost literally from html/user_21-5.html inside the old documentation (just slightly abbreviated).</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>backup=</strong><em>&lt;backup-file&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies the location where a copy of any modified boot sector will be saved in a file. 'backup=' may specify this location in one of three ways: a directory where the default backup file 'boot.NNNN' will be created; a file pathname template to which the '.NNNN' suffix will be added; or the full file pathname, which must include the correct '.NNNN' suffix. All RAID installations should use only the first two alternatives, as multiple backups may be created.  The '.NNNN' suffix is the hexadecimal representation of the major and minor device numbers of the device or partition. If this option is not specified, the default name of boot sector backups is '/boot/boot.NNNN'. If a backup already exists, it will be preserved, rather than overwritten.  C.f., <strong>force-backup=</strong> below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bios-passes-dl=</strong><em>&lt;option&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The option is indicated as <em>yes</em>, <em>no</em>, or <em>unknown</em>.  If not specified, a value of "unknown" is assumed, unless additional information is available to the boot installer. When "no" is specified, it indicates that the BIOS is known not to pass the current boot device code to the boot loader in the DL register.  Its only function at this point is experimental, as certain RAID installations may benefit from knowing that the BIOS is 100% reliable.  Its use should be considered experimental.</p><p>This option may be specified on the command line with the '-Z' switch: yes=1, no=0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bitmap=</strong><em>&lt;bitmap-file&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies use of a 640x480x16 (VGA BIOS) or 640x480x256 (VGA/VESA BIOS) bitmap file as the background on which a boot menu is displayed.  May not be used if 'message=' is specified. Use of this option will select a bitmap-capable boot loader, unless overridden with "install=" (see below).</p><p>When a bitmap file is specified as a background screen during the boot process, the color selection and layout of the text which overlays the graphic image must be specified in one of two ways.</p><p>One way is the use of header information in the bitmap image (*.bmp) file: From a text file with all the information about 'bmp-colors', 'bmp-table' and 'bmp-timer' options together with the 'bitmap' option are stored in the special LILO  header of the bitmap image file by the <strong>lilo -E</strong> command. Another way works without these special header information: All the information about 'bmp-colors', 'bmp-table' and 'bmp-timer' options together with the 'bitmap' option are stored in the configuration file. Any use of the 'bmp-' options within the configuration file overrides the options stored in the bitmap file header. If lilo cannot find any of the 'bmp-' options, then default values are used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bmp-colors=</strong><em>&lt;fg&gt;,&lt;bg&gt;,&lt;sh&gt;,&lt;hfg&gt;,&lt;hbg&gt;,&lt;hsh&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies the decimal values of the colors to be used for the menu display on a 'bitmap=' background.  The list consists of 6 entries, 3 for normal text followed by 3 for highlighted text.  The order of each triple is: foreground color, background color, shadow color.  If background color is not specified, "transparent" is assumed.  If shadow color is not specified, then "none" is assumed.  The list entries are separated by commas, with no spaces.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bmp-retain</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Option applies to all 'image=' and 'other=' sections. (See COMMON OPTIONS, below.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bmp-table=</strong><em>&lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;,&lt;ncol&gt;,&lt;nrow&gt;,&lt;xsep&gt;,&lt;spill&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies the location and layout of the menu table.  &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt; specify the starting x- and y-position of the upper left corner of the table in character coordinates: x in [1..80], y in [1..30]. &lt;ncol&gt; is the number of columns in the menu (1..5); and &lt;nrow&gt; is the number of rows (entries) in each column. If more than one column is specified, then &lt;xsep&gt; is the number of character columns between the leftmost characters in each column: (18..40), and &lt;spill&gt; is the number of entries in one column which must be filled before entries spill into the next column. &lt;spill&gt; must be .le. &lt;nrow&gt;. If pixel addressing is used, instead of character addressing, then any of &lt;x&gt;, &lt;y&gt;, or &lt;xsep&gt; may be specified with a 'p' suffix on the decimal value.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bmp-timer=</strong><em>&lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;,&lt;fg&gt;,&lt;bg&gt;,&lt;sh&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Optional specification of the 'timeout=' countdown timer.  &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt; specifies the character (or pixel) coordinate of the location of the timer the same as 'bmp-table=' above; and the color triple specifies the character color attributes the same as 'bmp-colors=' above, with the exception that the background color <em>must</em> be specified.  If used to override the timer specification in a bitmap file, then the form 'bmp-timer = none' is acceptable.  This will disable the timer display entirely.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>boot=</strong><em>&lt;boot-device&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Sets the name of the device (e.g. hard disk or partition) that contains the boot sector and where the new boot sector should be written to. Notice: The boot-device should be the device with the currently mounted root partition.</p><p>A raid installation is initiated by specifying a RAID1 device as the boot device; e.g., "boot=/dev/md0".</p><p>On newer systems you need an unique ID for the boot device. If the boot sector should write to a partition you can use its UUID in the same manner is for the root options.</p><p>If your boot device is a hard disk you need a special ID, which is supported by udev. You find the right ID in the directory /dev/disks/by-id, i. e.:</p><ul>
<li>
<pre>
    boot = /dev/disk/by-id/ata-SAMSUNG_SV1604N_S01FJ10X999999
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>change-rules</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Defines boot-time changes to partition type numbers (`hiding').</p><ul>
<li>
<pre>
change-rules
   reset
   type=DOS12
      normal=1
      hidden=0x11
   type=DOS16_small
      normal=4
      hidden=0x14
   type=DOS16_big
      normal=0x06
      hidden=0x16
</pre>
</li><li><p>The above excerpt from a configuration file specifies that all default <em>change-rules</em> are removed ("reset"), and the change-rules for three partition types are specified.  Without the <em>reset</em>, the three types specified would have been added to the existing default change-rules.  Normally, the default rules are sufficient.  The strings which define the partition types are used in a <em>change</em> section (see below), with the suffixes "_normal" or "_hidden" appended. See section "Partition type change rules" of html/user_21-5.html inside the old documentation for more details.</p></li>
</ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>compact</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Tries to merge read requests for adjacent sectors into a single read request. This drastically reduces load time and keeps the map file smaller. Using `compact' is especially recommended when booting using a map file on a floppy disk.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>default=</strong><em>&lt;name&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Uses the specified image as the default boot image. If `default' is omitted, the image appearing first in the configuration file is used. See also, <em>vmdefault</em> below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>delay=</strong><em>&lt;tsecs&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies the number of tenths of a second the boot loader should wait before automatically booting a locked command line, a command line pre-stored by "lilo -R", or the default `image=' or `other='. When `delay' is non-zero, the boot loader will wait for an interrupt for the specified interval. If an interrupt is received, or is already waiting, the <strong>boot:</strong> prompt will be be issued, and no automatic boot will take place. The setting of CAPS LOCK or SCROLL LOCK, or any of the keys ALT, CTRL, or SHIFT, when held down, are taken as interrupts.</p><p>This action is modified by specifying `prompt' (see below).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>disk=</strong><em>&lt;device-name&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Defines non-standard parameters for the specified disk. See section "Disk geometry" of html/user_21-5.html inside the old documentation for details. For versions of LILO prior to 22.5, the `bios=' parameter is quite useful for specifying how the BIOS has assigned device codes to your disks. For example,</p>
<pre>
       disk=/dev/sda
            bios=0x80
       disk=/dev/hda
            bios=0x81
       disk=/dev/sdb
            inaccessible
</pre>
<p>would say that your SCSI disk is the first BIOS disk (0x80), that your (primary master) IDE disk is the second BIOS disk (0x81), and that your second SCSI disk (perhaps a USB device) receives no device code, and is therefore inaccessible at boot time.</p><p>NOTE: Use of the 'bios=' option is largely obsolete beginning with LILO version 22.5, as the boot loader now identifies disks by 32-bit Volume-ID, and defers BIOS device code determination until boot time.</p><p>Other options include the specification of disk geometry; e.g.,</p>
<pre>
       disk=/dev/fd0
            sectors=18
            heads=2
            cylinders=80
</pre>
<p>probably only useful for floppy disks and loopback devices, because for hard disks the <strong>lba32</strong> disk addressing option ignores disk geometry.</p><p>Developers who have implemented a disk driver for a new block storage device will have to indicate to LILO the maximum number of partitions on the device.  This is in addition to making all of the necessary entries for the device in the "/dev" directory (with 'mknod').  The maximum number of partitions must be one of 63 (like an IDE disk), 31 (uncommon), 15 (like SCSI disks -- most common value), or 7 (like one array controller). An example specification would be:</p>
<pre>
     disk=/dev/userd0
          max-partitions=15
</pre>
<p>In cases where there is no kernel partition information available, such as on loopback devices, the 'disk=' specification may include paritition start information; viz.,</p>
<pre>
       disk=/dev/loop0
            bios=0x80			# use this BIOS code
            max-partitions=7		# declare partitionable
            paritition=/dev/loop1
                 start=63		# offset from sector 0
            paritition=/dev/loop2
                 start=102400		# offset from sector 0
</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>disktab=</strong><em>&lt;disktab-file&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies the name of the disk parameter table. The map installer looks for <em>/etc/disktab</em> if `disktab' is omitted. The use of disktabs is discouraged.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>el-torito-bootable-CD</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Flag second stage loader to terminate disk emulation when booting from an El Torito Bootable CD. This option is used by the <strong>mkrescue</strong> utility when the "--iso" switch is specified.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>fix-table</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This allows lilo to adjust 3D addresses in partition tables. Each partition entry contains a 3D (cylinder/head/sector) and a linear address of the first and the last sector of the partition. If a partition is not track-aligned and if certain other operating systems (e.g. PC/MS-DOS) are using the same disk, they may change the 3D address. lilo can store its boot sector only on partitions where both address types correspond. lilo re-adjusts incorrect 3D start addresses if `fix-table' is set.</p><p>WARNING: This does not guarantee that other operating systems may not attempt to reset the address later. It is also possible that this change has other, unexpected side-effects. The correct fix is to re-partition the drive with a program that does align partitions to tracks. Also, with some disks (e.g. some large EIDE disks with address translation enabled), under some circumstances, it may even be unavoidable to have conflicting partition table entries.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>force-backup=</strong><em>&lt;backup-file&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Operation is identical to <strong>backup=</strong> above, except an existing backup file is unconditionally overwritten if it exists.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>geometric</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Force disk addressing which is compatible with older versions of LILO. Geometric addressing uses cylinder/head/sector addresses, and is limited to disk cylinders up to 1023.  If inaccessible cylinders are referenced, diagnostics will be issued at boot-install time, rather than boot-time. With a newer BIOS, use of 'lba32' is recommended.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ignore-table</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>tells lilo to ignore corrupt partition tables.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>install=</strong><em>&lt;user-interface&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Selects the user interface which will be seen at boot time.  One of the following three options may be specified:  <strong>text</strong>, <strong>menu</strong>, or <strong>bmp</strong>. The traditional LILO interface is `text'; but `menu' is now the default, unless the configuration file contains the `bitmap=' specification.  The <em>text</em> interface is strictly a command-line interface as though the console were a dumb terminal.  The <em>menu</em> interface is a text-based screen of the boot choices, with the option to enter additional command line parameters.  And the <em>bmp</em> interface is a menu presented against a graphic screen, specified as a 640x480 BitMaP file of 16 or 256 colors.  (See the 'lilo -E' switch for editing options).</p><p>(Prior to LILO version 22.3, `install=' specified the user interface as a file in the `/boot' directory.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>large-memory</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Normally any initial ramdisk (initrd) loaded with a kernel is loaded as high in memory as possible, but never above 15Mb.  This is due to a BIOS limitation on older systems.  On newer systems, this option enables using memory above 15Mb (up to a kernel imposed limit, around 768Mb) for passing the initrd to the kernel.  The presence of this option merely indicates that your system does not have the old BIOS limitation.</p><p>This switch (or its absence) is not passed to the kernel, and does not in any way affect the amount of physical memory which it will use.  (See the kernel documentation for the kernel command line parameter "mem=" for limiting the memory used by the kernel.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>lba32</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Generate 32-bit Logical Block Addresses instead of cylinder/head/sector addresses. If the BIOS supports packet addressing, then packet calls will be used to access the disk. This allows booting from any partition on disks with more than 1024 cylinders. If the BIOS does not support packet addressing, then 'lba32' addresses are translated to cylinder/head/sector ('geometric'), just as for 'linear'. All floppy disk references are retained in C:H:S form.  Use of 'lba32' is recommended on all post-1998 systems.  Beginning with LILO version 22, 'lba32' is the default disk addressing scheme.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>linear</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>

The &lt;option&gt; may be specified as <em>none</em>, <em>auto</em>, <em>mbr</em>, <em>mbr-only</em>, or a comma-separated list of devices; e.g., "/dev/hda,/dev/hdc6".  Starting with LILO version 22.0, the boot record is normally written to the first sector of the RAID1 partition.  On PARALLEL raid sets, no other boot records are needed.  The default action is <em>auto</em>, meaning, automatically generate auxiliary boot records as needed on SKEWED raid sets.  <em>none</em> means suppress generation of all auxiliary boot records. <em>mbr-only</em> suppresses generation of a boot record on the raid device, and forces compatibility with versions of LILO earlier than version 22.0 by writing boot records to all Master Boot Records (MBRs) of all disks which have partitions in the raid set. <em>mbr</em> is like <em>mbr-only</em> except the boot record on the RAID partition is not suppressed. Use of an explicit list of devices, forces writing of auxiliary boot records only on those devices enumerated, in addition to the boot record on the RAID1 device. Since the version 22 RAID1 codes will never automatically write a boot record on the MBR of device 0x80, if such a boot record is desired, this is one way to have it written. Use of <em>mbr</em> is the other way to force writing to the MBR of device 0x80.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>enables control from a serial line. The specified serial port is initialized and the boot loader is accepting input from it and from the PC's keyboard. Sending a break on the serial line corresponds to pressing a shift key on the console in order to get the boot loader's attention. All boot images should be password-protected if the serial access is less secure than access to the console, e.g. if the line is connected to a modem. The parameter string has the following syntax:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;port&gt;[,&lt;bps&gt;[&lt;parity&gt;[&lt;bits&gt;]]]
</pre>
<p>&lt;port&gt;:  the number of the serial port, zero-based. 0 corresponds to COM1 alias /dev/ttyS0, etc. All four ports can be used (if present).</p><p>&lt;bps&gt;:  the baud rate of the serial port. The following baud rates are supported: 110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400(default), 4800, 9600, plus the extended rates 19200, 38400, and 57600(56000).  115200 is allowed, but may not work with all COMx port hardware.</p><p>&lt;parity&gt;:  the parity used on the serial line. The boot loader ignores input parity and strips the 8th bit. The following (upper or lower case) characters are used to describe the parity:  "n" for no parity, "e" for even parity and "o" for odd parity.</p><p>&lt;bits&gt;:  the number of bits in a character. Only 7 and 8 bits are supported. Default is 8 if parity is "none", 7 if parity is "even" or "odd".</p><p>If `serial' is set, the value of `delay' is automatically raised to 20.</p><p>Example: "serial=0,2400n8" initializes COM1 with the default parameters.</p>

    <p>Causes the operation of the boot installer and boot loader to bypass the use of Volume-ID information, and to revert to a mode of operation of versions of LILO from 22.4 backward.  With Volume-ID booting (22.5 and later), the BIOS codes of disks are determined at boot time, not install time; hence they may be switched around, either by adding or removing disk(s) from the hardware configuration, or by using a BIOS menu to select the boot device.</p><p>With the use of this option, BIOS codes of disks MUST be correctly specified at install time; either guessed correctly by LILO (which often fails on mixed IDE/SCSI systems), or explicitly specified with 'disk=/dev/XXX bios=0xYY' statements.

If the <em>root=</em> parameter is passed from the boot time <strong>boot:</strong> prompt, no quotes are used.  The quotes are only there to satisfy the requirements of the boot-installer parser, which treats an equal sign as an operator.

If one of "boot-as=" or "master-boot" is specified as a global option, it is better to specify "master-boot" as the global option, as it will not interfere with floppy disk BIOS device codes; "boot-as=" is then used as a local option to override "master-boot" as necessary.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>In both the <strong>image=</strong> and <strong>other=</strong> cases, the following options apply.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bypass</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>No password is required to boot this image. Used to indicate that the global password does not apply to this `image=' or `other='.  See 'password=' below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>label=</strong><em>&lt;name&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The boot loader uses the main file name (without its path) of each image specification to identify that image. A different name can be used by setting the variable `label'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>alias=</strong><em>&lt;name&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A second name for the same entry can be used by specifying an alias.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>bmp-retain</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The bitmap graphic (install=bmp) is retained when control is passed to the loaded kernel image, or other= bootloader; i.e., the screen is not blanked to alphanumeric mode before starting the kernel.  This feature is considered EXPERIMENTAL, for those users working with startup splash screens.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>fallback=</strong><em>&lt;command-line&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies a string that is stored as the default command line if the current image is booted. This is useful when experimenting with kernels which may crash before allowing interaction with the system. If using the <strong>fallback</strong> option, the next reboot (e.g. triggered by a manual reset or by a watchdog timer) will load a different (supposedly stable) kernel. The command line stored by the fallback mechanism is cleared by removing or changing the default command line with the <em>-R</em> option, which should be a part of the boot startup scripts.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>lock</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(See above.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>optional</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Omit the image if it is not available at map creation time. It may be specified as a global option. This is useful to specify test kernels that are not always present.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>password=</strong><em>&lt;password&gt;</em></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Protect the `image=' or `other=' with a password (or passphrase). It may be specified as a global option. The interpretation of the `password=' setting is modified by the words `mandatory', `restricted', and `bypass' (see below).</p><p>The password may be specified in the config-file (less secure) or entered at the time the boot loader is installed. To request interactive entry of the password, it should be specified: <strong>password=""</strong>. Passwords entered interactively are not required to be entered again if the boot installer is re-run. They are cached, in hashed form, in a companion file to the config-file, default name: <strong>/etc/lilo.conf.crc</strong>. If the config-file is updated, a warning message will be issued telling you to re-run <em>lilo -p</em> to force re-creation of the password cache file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>mandatory</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A password is required to boot this image. This is the default. May be used on a single `image=' or `other=' to override a different global setting.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>nokbdisable</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(22.7.2) The specified descriptor is not bootable if the IBM-PC keyboard is not present. This option is really only useful if the "serial=" boot terminal is in use. With no keyboard (and no serial terminal) attached, selecting a boot descriptor other than the default is impossible. See <em>nokbdefault</em> above.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>restricted</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A password is only required to boot the image if kernel parameters are specified on the command line (e.g. 'single').  May be used on a single `image=' or `other=' to override a different global setting.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>vmwarn</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If booting under a virtual monitor such as VMware(tm), the image with this label will cause a cautionary warning to be issued at boot time, and user intervention will be required to continue or to abort the boot process.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>vmdisable</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If booting under a virtual monitor, the image with this label will not be displayed as a boot option.  The image is only bootable in real mode.  See <em>vmdefault</em> above.</p>
  </dd>
