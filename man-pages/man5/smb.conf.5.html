        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">SYNOPSIS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The smb.conf file is a configuration file for the Samba suite. smb.conf contains runtime configuration information for the Samba programs. The complete description of the file format and possible parameters held within are here for reference purposes.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">FILE FORMAT</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The file consists of sections and parameters. A section begins with the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section begins. Sections contain parameters of the form:</p>
<pre>
<em>name</em> = <em>value </em>
</pre>
<p>The file is line-based - that is, each newline-terminated line represents either a comment, a section name or a parameter.</p><p>Section and parameter names are not case sensitive.</p><p>Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant. Whitespace before or after the first equals sign is discarded. Leading, trailing and internal whitespace in section and parameter names is irrelevant. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter value is discarded. Internal whitespace within a parameter value is retained verbatim.</p><p>Any line beginning with a semicolon (&ldquo;;&rdquo;) or a hash (&ldquo;#&rdquo;) character is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace.</p><p>Any line ending in a &ldquo;&#92;&rdquo; is continued on the next line in the customary UNIX fashion.</p><p>The values following the equals sign in parameters are all either a string (no quotes needed) or a boolean, which may be given as yes/no, 1/0 or true/false. Case is not significant in boolean values, but is preserved in string values. Some items such as create masks are numeric.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">SECTION DESCRIPTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Each section in the configuration file (except for the [global] section) describes a shared resource (known as a &ldquo;share&rdquo;). The section name is the name of the shared resource and the parameters within the section define the shares attributes.</p><p>There are three special sections, [global], [homes] and [printers], which are described under <em>special sections</em>. The following notes apply to ordinary section descriptions.</p><p>A share consists of a directory to which access is being given plus a description of the access rights which are granted to the user of the service. Some housekeeping options are also specifiable.</p><p>Sections are either file share services (used by the client as an extension of their native file systems) or printable services (used by the client to access print services on the host running the server).</p><p>Sections may be designated <em>guest</em> services, in which case no password is required to access them. A specified UNIX <em>guest account</em> is used to define access privileges in this case.</p><p>Sections other than guest services will require a password to access them. The client provides the username. As older clients only provide passwords and not usernames, you may specify a list of usernames to check against the password using the user = option in the share definition. For modern clients such as Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000, this should not be necessary.</p><p>The access rights granted by the server are masked by the access rights granted to the specified or guest UNIX user by the host system. The server does not grant more access than the host system grants.</p><p>The following sample section defines a file space share. The user has write access to the path /home/bar. The share is accessed via the share name foo:</p>
<pre>
	<em>[foo]</em>
	\m[blue]<strong>path = /home/bar</strong>\m[]
	\m[blue]<strong>read only = no</strong>\m[]
</pre>
<p>The following sample section defines a printable share. The share is read-only, but printable. That is, the only write access permitted is via calls to open, write to and close a spool file. The <em>guest ok</em> parameter means access will be permitted as the default guest user (specified elsewhere):</p>
<pre>
	<em>[aprinter]</em>
	\m[blue]<strong>path = /usr/spool/public</strong>\m[]
	\m[blue]<strong>read only = yes</strong>\m[]
	\m[blue]<strong>printable = yes</strong>\m[]
	\m[blue]<strong>guest ok = yes</strong>\m[]
</pre>

        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">SPECIAL SECTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<h3>The [global] section</h3>
<p>Parameters in this section apply to the server as a whole, or are defaults for sections that do not specifically define certain items. See the notes under PARAMETERS for more information.</p>
<h3>The [homes] section</h3>
<p>If a section called [homes] is included in the configuration file, services connecting clients to their home directories can be created on the fly by the server.</p><p>When the connection request is made, the existing sections are scanned. If a match is found, it is used. If no match is found, the requested section name is treated as a username and looked up in the local password file. If the name exists and the correct password has been given, a share is created by cloning the [homes] section.</p><p>Some modifications are then made to the newly created share:</p><p>The share name is changed from homes to the located username.</p><p>If no path was given, the path is set to the user&apos;s home directory.</p><p>If you decide to use a <em>path =</em> line in your [homes] section, it may be useful to use the %S macro. For example:</p>
<pre>
<strong>path = /data/pchome/%S</strong>
</pre>
<p>is useful if you have different home directories for your PCs than for UNIX access.</p><p>This is a fast and simple way to give a large number of clients access to their home directories with a minimum of fuss.</p><p>A similar process occurs if the requested section name is &ldquo;homes&rdquo;, except that the share name is not changed to that of the requesting user. This method of using the [homes] section works well if different users share a client PC.</p><p>The [homes] section can specify all the parameters a normal service section can specify, though some make more sense than others. The following is a typical and suitable [homes] section:</p>
<pre>
<em>[homes]</em>
\m[blue]<strong>read only = no</strong>\m[]
</pre>
<p>An important point is that if guest access is specified in the [homes] section, all home directories will be visible to all clients <em>without a password</em>. In the very unlikely event that this is actually desirable, it is wise to also specify <em>read only access</em>.</p><p>The <em>browseable</em> flag for auto home directories will be inherited from the global browseable flag, not the [homes] browseable flag. This is useful as it means setting <em>browseable = no</em> in the [homes] section will hide the [homes] share but make any auto home directories visible.</p>
<h3>The [printers] section</h3>
<p>This section works like [homes], but for printers.</p><p>If a [printers] section occurs in the configuration file, users are able to connect to any printer specified in the local host&apos;s printcap file.</p><p>When a connection request is made, the existing sections are scanned. If a match is found, it is used. If no match is found, but a [homes] section exists, it is used as described above. Otherwise, the requested section name is treated as a printer name and the appropriate printcap file is scanned to see if the requested section name is a valid printer share name. If a match is found, a new printer share is created by cloning the [printers] section.</p><p>A few modifications are then made to the newly created share:</p><p>The share name is set to the located printer name</p><p>If no printer name was given, the printer name is set to the located printer name</p><p>If the share does not permit guest access and no username was given, the username is set to the located printer name.</p><p>The [printers] service MUST be printable - if you specify otherwise, the server will refuse to load the configuration file.</p><p>Typically the path specified is that of a world-writeable spool directory with the sticky bit set on it. A typical [printers] entry looks like this:</p>
<pre>
<em>[printers]</em>
\m[blue]<strong>path = /usr/spool/public</strong>\m[]
\m[blue]<strong>guest ok = yes</strong>\m[]
\m[blue]<strong>printable = yes</strong>\m[]
</pre>
<p>All aliases given for a printer in the printcap file are legitimate printer names as far as the server is concerned. If your printing subsystem doesn&apos;t work like that, you will have to set up a pseudo-printcap. This is a file consisting of one or more lines like this:</p>
<pre>
alias|alias|alias|alias...
</pre>
<p>Each alias should be an acceptable printer name for your printing subsystem. In the [global] section, specify the new file as your printcap. The server will only recognize names found in your pseudo-printcap, which of course can contain whatever aliases you like. The same technique could be used simply to limit access to a subset of your local printers.</p><p>An alias, by the way, is defined as any component of the first entry of a printcap record. Records are separated by newlines, components (if there are more than one) are separated by vertical bar symbols (|).</p><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>On SYSV systems which use lpstat to determine what printers are defined on the system you may be able to use printcap name = lpstat to automatically obtain a list of printers. See the printcap name option for more details.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">USERSHARES</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Starting with Samba version 3.0.23 the capability for non-root users to add, modify, and delete their own share definitions has been added. This capability is called <em>usershares</em> and is controlled by a set of parameters in the [global] section of the smb.conf. The relevant parameters are :</p><p>usershare allow guests</p><p>Controls if usershares can permit guest access.</p><p>usershare max shares</p><p>Maximum number of user defined shares allowed.</p><p>usershare owner only</p><p>If set only directories owned by the sharing user can be shared.</p><p>usershare path</p><p>Points to the directory containing the user defined share definitions. The filesystem permissions on this directory control who can create user defined shares.</p><p>usershare prefix allow list</p><p>Comma-separated list of absolute pathnames restricting what directories can be shared. Only directories below the pathnames in this list are permitted.</p><p>usershare prefix deny list</p><p>Comma-separated list of absolute pathnames restricting what directories can be shared. Directories below the pathnames in this list are prohibited.</p><p>usershare template share</p><p>Names a pre-existing share used as a template for creating new usershares. All other share parameters not specified in the user defined share definition are copied from this named share.</p><p>To allow members of the UNIX group foo to create user defined shares, create the directory to contain the share definitions as follows:</p><p>Become root:</p>
<pre>
mkdir /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares
chgrp foo /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares
chmod 1770 /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares
</pre>
<p>Then add the parameters</p>
<pre>
	\m[blue]<strong>usershare path = /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares</strong>\m[]
	\m[blue]<strong>usershare max shares = 10</strong>\m[] # (or the desired number of shares)
</pre>
<p>to the global section of your smb.conf. Members of the group foo may then manipulate the user defined shares using the following commands.</p><p>net usershare add sharename path [comment] [acl] [guest_ok=[y|n]]</p><p>To create or modify (overwrite) a user defined share.</p><p>net usershare delete sharename</p><p>To delete a user defined share.</p><p>net usershare list wildcard-sharename</p><p>To list user defined shares.</p><p>net usershare info wildcard-sharename</p><p>To print information about user defined shares.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">PARAMETERS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Parameters define the specific attributes of sections.</p><p>Some parameters are specific to the [global] section (e.g., <em>security</em>). Some parameters are usable in all sections (e.g., <em>create mask</em>). All others are permissible only in normal sections. For the purposes of the following descriptions the [homes] and [printers] sections will be considered normal. The letter <em>G</em> in parentheses indicates that a parameter is specific to the [global] section. The letter <em>S</em> indicates that a parameter can be specified in a service specific section. All <em>S</em> parameters can also be specified in the [global] section - in which case they will define the default behavior for all services.</p><p>Parameters are arranged here in alphabetical order - this may not create best bedfellows, but at least you can find them! Where there are synonyms, the preferred synonym is described, others refer to the preferred synonym.</p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">VARIABLE SUBSTITUTIONS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Many of the strings that are settable in the config file can take substitutions. For example the option &ldquo;path = /tmp/%u&rdquo; is interpreted as &ldquo;path = /tmp/john&rdquo; if the user connected with the username john.</p><p>These substitutions are mostly noted in the descriptions below, but there are some general substitutions which apply whenever they might be relevant. These are:</p><p>%U</p><p>session username (the username that the client wanted, not necessarily the same as the one they got).</p><p>%G</p><p>primary group name of %U.</p><p>%h</p><p>the Internet hostname that Samba is running on.</p><p>%m</p><p>the NetBIOS name of the client machine (very useful).</p><p>This parameter is not available when Samba listens on port 445, as clients no longer send this information. If you use this macro in an include statement on a domain that has a Samba domain controller be sure to set in the [global] section <em>smb ports = 139</em>. This will cause Samba to not listen on port 445 and will permit include functionality to function as it did with Samba 2.x.</p><p>%L</p><p>the NetBIOS name of the server. This allows you to change your config based on what the client calls you. Your server can have a &ldquo;dual personality&rdquo;.</p><p>%M</p><p>the Internet name of the client machine.</p><p>%R</p><p>the selected protocol level after protocol negotiation. It can be one of CORE, COREPLUS, LANMAN1, LANMAN2, NT1, SMB2_02, SMB2_10, SMB2_22, SMB2_24, SMB3_00 or SMB2_FF.</p><p>%d</p><p>the process id of the current server process.</p><p>%a</p><p>The architecture of the remote machine. It currently recognizes Samba (<strong>Samba</strong>), the Linux CIFS file system (<strong>CIFSFS</strong>), OS/2, (<strong>OS2</strong>), Mac OS X (<strong>OSX</strong>), Windows for Workgroups (<strong>WfWg</strong>), Windows 9x/ME (<strong>Win95</strong>), Windows NT (<strong>WinNT</strong>), Windows 2000 (<strong>Win2K</strong>), Windows XP (<strong>WinXP</strong>), Windows XP 64-bit(<strong>WinXP64</strong>), Windows 2003 including 2003R2 (<strong>Win2K3</strong>), and Windows Vista (<strong>Vista</strong>). Anything else will be known as <strong>UNKNOWN</strong>.</p><p>%I</p><p>the IP address of the client machine.</p><p>Before 4.0.0 it could contain IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses, now it only contains IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.</p><p>%i</p><p>the local IP address to which a client connected.</p><p>Before 4.0.0 it could contain IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses, now it only contains IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.</p><p>%T</p><p>the current date and time.</p><p>%D</p><p>name of the domain or workgroup of the current user.</p><p>%w</p><p>the winbind separator.</p><p>%$(<em>envvar</em>)</p><p>the value of the environment variable <em>envar</em>.</p><p>The following substitutes apply only to some configuration options (only those that are used when a connection has been established):</p><p>%S</p><p>the name of the current service, if any.</p><p>%P</p><p>the root directory of the current service, if any.</p><p>%u</p><p>username of the current service, if any.</p><p>%g</p><p>primary group name of %u.</p><p>%H</p><p>the home directory of the user given by %u.</p><p>%N</p><p>the name of your NIS home directory server. This is obtained from your NIS auto.map entry. If you have not compiled Samba with the <em>--with-automount</em> option, this value will be the same as %L.</p><p>%p</p><p>the path of the service&apos;s home directory, obtained from your NIS auto.map entry. The NIS auto.map entry is split up as %N:%p.</p><p>There are some quite creative things that can be done with these substitutions and other smb.conf options.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">NAME MANGLING</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Samba supports name mangling so that DOS and Windows clients can use files that don&apos;t conform to the 8.3 format. It can also be set to adjust the case of 8.3 format filenames.</p><p>There are several options that control the way mangling is performed, and they are grouped here rather than listed separately. For the defaults look at the output of the testparm program.</p><p>These options can be set separately for each service.</p><p>The options are:</p><p>case sensitive = yes/no/auto</p><p>controls whether filenames are case sensitive. If they aren&apos;t, Samba must do a filename search and match on passed names. The default setting of auto allows clients that support case sensitive filenames (Linux CIFSVFS and smbclient 3.0.5 and above currently) to tell the Samba server on a per-packet basis that they wish to access the file system in a case-sensitive manner (to support UNIX case sensitive semantics). No Windows or DOS system supports case-sensitive filename so setting this option to auto is that same as setting it to no for them. Default <em>auto</em>.</p><p>default case = upper/lower</p><p>controls what the default case is for new filenames (ie. files that don&apos;t currently exist in the filesystem). Default <em>lower</em>. IMPORTANT NOTE: As part of the optimizations for directories containing large numbers of files, the following special case applies. If the options \m[blue]<strong>case sensitive = yes</strong>\m[], \m[blue]<strong>preserve case = No</strong>\m[], and \m[blue]<strong>short preserve case = No</strong>\m[] are set, then the case of <em>all</em> incoming client filenames, not just new filenames, will be modified. See additional notes below.</p><p>preserve case = yes/no</p><p>controls whether new files (ie. files that don&apos;t currently exist in the filesystem) are created with the case that the client passes, or if they are forced to be the default case. Default <em>yes</em>.</p><p>short preserve case = yes/no</p><p>controls if new files (ie. files that don&apos;t currently exist in the filesystem) which conform to 8.3 syntax, that is all in upper case and of suitable length, are created upper case, or if they are forced to be the default case. This option can be used with preserve case = yes to permit long filenames to retain their case, while short names are lowercased. Default <em>yes</em>.</p><p>By default, Samba 3.0 has the same semantics as a Windows NT server, in that it is case insensitive but case preserving. As a special case for directories with large numbers of files, if the case options are set as follows, "case sensitive = yes", "case preserve = no", "short preserve case = no" then the "default case" option will be applied and will modify all filenames sent from the client when accessing this share.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">REGISTRY-BASED CONFIGURATION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Starting with Samba version 3.2.0, the capability to store Samba configuration in the registry is available. The configuration is stored in the registry key <em>HKLM&#92;Software&#92;Samba&#92;smbconf</em>. There are two levels of registry configuration:</p><p>Share definitions stored in registry are used. This is triggered by setting the global parameter <em>registry shares</em> to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in <em>smb.conf</em>.</p><p>The registry shares are loaded not at startup but on demand at runtime by <em>smbd</em>. Shares defined in <em>smb.conf</em> take priority over shares of the same name defined in registry.</p><p>Global <em>smb.conf</em> options stored in registry are used. This can be activated in two different ways:</p><p>Firstly, a registry only configuration is triggered by setting \m[blue]<strong>config backend = registry</strong>\m[] in the [global] section of <em>smb.conf</em>. This resets everything that has been read from config files to this point and reads the content of the global configuration section from the registry. This is the recommended method of using registry based configuration.</p><p>Secondly, a mixed configuration can be activated by a special new meaning of the parameter \m[blue]<strong>include = registry</strong>\m[] in the [global] section of <em>smb.conf</em>. This reads the global options from registry with the same priorities as for an include of a text file. This may be especially useful in cases where an initial configuration is needed to access the registry.</p><p>Activation of global registry options automatically activates registry shares. So in the registry only case, shares are loaded on demand only.</p><p>Note: To make registry-based configurations foolproof at least to a certain extent, the use of <em>lock directory</em> and <em>config backend</em> inside the registry configuration has been disabled: Especially by changing the <em>lock directory</em> inside the registry configuration, one would create a broken setup where the daemons do not see the configuration they loaded once it is active.</p><p>The registry configuration can be accessed with tools like <em>regedit</em> or <em>net (rpc) registry</em> in the key <em>HKLM&#92;Software&#92;Samba&#92;smbconf</em>. More conveniently, the <em>conf</em> subcommand of the <a href="../man8/net.8.html"><strong>net</strong>(8)</a> utility offers a dedicated interface to read and write the registry based configuration locally, i.e. directly accessing the database file, circumventing the server.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>abort shutdown script (G)</p><p>This a full path name to a script called by <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> that should stop a shutdown procedure issued by the \m[blue]<strong>shutdown script</strong>\m[].</p><p>If the connected user possesses the <strong>SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege</strong>, right, this command will be run as root.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>abort shutdown script</em><em> = </em><em>""</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>abort shutdown script</em><em> = </em><em>/sbin/shutdown -c</em><em> </em></p><p>access based share enum (S)</p><p>If this parameter is <strong>yes</strong> for a service, then the share hosted by the service will only be visible to users who have read or write access to the share during share enumeration (for example net view &#92;&#92;sambaserver). This has parallels to access based enumeration, the main difference being that only share permissions are evaluated, and security descriptors on files contained on the share are not used in computing enumeration access rights.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>access based share enum</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>acl allow execute always (S)</p><p>This boolean parameter controls the behaviour of <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> when receiving a protocol request of "open for execution" from a Windows client. With Samba 3.6 and older, the execution right in the ACL was not checked, so a client could execute a file even if it did not have execute rights on the file. In Samba 4.0, this has been fixed, so that by default, i.e. when this parameter is set to "False", "open for execution" is now denied when execution permissions are not present.</p><p>If this parameter is set to "True", Samba does not check execute permissions on "open for execution", thus re-establishing the behaviour of Samba 3.6. This can be useful to smoothen upgrades from older Samba versions to 4.0 and newer. This setting is not meant to be used as a permanent setting, but as a temporary relief: It is recommended to fix the permissions in the ACLs and reset this parameter to the default after a certain transition period.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>acl allow execute always</em><em> = </em><em>False</em><em> </em></p><p>acl check permissions (S)</p><p>Please note this parameter is now deprecated in Samba 3.6.2 and will be removed in a future version of Samba.</p><p>This boolean parameter controls what <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a>does on receiving a protocol request of "open for delete" from a Windows client. If a Windows client doesn&apos;t have permissions to delete a file then they expect this to be denied at open time. POSIX systems normally only detect restrictions on delete by actually attempting to delete the file or directory. As Windows clients can (and do) "back out" a delete request by unsetting the "delete on close" bit Samba cannot delete the file immediately on "open for delete" request as we cannot restore such a deleted file. With this parameter set to true (the default) then smbd checks the file system permissions directly on "open for delete" and denies the request without actually deleting the file if the file system permissions would seem to deny it. This is not perfect, as it&apos;s possible a user could have deleted a file without Samba being able to check the permissions correctly, but it is close enough to Windows semantics for mostly correct behaviour. Samba will correctly check POSIX ACL semantics in this case.</p><p>If this parameter is set to "false" Samba doesn&apos;t check permissions on "open for delete" and allows the open. If the user doesn&apos;t have permission to delete the file this will only be discovered at close time, which is too late for the Windows user tools to display an error message to the user. The symptom of this is files that appear to have been deleted "magically" re-appearing on a Windows explorer refresh. This is an extremely advanced protocol option which should not need to be changed. This parameter was introduced in its final form in 3.0.21, an earlier version with slightly different semantics was introduced in 3.0.20. That older version is not documented here.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>acl check permissions</em><em> = </em><em>True</em><em> </em></p><p>acl group control (S)</p><p>In a POSIX filesystem, only the owner of a file or directory and the superuser can modify the permissions and ACLs on a file. If this parameter is set, then Samba overrides this restriction, and also allows the <em>primary group owner</em> of a file or directory to modify the permissions and ACLs on that file.</p><p>On a Windows server, groups may be the owner of a file or directory - thus allowing anyone in that group to modify the permissions on it. This allows the delegation of security controls on a point in the filesystem to the group owner of a directory and anything below it also owned by that group. This means there are multiple people with permissions to modify ACLs on a file or directory, easing manageability.</p><p>This parameter allows Samba to also permit delegation of the control over a point in the exported directory hierarchy in much the same way as Windows. This allows all members of a UNIX group to control the permissions on a file or directory they have group ownership on.</p><p>This parameter is best used with the \m[blue]<strong>inherit owner</strong>\m[] option and also on a share containing directories with the UNIX <em>setgid bit</em> set on them, which causes new files and directories created within it to inherit the group ownership from the containing directory.</p><p>This is parameter has been was deprecated in Samba 3.0.23, but re-activated in Samba 3.0.31 and above, as it now only controls permission changes if the user is in the owning primary group. It is now no longer equivalent to the <em>dos filemode</em> option.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>acl group control</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>acl map full control (S)</p><p>This boolean parameter controls whether <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> maps a POSIX ACE entry of "rwx" (read/write/execute), the maximum allowed POSIX permission set, into a Windows ACL of "FULL CONTROL". If this parameter is set to true any POSIX ACE entry of "rwx" will be returned in a Windows ACL as "FULL CONTROL", is this parameter is set to false any POSIX ACE entry of "rwx" will be returned as the specific Windows ACL bits representing read, write and execute.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>acl map full control</em><em> = </em><em>True</em><em> </em></p><p>add group script (G)</p><p>This is the full pathname to a script that will be run <em>AS ROOT</em> by <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> when a new group is requested. It will expand any <em>%g</em> to the group name passed. This script is only useful for installations using the Windows NT domain administration tools. The script is free to create a group with an arbitrary name to circumvent unix group name restrictions. In that case the script must print the numeric gid of the created group on stdout.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>add group script</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>add group script</em><em> = </em><em>/usr/sbin/groupadd %g</em><em> </em></p><p>add machine script (G)</p><p>This is the full pathname to a script that will be run by <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> when a machine is added to Samba&apos;s domain and a Unix account matching the machine&apos;s name appended with a "$" does not already exist.</p><p>This option is very similar to the \m[blue]<strong>add user script</strong>\m[], and likewise uses the %u substitution for the account name. Do not use the %m substitution.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>add machine script</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>add machine script</em><em> = </em><em>/usr/sbin/adduser -n -g machines -c Machine -d /var/lib/nobody -s /bin/false %u</em><em> </em></p><p>addport command (G)</p><p>Samba 3.0.23 introduced support for adding printer ports remotely using the Windows "Add Standard TCP/IP Port Wizard". This option defines an external program to be executed when smbd receives a request to add a new Port to the system. The script is passed two parameters:</p><p><em>port name</em></p><p><em>device URI</em></p><p>The deviceURI is in the format of socket://&lt;hostname&gt;[:&lt;portnumber&gt;] or lpd://&lt;hostname&gt;/&lt;queuename&gt;.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>addport command</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>addport command</em><em> = </em><em>/etc/samba/scripts/addport.sh</em><em> </em></p><p>addprinter command (G)</p><p>With the introduction of MS-RPC based printing support for Windows NT/2000 clients in Samba 2.2, The MS Add Printer Wizard (APW) icon is now also available in the "Printers..." folder displayed a share listing. The APW allows for printers to be add remotely to a Samba or Windows NT/2000 print server.</p><p>For a Samba host this means that the printer must be physically added to the underlying printing system. The <em>addprinter command</em> defines a script to be run which will perform the necessary operations for adding the printer to the print system and to add the appropriate service definition to the smb.conf file in order that it can be shared by <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a>.</p><p>The <em>addprinter command</em> is automatically invoked with the following parameter (in order):</p><p><em>printer name</em></p><p><em>share name</em></p><p><em>port name</em></p><p><em>driver name</em></p><p><em>location</em></p><p><em>Windows 9x driver location</em></p><p>All parameters are filled in from the PRINTER_INFO_2 structure sent by the Windows NT/2000 client with one exception. The "Windows 9x driver location" parameter is included for backwards compatibility only. The remaining fields in the structure are generated from answers to the APW questions.</p><p>Once the <em>addprinter command</em> has been executed, smbd will reparse the smb.conf to determine if the share defined by the APW exists. If the sharename is still invalid, then smbd will return an ACCESS_DENIED error to the client.</p><p>The <em>addprinter command</em> program can output a single line of text, which Samba will set as the port the new printer is connected to. If this line isn&apos;t output, Samba won&apos;t reload its printer shares.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>addprinter command</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>addprinter command</em><em> = </em><em>/usr/bin/addprinter</em><em> </em></p><p>add share command (G)</p><p>Samba 2.2.0 introduced the ability to dynamically add and delete shares via the Windows NT 4.0 Server Manager. The <em>add share command</em> is used to define an external program or script which will add a new service definition to smb.conf.</p><p>In order to successfully execute the <em>add share command</em>, smbd requires that the administrator connects using a root account (i.e. uid == 0) or has the SeDiskOperatorPrivilege. Scripts defined in the <em>add share command</em> parameter are executed as root.</p><p>When executed, smbd will automatically invoke the <em>add share command</em> with five parameters.</p><p><em>configFile</em> - the location of the global smb.conf file.</p><p><em>shareName</em> - the name of the new share.</p><p><em>pathName</em> - path to an **existing** directory on disk.</p><p><em>comment</em> - comment string to associate with the new share.</p><p><em>max connections</em> Number of maximum simultaneous connections to this share.</p><p>This parameter is only used to add file shares. To add printer shares, see the \m[blue]<strong>addprinter command</strong>\m[].</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>add share command</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>add share command</em><em> = </em><em>/usr/local/bin/addshare</em><em> </em></p><p>add user script (G)</p><p>This is the full pathname to a script that will be run <em>AS ROOT</em> by <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> under special circumstances described below.</p><p>Normally, a Samba server requires that UNIX users are created for all users accessing files on this server. For sites that use Windows NT account databases as their primary user database creating these users and keeping the user list in sync with the Windows NT PDC is an onerous task. This option allows smbd to create the required UNIX users <em>ON DEMAND</em> when a user accesses the Samba server.</p><p>When the Windows user attempts to access the Samba server, at login (session setup in the SMB protocol) time, <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> contacts the \m[blue]<strong>password server</strong>\m[] and attempts to authenticate the given user with the given password. If the authentication succeeds then smbd attempts to find a UNIX user in the UNIX password database to map the Windows user into. If this lookup fails, and \m[blue]<strong>add user script</strong>\m[] is set then smbd will call the specified script <em>AS ROOT</em>, expanding any <em>%u</em> argument to be the user name to create.</p><p>If this script successfully creates the user then smbd will continue on as though the UNIX user already existed. In this way, UNIX users are dynamically created to match existing Windows NT accounts.</p><p>See also \m[blue]<strong>security</strong>\m[], \m[blue]<strong>password server</strong>\m[], \m[blue]<strong>delete user script</strong>\m[].</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>add user script</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>add user script</em><em> = </em><em>/usr/local/samba/bin/add_user %u</em><em> </em></p><p>add user to group script (G)</p><p>Full path to the script that will be called when a user is added to a group using the Windows NT domain administration tools.

The Administrative Shares are the default network shares created by all Windows NT-based operating systems. These are shares like C$, D$ or ADMIN$. The type of these shares is STYPE_DISKTREE_HIDDEN.</p><p>See the section below on \m[blue]<strong>security</strong>\m[] for more information about this option.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>administrative share</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>admin users (S)</p><p>This is a list of users who will be granted administrative privileges on the share. This means that they will do all file operations as the super-user (root).</p><p>You should use this option very carefully, as any user in this list will be able to do anything they like on the share, irrespective of file permissions.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>admin users</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>admin users</em><em> = </em><em>jason</em><em> </em></p><p>afs share (S)</p><p>This parameter controls whether special AFS features are enabled for this share. If enabled, it assumes that the directory exported via the <em>path</em> parameter is a local AFS import. The special AFS features include the attempt to hand-craft an AFS token if you enabled --with-fake-kaserver in configure.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>afs share</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>afs token lifetime (G)</p><p>This parameter controls the lifetime of tokens that the AFS fake-kaserver claims. In reality these never expire but this lifetime controls when the afs client will forget the token.</p><p>Set this parameter to 0 to get <strong>NEVERDATE</strong>.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>afs token lifetime</em><em> = </em><em>604800</em><em> </em></p><p>afs username map (G)</p><p>If you are using the fake kaserver AFS feature, you might want to hand-craft the usernames you are creating tokens for. For example this is necessary if you have users from several domain in your AFS Protection Database. One possible scheme to code users as DOMAIN+User as it is done by winbind with the + as a separator.</p><p>The mapped user name must contain the cell name to log into, so without setting this parameter there will be no token.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>afs username map</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>afs username map</em><em> = </em><em>%u@afs.samba.org</em><em> </em></p><p>aio read size (S)</p><p>If Samba has been built with asynchronous I/O support and this integer parameter is set to non-zero value, Samba will read from file asynchronously when size of request is bigger than this value. Note that it happens only for non-chained and non-chaining reads and when not using write cache.</p><p>Current implementation of asynchronous I/O in Samba 3.0 does support only up to 10 outstanding asynchronous requests, read and write combined.</p><p>Related command: \m[blue]<strong>write cache size</strong>\m[]</p><p>Related command: \m[blue]<strong>aio write size</strong>\m[]</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>aio read size</em><em> = </em><em>0</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>aio read size</em><em> = </em><em>16384 # Use asynchronous I/O for reads bigger than 16KB request size</em><em> </em></p><p>aio write behind (S)</p><p>If Samba has been built with asynchronous I/O support, Samba will not wait until write requests are finished before returning the result to the client for files listed in this parameter. Instead, Samba will immediately return that the write request has been finished successfully, no matter if the operation will succeed or not. This might speed up clients without aio support, but is really dangerous, because data could be lost and files could be damaged.</p><p>The syntax is identical to the \m[blue]<strong>veto files</strong>\m[] parameter.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>aio write behind</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>aio write behind</em><em> = </em><em>/*.tmp/</em><em> </em></p><p>aio write size (S)</p><p>If Samba has been built with asynchronous I/O support and this integer parameter is set to non-zero value, Samba will write to file asynchronously when size of request is bigger than this value.

As such the algorithmic mapping can&apos;t be &apos;turned off&apos;, but pushing it &apos;out of the way&apos; should resolve the issues. Users and groups can then be assigned &apos;low&apos; RIDs in arbitrary-rid supporting backends.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>algorithmic rid base</em><em> = </em><em>1000</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>algorithmic rid base</em><em> = </em><em>100000</em><em> </em></p><p>allocation roundup size (S)</p><p>This parameter allows an administrator to tune the allocation size reported to Windows clients. The default size of 1Mb generally results in improved Windows client performance. However, rounding the allocation size may cause difficulties for some applications, e.g. MS Visual Studio. If the MS Visual Studio compiler starts to crash with an internal error, set this parameter to zero for this share.</p><p>The integer parameter specifies the roundup size in bytes.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>allocation roundup size</em><em> = </em><em>1048576</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>allocation roundup size</em><em> = </em><em>0 # (to disable roundups)</em><em> </em></p><p>allow dns updates (G)</p><p>This option determines what kind of updates to the DNS are allowed.</p><p>DNS updates can either be disallowed completely by setting it to <strong>disabled</strong>, enabled over secure connections only by setting it to <strong>secure only</strong> or allowed in all cases by setting it to <strong>nonsecure</strong>.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>allow dns updates</em><em> = </em><em>secure only</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>allow dns updates</em><em> = </em><em>disabled</em><em> </em></p><p>allow insecure wide links (G)</p><p>In normal operation the option \m[blue]<strong>wide links</strong>\m[] which allows the server to follow symlinks outside of a share path is automatically disabled when \m[blue]<strong>unix extensions</strong>\m[] are enabled on a Samba server. This is done for security purposes to prevent UNIX clients creating symlinks to areas of the server file system that the administrator does not wish to export.</p><p>Setting \m[blue]<strong>allow insecure wide links</strong>\m[] to true disables the link between these two parameters, removing this protection and allowing a site to configure the server to follow symlinks (by setting \m[blue]<strong>wide links</strong>\m[] to "true") even when \m[blue]<strong>unix extensions</strong>\m[] is turned on.</p><p>If is not recommended to enable this option unless you fully understand the implications of allowing the server to follow symbolic links created by UNIX clients. For most normal Samba configurations this would be considered a security hole and setting this parameter is not recommended.</p><p>This option was added at the request of sites who had deliberately set Samba up in this way and needed to continue supporting this functionality without having to patch the Samba code.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>allow insecure wide links</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>allow trusted domains (G)</p><p>This option only takes effect when the \m[blue]<strong>security</strong>\m[] option is set to <strong>server</strong>, <strong>domain</strong> or <strong>ads</strong>. If it is set to no, then attempts to connect to a resource from a domain or workgroup other than the one which smbd is running in will fail, even if that domain is trusted by the remote server doing the authentication.</p><p>This is useful if you only want your Samba server to serve resources to users in the domain it is a member of. As an example, suppose that there are two domains DOMA and DOMB. DOMB is trusted by DOMA, which contains the Samba server. Under normal circumstances, a user with an account in DOMB can then access the resources of a UNIX account with the same account name on the Samba server even if they do not have an account in DOMA. This can make implementing a security boundary difficult.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>allow trusted domains</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>async smb echo handler (G)</p><p>This parameter specifies whether Samba should fork the async smb echo handler. It can be beneficial if your file system can block syscalls for a very long time. In some circumstances, it prolongs the timeout that Windows uses to determine whether a connection is dead.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>async smb echo handler</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>auth methods (G)</p><p>This option allows the administrator to chose what authentication methods smbd will use when authenticating a user. This option defaults to sensible values based on \m[blue]<strong>security</strong>\m[]. This should be considered a developer option and used only in rare circumstances. In the majority (if not all) of production servers, the default setting should be adequate.</p><p>Each entry in the list attempts to authenticate the user in turn, until the user authenticates. In practice only one method will ever actually be able to complete the authentication.</p><p>Possible options include <strong>guest</strong> (anonymous access), <strong>sam</strong> (lookups in local list of accounts based on netbios name or domain name), <strong>winbind</strong> (relay authentication requests for remote users through winbindd), <strong>ntdomain</strong> (pre-winbindd method of authentication for remote domain users; deprecated in favour of winbind method), <strong>trustdomain</strong> (authenticate trusted users by contacting the remote DC directly from smbd; deprecated in favour of winbind method).</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>auth methods</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>auth methods</em><em> = </em><em>guest sam winbind</em><em> </em></p><p>available (S)</p><p>This parameter lets you "turn off" a service. If <em>available = no</em>, then <em>ALL</em> attempts to connect to the service will fail. Such failures are logged.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>available</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>bind interfaces only (G)</p><p>This global parameter allows the Samba admin to limit what interfaces on a machine will serve SMB requests. It affects file service <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> and name service <a href="../man8/nmbd.8.html"><strong>nmbd</strong>(8)</a> in a slightly different ways.</p><p>For name service it causes nmbd to bind to ports 137 and 138 on the interfaces listed in the \m[blue]<strong>interfaces</strong>\m[] parameter. nmbd also binds to the "all addresses" interface (0.0.0.0) on ports 137 and 138 for the purposes of reading broadcast messages. If this option is not set then nmbd will service name requests on all of these sockets. If \m[blue]<strong>bind interfaces only</strong>\m[] is set then nmbd will check the source address of any packets coming in on the broadcast sockets and discard any that don&apos;t match the broadcast addresses of the interfaces in the \m[blue]<strong>interfaces</strong>\m[] parameter list. As unicast packets are received on the other sockets it allows nmbd to refuse to serve names to machines that send packets that arrive through any interfaces not listed in the \m[blue]<strong>interfaces</strong>\m[] list. IP Source address spoofing does defeat this simple check, however, so it must not be used seriously as a security feature for nmbd.</p><p>For file service it causes <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> to bind only to the interface list given in the \m[blue]<strong>interfaces</strong>\m[] parameter. This restricts the networks that smbd will serve, to packets coming in on those interfaces. Note that you should not use this parameter for machines that are serving PPP or other intermittent or non-broadcast network interfaces as it will not cope with non-permanent interfaces.</p><p>If \m[blue]<strong>bind interfaces only</strong>\m[] is set and the network address <em>127.0.0.1</em> is not added to the \m[blue]<strong>interfaces</strong>\m[] parameter list <a href="../man8/smbpasswd.8.html"><strong>smbpasswd</strong>(8)</a> may not work as expected due to the reasons covered below.</p><p>To change a users SMB password, the smbpasswd by default connects to the <em>localhost - 127.0.0.1</em> address as an SMB client to issue the password change request. If \m[blue]<strong>bind interfaces only</strong>\m[] is set then unless the network address <em>127.0.0.1</em> is added to the \m[blue]<strong>interfaces</strong>\m[] parameter list then smbpasswd will fail to connect in it&apos;s default mode. smbpasswd can be forced to use the primary IP interface of the local host by using its <a href="../man8/smbpasswd.8.html"><strong>smbpasswd</strong>(8)</a><em>-r </em><em></em><em>remote machine</em> parameter, with <em>remote machine</em> set to the IP name of the primary interface of the local host.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>bind interfaces only</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>blocking locks (S)</p><p>This parameter controls the behavior of <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> when given a request by a client to obtain a byte range lock on a region of an open file, and the request has a time limit associated with it.</p><p>If this parameter is set and the lock range requested cannot be immediately satisfied, samba will internally queue the lock request, and periodically attempt to obtain the lock until the timeout period expires.</p><p>If this parameter is set to <strong>no</strong>, then samba will behave as previous versions of Samba would and will fail the lock request immediately if the lock range cannot be obtained.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>blocking locks</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>block size (S)</p><p>This parameter controls the behavior of <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> when reporting disk free sizes.

With the current Samba architecture it happens that Samba takes a lock and while holding that lock makes file system calls into the shared cluster file system. This option makes Samba warn if it detects that it has held locks for the specified number of milliseconds. If this happens, <em>smbd</em> will emit a debug level 0 message into its logs and potentially into syslog. The most likely reason for such a log message is that an operation of the cluster file system Samba exports is taking longer than expected. The messages are meant as a debugging aid for potential cluster problems.</p><p>The default value of 0 disables this logging.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>ctdb locktime warn threshold</em><em> = </em><em>0</em><em> </em></p><p>ctdb timeout (G)</p><p>This parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for the connection between Samba and ctdb. It is only valid if you have compiled Samba with clustering and if you have set <em>clustering=yes</em>.</p><p>When something in the cluster blocks, it can happen that we wait indefinitely long for ctdb, just adding to the blocking condition. In a well-running cluster this should never happen, but there are too many components in a cluster that might have hickups. Choosing the right balance for this value is very tricky, because on a busy cluster long service times to transfer something across the cluster might be valid. Setting it too short will degrade the service your cluster presents, setting it too long might make the cluster itself not recover from something severely broken for too long.</p><p>Be aware that if you set this parameter, this needs to be in the file smb.conf, it is not really helpful to put this into a registry configuration (typical on a cluster), because to access the registry contact to ctdb is required.</p><p>Setting <em>ctdb timeout</em> to n makes any process waiting longer than n seconds for a reply by the cluster panic. Setting it to 0 (the default) makes Samba block forever, which is the highly recommended default.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>ctdb timeout</em><em> = </em><em>0</em><em> </em></p><p>cups connection timeout (G)</p><p>This parameter is only applicable if \m[blue]<strong>printing</strong>\m[] is set to <strong>cups</strong>.</p><p>If set, this option specifies the number of seconds that smbd will wait whilst trying to contact to the CUPS server.

When smbd is serving Printer Drivers to Windows NT/2k/XP clients, each printer on the Samba server has a Device Mode which defines things such as paper size and orientation and duplex settings. The device mode can only correctly be generated by the printer driver itself (which can only be executed on a Win32 platform). Because smbd is unable to execute the driver code to generate the device mode, the default behavior is to set this field to NULL.</p><p>Most problems with serving printer drivers to Windows NT/2k/XP clients can be traced to a problem with the generated device mode. Certain drivers will do things such as crashing the client&apos;s Explorer.exe with a NULL devmode. However, other printer drivers can cause the client&apos;s spooler service (spoolsv.exe) to die if the devmode was not created by the driver itself (i.e. smbd generates a default devmode).</p><p>This parameter should be used with care and tested with the printer driver in question. It is better to leave the device mode to NULL and let the Windows client set the correct values.

Run <a href="../man1/testparm.1.html"><strong>testparm</strong>(1)</a> to check the default on your system.</p><p><em>No default</em></p><p>dos filemode (S)</p><p>The default behavior in Samba is to provide UNIX-like behavior where only the owner of a file/directory is able to change the permissions on it. However, this behavior is often confusing to DOS/Windows users. Enabling this parameter allows a user who has write access to the file (by whatever means, including an ACL permission) to modify the permissions (including ACL) on it. Note that a user belonging to the group owning the file will not be allowed to change permissions if the group is only granted read access. Ownership of the file/directory may also be changed. Note that using the VFS modules acl_xattr or acl_tdb which store native Windows as meta-data will automatically turn this option on for any share for which they are loaded, as they require this option to emulate Windows ACLs correctly.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>dos filemode</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>dos filetime resolution (S)</p><p>Under the DOS and Windows FAT filesystem, the finest granularity on time resolution is two seconds.

If oplocks are enabled on a share, Visual C++ uses two different time reading calls to check if a file has changed since it was last read. One of these calls uses a one-second granularity, the other uses a two second granularity. As the two second call rounds any odd second down, then if the file has a timestamp of an odd number of seconds then the two timestamps will not match and Visual C++ will keep reporting the file has changed. Setting this option causes the two timestamps to match, and Visual C++ is happy.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>dos filetime resolution</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>dos filetimes (S)</p><p>Under DOS and Windows, if a user can write to a file they can change the timestamp on it. Under POSIX semantics, only the owner of the file or root may change the timestamp. By default, Samba emulates the DOS semantics and allows to change the timestamp on a file if the user smbd is acting on behalf has write permissions. Due to changes in Microsoft Office 2000 and beyond, the default for this parameter has been changed from "no" to "yes" in Samba 3.0.14 and above. Microsoft Excel will display dialog box warnings about the file being changed by another user if this parameter is not set to "yes" and files are being shared between users.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>dos filetimes</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>durable handles (S)</p><p>This boolean parameter controls whether Samba can grant SMB2 durable file handles on a share.</p><p>Note that durable handles are only enabled if \m[blue]<strong>kernel oplocks = no</strong>\m[], \m[blue]<strong>kernel share modes = no</strong>\m[], and \m[blue]<strong>posix locking = no</strong>\m[], i.e. if the share is configured for CIFS/SMB2 only access, not supporting interoperability features with local UNIX processes or NFS operations.</p><p>Also note that, for the time being, durability is not granted for a handle that has the delete on close flag set.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>durable handles</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>ea support (S)</p><p>This boolean parameter controls whether <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> will allow clients to attempt to store OS/2 style Extended attributes on a share. In order to enable this parameter the underlying filesystem exported by the share must support extended attributes (such as provided on XFS and EXT3 on Linux, with the correct kernel patches).

To use encrypted passwords in Samba see the chapter "User Database" in the Samba HOWTO Collection.</p><p>MS Windows clients that expect Microsoft encrypted passwords and that do not have plain text password support enabled will be able to connect only to a Samba server that has encrypted password support enabled and for which the user accounts have a valid encrypted password. Refer to the smbpasswd command man page for information regarding the creation of encrypted passwords for user accounts.</p><p>The use of plain text passwords is NOT advised as support for this feature is no longer maintained in Microsoft Windows products.

The second enhancement consists of a regular randomised browse synchronization with all currently known DMBs.</p><p>You may wish to disable this option if you have a problem with empty workgroups not disappearing from browse lists. Due to the restrictions of the browse protocols, these enhancements can cause a empty workgroup to stay around forever which can be annoying.</p><p>In general you should leave this option enabled as it makes cross-subnet browse propagation much more reliable.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>enhanced browsing</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>enumports command (G)</p><p>The concept of a "port" is fairly foreign to UNIX hosts. Under Windows NT/2000 print servers, a port is associated with a port monitor and generally takes the form of a local port (i.e. LPT1:, COM1:, FILE:) or a remote port (i.e. LPD Port Monitor, etc...). By default, Samba has only one port defined--<strong>"Samba Printer Port"</strong>. Under Windows NT/2000, all printers must have a valid port name. If you wish to have a list of ports displayed (smbd does not use a port name for anything) other than the default <strong>"Samba Printer Port"</strong>, you can define <em>enumports command</em> to point to a program which should generate a list of ports, one per line, to standard output. This listing will then be used in response to the level 1 and 2 EnumPorts() RPC.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>enumports command</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>enumports command</em><em> = </em><em>/usr/bin/listports</em><em> </em></p><p>eventlog list (G)</p><p>This option defines a list of log names that Samba will report to the Microsoft EventViewer utility. The listed eventlogs will be associated with tdb file on disk in the $(statedir)/eventlog.</p><p>The administrator must use an external process to parse the normal Unix logs such as /var/log/messages and write then entries to the eventlog tdb files. Refer to the <a href="../man8/eventlogadm.8.html"><strong>eventlogadm</strong>(8)</a> utility for how to write eventlog entries.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>eventlog list</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>eventlog list</em><em> = </em><em>Security Application Syslog Apache</em><em> </em></p><p>fake directory create times (S)</p><p>NTFS and Windows VFAT file systems keep a create time for all files and directories. This is not the same as the ctime - status change time - that Unix keeps, so Samba by default reports the earliest of the various times Unix does keep. Setting this parameter for a share causes Samba to always report midnight 1-1-1980 as the create time for directories.</p><p>This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for Visual C++ when used against Samba shares. Visual C++ generated makefiles have the object directory as a dependency for each object file, and a make rule to create the directory. Also, when NMAKE compares timestamps it uses the creation time when examining a directory. Thus the object directory will be created if it does not exist, but once it does exist it will always have an earlier timestamp than the object files it contains.</p><p>However, Unix time semantics mean that the create time reported by Samba will be updated whenever a file is created or deleted in the directory. NMAKE finds all object files in the object directory. The timestamp of the last one built is then compared to the timestamp of the object directory. If the directory&apos;s timestamp if newer, then all object files will be rebuilt. Enabling this option ensures directories always predate their contents and an NMAKE build will proceed as expected.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>fake directory create times</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>fake oplocks (S)</p><p>Oplocks are the way that SMB clients get permission from a server to locally cache file operations. If a server grants an oplock (opportunistic lock) then the client is free to assume that it is the only one accessing the file and it will aggressively cache file data. With some oplock types the client may even cache file open/close operations. This can give enormous performance benefits.</p><p>When you set fake oplocks = yes, <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> will always grant oplock requests no matter how many clients are using the file.</p><p>It is generally much better to use the real \m[blue]<strong>oplocks</strong>\m[] support rather than this parameter.</p><p>If you enable this option on all read-only shares or shares that you know will only be accessed from one client at a time such as physically read-only media like CDROMs, you will see a big performance improvement on many operations. If you enable this option on shares where multiple clients may be accessing the files read-write at the same time you can get data corruption. Use this option carefully!</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>fake oplocks</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>follow symlinks (S)</p><p>This parameter allows the Samba administrator to stop <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> from following symbolic links in a particular share. Setting this parameter to <strong>no</strong> prevents any file or directory that is a symbolic link from being followed (the user will get an error). This option is very useful to stop users from adding a symbolic link to /etc/passwd in their home directory for instance.

Thus, by assigning permissions for this group to the files and directories within this service the Samba administrator can restrict or allow sharing of these files.</p><p>In Samba 2.0.5 and above this parameter has extended functionality in the following way. If the group name listed here has a &apos;+&apos; character prepended to it then the current user accessing the share only has the primary group default assigned to this group if they are already assigned as a member of that group. This allows an administrator to decide that only users who are already in a particular group will create files with group ownership set to that group. This gives a finer granularity of ownership assignment. For example, the setting force group = +sys means that only users who are already in group sys will have their default primary group assigned to sys when accessing this Samba share. All other users will retain their ordinary primary group.</p><p>If the \m[blue]<strong>force user</strong>\m[] parameter is also set the group specified in <em>force group</em> will override the primary group set in <em>force user</em>.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>force group</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>force group</em><em> = </em><em>agroup</em><em> </em></p><p>force printername (S)</p><p>When printing from Windows NT (or later), each printer in smb.conf has two associated names which can be used by the client. The first is the sharename (or shortname) defined in smb.conf. This is the only printername available for use by Windows 9x clients. The second name associated with a printer can be seen when browsing to the "Printers" (or "Printers and Faxes") folder on the Samba server. This is referred to simply as the printername (not to be confused with the <em>printer name</em> option).</p><p>When assigning a new driver to a printer on a remote Windows compatible print server such as Samba, the Windows client will rename the printer to match the driver name just uploaded. This can result in confusion for users when multiple printers are bound to the same driver. To prevent Samba from allowing the printer&apos;s printername to differ from the sharename defined in smb.conf, set <em>force printername = yes</em>.</p><p>Be aware that enabling this parameter may affect migrating printers from a Windows server to Samba since Windows has no way to force the sharename and printername to match.</p><p>It is recommended that this parameter&apos;s value not be changed once the printer is in use by clients as this could cause a user not be able to delete printer connections from their local Printers folder.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>force printername</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>force security mode (S)</p><p>This parameter has been removed for Samba 4.0.0.</p><p><em>No default</em></p><p>force unknown acl user (S)</p><p>If this parameter is set, a Windows NT ACL that contains an unknown SID (security descriptor, or representation of a user or group id) as the owner or group owner of the file will be silently mapped into the current UNIX uid or gid of the currently connected user.</p><p>This is designed to allow Windows NT clients to copy files and folders containing ACLs that were created locally on the client machine and contain users local to that machine only (no domain users) to be copied to a Samba server (usually with XCOPY /O) and have the unknown userid and groupid of the file owner map to the current connected user. This can only be fixed correctly when winbindd allows arbitrary mapping from any Windows NT SID to a UNIX uid or gid.</p><p>Try using this parameter when XCOPY /O gives an ACCESS_DENIED error.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>force unknown acl user</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>force user (S)</p><p>This specifies a UNIX user name that will be assigned as the default user for all users connecting to this service.

This is performed by Winbindd with a configurable plugin interface. Samba&apos;s ID mapping is configured by options starting with the \m[blue]<strong>idmap config</strong>\m[] prefix. An idmap option consists of the \m[blue]<strong>idmap config</strong>\m[] prefix, followed by a domain name or the asterisk character (*), a colon, and the name of an idmap setting for the chosen domain.</p><p>The idmap configuration is hence divided into groups, one group for each domain to be configured, and one group with the asterisk instead of a proper domain name, which specifies the default configuration that is used to catch all domains that do not have an explicit idmap configuration of their own.</p><p>There are three general options available:</p><p>backend = backend_name</p><p>This specifies the name of the idmap plugin to use as the SID/uid/gid backend for this domain. The standard backends are tdb (<a href="../man8/idmap_tdb.8.html"><strong>idmap_tdb</strong>(8)</a>), tdb2 (<a href="../man8/idmap_tdb2.8.html"><strong>idmap_tdb2</strong>(8)</a>), ldap (<a href="../man8/idmap_ldap.8.html"><strong>idmap_ldap</strong>(8)</a>), , rid (<a href="../man8/idmap_rid.8.html"><strong>idmap_rid</strong>(8)</a>), , hash (<a href="../man8/idmap_hash.8.html"><strong>idmap_hash</strong>(8)</a>), , autorid (<a href="../man8/idmap_autorid.8.html"><strong>idmap_autorid</strong>(8)</a>), , ad (<a href="../man8/idmap_ad.8.html"><strong>idmap_ad</strong>(8)</a>), , and nss. (<a href="../man8/idmap_nss.8.html"><strong>idmap_nss</strong>(8)</a>), The corresponding manual pages contain the details, but here is a summary.</p><p>The first three of these create mappings of their own using internal unixid counters and store the mappings in a database. These are suitable for use in the default idmap configuration. The rid and hash backends use a pure algorithmic calculation to determine the unixid for a SID. The autorid module is a mixture of the tdb and rid backend. It creates ranges for each domain encountered and then uses the rid algorithm for each of these automatically configured domains individually. The ad backend usees unix IDs stored in Active Directory via the standard schema extensions. The nss backend reverses the standard winbindd setup and gets the unixids via names from nsswitch which can be useful in an ldap setup.</p><p>range = low - high</p><p>Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the backend is authoritative. For allocating backends, this also defines the start and the end of the range for allocating new unique IDs.</p><p>winbind uses this parameter to find the backend that is authoritative for a unix ID to SID mapping, so it must be set for each individually configured domain and for the default configuration. The configured ranges must be mutually disjoint.</p><p>read only = yes|no</p><p>This option can be used to turn the writing backends tdb, tdb2, and ldap into read only mode. This can be useful e.g. in cases where a pre-filled database exists that should not be extended automatically.</p><p>The following example illustrates how to configure the <a href="../man8/idmap_ad.8.html"><strong>idmap_ad</strong>(8)</a> backend for the CORP domain and the <a href="../man8/idmap_tdb.8.html"><strong>idmap_tdb</strong>(8)</a> backend for all other domains. This configuration assumes that the admin of CORP assigns unix ids below 1000000 via the SFU extensions, and winbind is supposed to use the next million entries for its own mappings from trusted domains and for local groups for example.</p>

This option also requires a running winbindd as it is used to allocate new uids/gids on user/group creation. The allocation range must be therefore configured.</p><p>To use this option, a basic ldap tree must be provided and the ldap suffix parameters must be properly configured. On virgin servers the default users and groups (Administrator, Guest, Domain Users, Domain Admins, Domain Guests) can be precreated with the command net sam provision. To run this command the ldap server must be running, Winbindd must be running and the smb.conf ldap options must be properly configured.

<p>Default: <em></em><em>ldapsam:editposix</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>ldapsam:trusted (G)</p><p>By default, Samba as a Domain Controller with an LDAP backend needs to use the Unix-style NSS subsystem to access user and group information. Due to the way Unix stores user information in /etc/passwd and /etc/group this inevitably leads to inefficiencies. One important question a user needs to know is the list of groups he is member of. The plain UNIX model involves a complete enumeration of the file /etc/group and its NSS counterparts in LDAP. UNIX has optimized functions to enumerate group membership. Sadly, other functions that are used to deal with user and group attributes lack such optimization.</p><p>To make Samba scale well in large environments, the \m[blue]<strong>ldapsam:trusted = yes</strong>\m[] option assumes that the complete user and group database that is relevant to Samba is stored in LDAP with the standard posixAccount/posixGroup attributes. It further assumes that the Samba auxiliary object classes are stored together with the POSIX data in the same LDAP object. If these assumptions are met, \m[blue]<strong>ldapsam:trusted = yes</strong>\m[] can be activated and Samba can bypass the NSS system to query user group memberships. Optimized LDAP queries can greatly speed up domain logon and administration tasks.

It allows you to do</p><p>C:&#92;&gt;<strong>NET USE H: /HOME</strong></p><p>from a command prompt, for example.</p><p>This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have separate logon scripts for each user or machine.</p><p>This parameter can be used with Win9X workstations to ensure that roaming profiles are stored in a subdirectory of the user&apos;s home directory. This is done in the following way:</p><p>logon home = &#92;&#92;%N&#92;%U&#92;profile</p><p>This tells Samba to return the above string, with substitutions made when a client requests the info, generally in a NetUserGetInfo request. Win9X clients truncate the info to &#92;&#92;server&#92;share when a user does net use /home but use the whole string when dealing with profiles.</p><p>Note that in prior versions of Samba, the \m[blue]<strong>logon path</strong>\m[] was returned rather than <em>logon home</em>. This broke net use /home but allowed profiles outside the home directory. The current implementation is correct, and can be used for profiles if you use the above trick.</p><p>Disable this feature by setting \m[blue]<strong>logon home = ""</strong>\m[] - using the empty string.</p><p>This option is only useful if Samba is set up as a logon server.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>logon home</em><em> = </em><em>&#92;&#92;%N&#92;%U</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>logon home</em><em> = </em><em>&#92;&#92;remote_smb_server&#92;%U</em><em> </em></p><p>logon path (G)</p><p>This parameter specifies the directory where roaming profiles (Desktop, NTuser.dat, etc) are stored. Contrary to previous versions of these manual pages, it has nothing to do with Win 9X roaming profiles. To find out how to handle roaming profiles for Win 9X system, see the \m[blue]<strong>logon home</strong>\m[] parameter.</p><p>This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have separate logon scripts for each user or machine. It also specifies the directory from which the "Application Data", desktop, start menu, network neighborhood, programs and other folders, and their contents, are loaded and displayed on your Windows NT client.</p><p>The share and the path must be readable by the user for the preferences and directories to be loaded onto the Windows NT client. The share must be writeable when the user logs in for the first time, in order that the Windows NT client can create the NTuser.dat and other directories. Thereafter, the directories and any of the contents can, if required, be made read-only. It is not advisable that the NTuser.dat file be made read-only - rename it to NTuser.man to achieve the desired effect (a <em>MAN</em>datory profile).</p><p>Windows clients can sometimes maintain a connection to the [homes] share, even though there is no user logged in. Therefore, it is vital that the logon path does not include a reference to the homes share (i.e. setting this parameter to &#92;&#92;%N&#92;homes&#92;profile_path will cause problems).</p><p>This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have separate logon scripts for each user or machine.</p><p><strong>Warning</strong></p><p>Do not quote the value. Setting this as &ldquo;&#92;&#92;%N&#92;profile&#92;%U&rdquo; will break profile handling. Where the tdbsam or ldapsam passdb backend is used, at the time the user account is created the value configured for this parameter is written to the passdb backend and that value will over-ride the parameter value present in the smb.conf file. Any error present in the passdb backend account record must be editted using the appropriate tool (pdbedit on the command-line, or any other locally provided system tool).</p><p>Note that this option is only useful if Samba is set up as a domain controller.</p><p>Disable the use of roaming profiles by setting the value of this parameter to the empty string. For example, \m[blue]<strong>logon path = ""</strong>\m[]. Take note that even if the default setting in the smb.conf file is the empty string, any value specified in the user account settings in the passdb backend will over-ride the effect of setting this parameter to null. Disabling of all roaming profile use requires that the user account settings must also be blank.</p><p>An example of use is:</p>
<pre>

The file must contain the DOS style CR/LF line endings. Using a DOS-style editor to create the file is recommended.</p><p>The script must be a relative path to the <em>[netlogon]</em> service. If the [netlogon] service specifies a \m[blue]<strong>path</strong>\m[] of /usr/local/samba/netlogon, and \m[blue]<strong>logon script = STARTUP.BAT</strong>\m[], then the file that will be downloaded is:</p>
<pre>
	/usr/local/samba/netlogon/STARTUP.BAT
</pre>
<p>The contents of the batch file are entirely your choice. A suggested command would be to add NET TIME &#92;&#92;SERVER /SET /YES, to force every machine to synchronize clocks with the same time server. Another use would be to add NET USE U: &#92;&#92;SERVER&#92;UTILS for commonly used utilities, or</p>
<pre>
<strong>NET USE Q: &#92;&#92;SERVER&#92;ISO9001_QA</strong>
</pre>
<p>for example.</p><p>Note that it is particularly important not to allow write access to the [netlogon] share, or to grant users write permission on the batch files in a secure environment, as this would allow the batch files to be arbitrarily modified and security to be breached.</p><p>This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have separate logon scripts for each user or machine.</p><p>This option is only useful if Samba is set up as a logon server.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>logon script</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>logon script</em><em> = </em><em>scripts&#92;%U.bat</em><em> </em></p><p>log writeable files on exit (G)</p><p>When the network connection between a CIFS client and Samba dies, Samba has no option but to simply shut down the server side of the network connection. If this happens, there is a risk of data corruption because the Windows client did not complete all write operations that the Windows application requested. Setting this option to "yes" makes smbd log with a level 0 message a list of all files that have been opened for writing when the network connection died. Those are the files that are potentially corrupted. It is meant as an aid for the administrator to give him a list of files to do consistency checks on.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>log writeable files on exit</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>lppause command (S)</p><p>This parameter specifies the command to be executed on the server host in order to stop printing or spooling a specific print job.</p><p>This command should be a program or script which takes a printer name and job number to pause the print job.

A <em>%j</em> is replaced with the job number (an integer). On HPUX (see <em>printing=hpux </em>), if the <em>-p%p</em> option is added to the lpq command, the job will show up with the correct status, i.e. if the job priority is lower than the set fence priority it will have the PAUSED status, whereas if the priority is equal or higher it will have the SPOOLED or PRINTING status.</p><p>Note that it is good practice to include the absolute path in the lppause command as the PATH may not be available to the server.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>lppause command</em><em> = </em><em> # Currently no default value is given to this string, unless the value of the \m[blue]</em><strong>printing</strong>\m[] parameter is <strong>SYSV</strong>, in which case the default is : lp -i %p-%j -H hold or if the value of the <em>printing</em> parameter is <strong>SOFTQ</strong>, then the default is: qstat -s -j%j -h. <em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>lppause command</em><em> = </em><em>/usr/bin/lpalt %p-%j -p0</em><em> </em></p><p>lpq cache time (G)</p><p>This controls how long lpq info will be cached for to prevent the lpq command being called too often.

To get around this, the server reports on the first printer service connected to by the client. This only happens if the connection number sent is invalid.</p><p>If a <em>%p</em> is given then the printer name is put in its place.

If \m[blue]<strong>store dos attributes</strong>\m[] is set to <strong>yes</strong> then this parameter is <em>ignored</em>. This is a new parameter introduced in Samba version 3.0.21.</p><p>The three settings are :</p><p><strong>Yes</strong> - The read only DOS attribute is mapped to the inverse of the user or owner write bit in the unix permission mode set. If the owner write bit is not set, the read only attribute is reported as being set on the file. If the read only DOS attribute is set, Samba sets the owner, group and others write bits to zero. Write bits set in an ACL are ignored by Samba. If the read only DOS attribute is unset, Samba simply sets the write bit of the owner to one.</p><p><strong>Permissions</strong> - The read only DOS attribute is mapped to the effective permissions of the connecting user, as evaluated by <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> by reading the unix permissions and POSIX ACL (if present). If the connecting user does not have permission to modify the file, the read only attribute is reported as being set on the file.</p><p><strong>No</strong> - The read only DOS attribute is unaffected by permissions, and can only be set by the \m[blue]<strong>store dos attributes</strong>\m[] method.

Note that this can cause problems as it means that any user incorrectly typing their password will be silently logged on as "guest" - and will not know the reason they cannot access files they think they should - there will have been no message given to them that they got their password wrong. Helpdesk services will <em>hate</em> you if you set the <em>map to guest</em> parameter this way :-).</p><p><strong>Bad Uid</strong> - Is only applicable when Samba is configured in some type of domain mode security (security = {domain|ads}) and means that user logins which are successfully authenticated but which have no valid Unix user account (and smbd is unable to create one) should be mapped to the defined guest account. This was the default behavior of Samba 2.x releases. Note that if a member server is running winbindd, this option should never be required because the nss_winbind library will export the Windows domain users and groups to the underlying OS via the Name Service Switch interface.</p><p>Note that this parameter is needed to set up "Guest" share services. This is because in these modes the name of the resource being requested is <em>not</em> sent to the server until after the server has successfully authenticated the client so the server cannot make authentication decisions at the correct time (connection to the share) for "Guest" shares.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>map to guest</em><em> = </em><em>Never</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>map to guest</em><em> = </em><em>Bad User</em><em> </em></p><p>map untrusted to domain (G)</p><p>If a client connects to smbd using an untrusted domain name, such as BOGUS&#92;user, smbd replaces the BOGUS domain with it&apos;s SAM name before attempting to authenticate that user.

In the case where smbd is acting as a domain member server or a standalone server this will be WORKSTATION&#92;user.</p><p>In previous versions of Samba (pre 3.4), if smbd was acting as a domain member server, the BOGUS domain name would instead be replaced by the primary domain which smbd was a member of. In this case authentication would be deferred off to a DC using the credentials DOMAIN&#92;user.</p><p>When this parameter is set to <strong>yes</strong> smbd provides the legacy behavior of mapping untrusted domain names to the primary domain.

Any incoming SMBwriteX call on a non-signed SMB/CIFS connection greater than this value will not be processed in the normal way but will be passed to any underlying kernel recvfile or splice system call (if there is no such call Samba will emulate in user space). This allows zero-copy writes directly from network socket buffers into the filesystem buffer cache, if available. It may improve performance but user testing is recommended. If set to zero Samba processes SMBwriteX calls in the normal way. To enable POSIX large write support (SMB/CIFS writes up to 16Mb) this option must be nonzero. The maximum value is 128k.

Its main purpose to is to control how netbios name resolution is performed. The option takes a space separated string of name resolution options.</p><p>The options are: "lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast". They cause names to be resolved as follows:</p><p><strong>lmhosts</strong> : Lookup an IP address in the Samba lmhosts file. If the line in lmhosts has no name type attached to the NetBIOS name (see the manpage for lmhosts for details) then any name type matches for lookup.</p><p><strong>host</strong> : Do a standard host name to IP address resolution, using the system /etc/hosts, NIS, or DNS lookups. This method of name resolution is operating system depended for instance on IRIX or Solaris this may be controlled by the /etc/nsswitch.conf file. Note that this method is used only if the NetBIOS name type being queried is the 0x20 (server) name type or 0x1c (domain controllers). The latter case is only useful for active directory domains and results in a DNS query for the SRV RR entry matching _ldap._tcp.domain.</p><p><strong>wins</strong> : Query a name with the IP address listed in the \m[blue]<strong>WINSSERVER</strong>\m[] parameter. If no WINS server has been specified this method will be ignored.</p><p><strong>bcast</strong> : Do a broadcast on each of the known local interfaces listed in the \m[blue]<strong>interfaces</strong>\m[] parameter. This is the least reliable of the name resolution methods as it depends on the target host being on a locally connected subnet.</p><p>The example below will cause the local lmhosts file to be examined first, followed by a broadcast attempt, followed by a normal system hostname lookup.</p><p>When Samba is functioning in ADS security mode (security = ads) it is advised to use following settings for <em>name resolve order</em>:</p><p>name resolve order = wins bcast</p><p>DC lookups will still be done via DNS, but fallbacks to netbios names will not inundate your DNS servers with needless querys for DOMAIN&lt;0x1c&gt; lookups.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>name resolve order</em><em> = </em><em>lmhosts wins host bcast</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>name resolve order</em><em> = </em><em>lmhosts bcast host</em><em> </em></p><p>socket address</p><p>This parameter is a synonym for nbt client socket address.</p><p>nbt client socket address (G)</p><p>This option allows you to control what address Samba will send NBT client packets from, and process replies using, including in nmbd.</p><p>Setting this option should never be necessary on usual Samba servers running only one nmbd.</p><p>By default Samba will send UDP packets from the OS default address for the destination, and accept replies on 0.0.0.0.</p><p>This parameter is deprecated.

For UNIX systems that use an automounter, the user&apos;s home directory will often be mounted on a workstation on demand from a remote server.</p><p>When the Samba logon server is not the actual home directory server, but is mounting the home directories via NFS then two network hops would be required to access the users home directory if the logon server told the client to use itself as the SMB server for home directories (one over SMB and one over NFS). This can be very slow.</p><p>This option allows Samba to return the home share as being on a different server to the logon server and as long as a Samba daemon is running on the home directory server, it will be mounted on the Samba client directly from the directory server. When Samba is returning the home share to the client, it will consult the NIS map specified in \m[blue]<strong>homedir map</strong>\m[] and return the server listed there.</p><p>Note that for this option to work there must be a working NIS system and the Samba server with this option must also be a logon server.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>NIS homedir</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>nmbd bind explicit broadcast (G)</p><p>This option causes <a href="../man8/nmbd.8.html"><strong>nmbd</strong>(8)</a> to explicitly bind to the broadcast address of the local subnets.

<p>Default: <em></em><em>passdb backend</em><em> = </em><em>tdbsam</em><em> </em></p><p>passdb expand explicit (G)</p><p>This parameter controls whether Samba substitutes %-macros in the passdb fields if they are explicitly set. We used to expand macros here, but this turned out to be a bug because the Windows client can expand a variable %G_osver% in which %G would have been substituted by the user&apos;s primary group.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>passdb expand explicit</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>passwd chat debug (G)</p><p>This boolean specifies if the passwd chat script parameter is run in <em>debug</em> mode. In this mode the strings passed to and received from the passwd chat are printed in the <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> log with a \m[blue]<strong>debug level</strong>\m[] of 100. This is a dangerous option as it will allow plaintext passwords to be seen in the smbd log. It is available to help Samba admins debug their <em>passwd chat</em> scripts when calling the <em>passwd program</em> and should be turned off after this has been done. This option has no effect if the \m[blue]<strong>pam password change</strong>\m[] parameter is set. This parameter is off by default.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>passwd chat debug</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>passwd chat timeout (G)</p><p>This integer specifies the number of seconds smbd will wait for an initial answer from a passwd chat script being run.

The string describes a sequence of response-receive pairs that <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> uses to determine what to send to the \m[blue]<strong>passwd program</strong>\m[] and what to expect back. If the expected output is not received then the password is not changed.</p><p>This chat sequence is often quite site specific, depending on what local methods are used for password control (such as NIS etc).</p><p>Note that this parameter only is used if the \m[blue]<strong>unix password sync</strong>\m[] parameter is set to <strong>yes</strong>. This sequence is then called <em>AS ROOT</em> when the SMB password in the smbpasswd file is being changed, without access to the old password cleartext. This means that root must be able to reset the user&apos;s password without knowing the text of the previous password. In the presence of NIS/YP, this means that the \m[blue]<strong>passwd program</strong>\m[] must be executed on the NIS master.</p><p>The string can contain the macro <em>%n</em> which is substituted for the new password. The old passsword (<em>%o</em>) is only available when \m[blue]<strong>encrypt passwords</strong>\m[] has been disabled. The chat sequence can also contain the standard macros &#92;n, &#92;r, &#92;t and &#92;s to give line-feed, carriage-return, tab and space. The chat sequence string can also contain a &apos;*&apos; which matches any sequence of characters. Double quotes can be used to collect strings with spaces in them into a single string.</p><p>If the send string in any part of the chat sequence is a full stop ".", then no string is sent. Similarly, if the expect string is a full stop then no string is expected.</p><p>If the \m[blue]<strong>pam password change</strong>\m[] parameter is set to <strong>yes</strong>, the chat pairs may be matched in any order, and success is determined by the PAM result, not any particular output.

Any occurrences of <em>%u</em> will be replaced with the user name. The user name is checked for existence before calling the password changing program.</p><p>Also note that many passwd programs insist in <em>reasonable </em> passwords, such as a minimum length, or the inclusion of mixed case chars and digits. This can pose a problem as some clients (such as Windows for Workgroups) uppercase the password before sending it.</p><p><em>Note</em> that if the <em>unix password sync</em> parameter is set to <strong>yes </strong> then this program is called <em>AS ROOT</em> before the SMB password in the smbpasswd file is changed. If this UNIX password change fails, then smbd will fail to change the SMB password also (this is by design).</p><p>If the <em>unix password sync</em> parameter is set this parameter <em>MUST USE ABSOLUTE PATHS</em> for <em>ALL</em> programs called, and must be examined for security implications.

This allows the domain to be maintained (addition and removal of domain controllers) without modification to the smb.conf file. The cryptographic protection on the authenticated RPC calls used to verify passwords ensures that this default is safe.</p><p><em>It is strongly recommended that you use the default of &apos;*&apos;</em>, however if in your particular environment you have reason to specify a particular DC list, then the list of machines in this option must be a list of names or IP addresses of Domain controllers for the Domain. If you use the default of &apos;*&apos;, or list several hosts in the <em>password server</em> option then smbd will try each in turn till it finds one that responds. This is useful in case your primary server goes down.</p><p>If the list of servers contains both names/IP&apos;s and the &apos;*&apos; character, the list is treated as a list of preferred domain controllers, but an auto lookup of all remaining DC&apos;s will be added to the list as well.

This is not mandatory of course, but you probably won&apos;t get the results you expect if you do otherwise.</p><p>Any occurrences of <em>%u</em> in the path will be replaced with the UNIX username that the client is using on this connection. Any occurrences of <em>%m</em> will be replaced by the NetBIOS name of the machine they are connecting from. These replacements are very useful for setting up pseudo home directories for users.</p><p>Note that this path will be based on \m[blue]<strong>root dir</strong>\m[] if one was specified.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>path</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>path</em><em> = </em><em>/home/fred</em><em> </em></p><p>perfcount module (G)</p><p>This parameter specifies the perfcount backend to be used when monitoring SMB operations.

See the discussion of the [printers] section above for reasons why you might want to do this.</p><p>To use the CUPS printing interface set printcap name = cups. This should be supplemented by an additional setting \m[blue]<strong>printing = cups</strong>\m[] in the [global] section. printcap name = cups will use the "dummy" printcap created by CUPS, as specified in your CUPS configuration file.</p><p>On System V systems that use lpstat to list available printers you can use printcap name = lpstat to automatically obtain lists of available printers. This is the default for systems that define SYSV at configure time in Samba (this includes most System V based systems). If <em> printcap name</em> is set to lpstat on these systems then Samba will launch lpstat -v and attempt to parse the output to obtain a printer list.</p><p>A minimal printcap file would look something like this:</p>
<pre>
print1|My Printer 1
print2|My Printer 2
print3|My Printer 3
print4|My Printer 4
print5|My Printer 5
</pre>
<p>where the &apos;|&apos; separates aliases of a printer. The fact that the second alias has a space in it gives a hint to Samba that it&apos;s a comment.</p><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>Under AIX the default printcap name is /etc/qconfig. Samba will assume the file is in AIX qconfig format if the string qconfig appears in the printcap filename.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>printcap name</em><em> = </em><em>/etc/printcap</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>printcap name</em><em> = </em><em>/etc/myprintcap</em><em> </em></p><p>print command (S)</p><p>After a print job has finished spooling to a service, this command will be used via a system() call to process the spool file. Typically the command specified will submit the spool file to the host&apos;s printing subsystem, but there is no requirement that this be the case. The server will not remove the spool file, so whatever command you specify should remove the spool file when it has been processed, otherwise you will need to manually remove old spool files.</p><p>The print command is simply a text string. It will be used verbatim after macro substitutions have been made:</p><p>%s, %f - the path to the spool file name</p><p>%p - the appropriate printer name</p><p>%J - the job name as transmitted by the client.</p><p>%c - The number of printed pages of the spooled job (if known).</p><p>%z - the size of the spooled print job (in bytes)</p><p>The print command <em>MUST</em> contain at least one occurrence of <em>%s</em> or <em>%f </em> - the <em>%p</em> is optional. At the time a job is submitted, if no printer name is supplied the <em>%p </em> will be silently removed from the printer command.</p><p>If specified in the [global] section, the print command given will be used for any printable service that does not have its own print command specified.</p><p>If there is neither a specified print command for a printable service nor a global print command, spool files will be created but not processed and (most importantly) not removed.</p><p>Note that printing may fail on some UNIXes from the <strong>nobody</strong> account. If this happens then create an alternative guest account that can print and set the \m[blue]<strong>guest account</strong>\m[] in the [global] section.</p><p>You can form quite complex print commands by realizing that they are just passed to a shell. For example the following will log a print job, print the file, then remove it. Note that &apos;;&apos; is the usual separator for command in shell scripts.</p><p>print command = echo Printing %s &gt;&gt; /tmp/print.log; lpr -P %p %s; rm %s</p><p>You may have to vary this command considerably depending on how you normally print files on your system.

Due to client firewall settings this can cause considerable timeouts and will often fail, as there is no guarantee the client is even running an SMB server. By setting this parameter to <strong>no</strong> the Samba print server will not try to connect back to clients and treat corresponding requests as if the connection back to the client failed. The default setting of <strong>yes</strong> causes smbd to attempt this connection.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>print notify backchannel</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>private directory</p><p>This parameter is a synonym for private dir.</p><p>private dir (G)</p><p>This parameters defines the directory smbd will use for storing such files as smbpasswd and secrets.tdb (or secrets.ntdb).</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>private dir</em><em> = </em><em>${prefix}/private</em><em> </em></p><p>profile acls (S)</p><p>This boolean parameter was added to fix the problems that people have been having with storing user profiles on Samba shares from Windows 2000 or Windows XP clients. New versions of Windows 2000 or Windows XP service packs do security ACL checking on the owner and ability to write of the profile directory stored on a local workstation when copied from a Samba share.</p><p>When not in domain mode with winbindd then the security info copied onto the local workstation has no meaning to the logged in user (SID) on that workstation so the profile storing fails. Adding this parameter onto a share used for profile storage changes two things about the returned Windows ACL. Firstly it changes the owner and group owner of all reported files and directories to be BUILTIN&#92;&#92;Administrators, BUILTIN&#92;&#92;Users respectively (SIDs S-1-5-32-544, S-1-5-32-545). Secondly it adds an ACE entry of "Full Control" to the SID BUILTIN&#92;&#92;Users to every returned ACL. This will allow any Windows 2000 or XP workstation user to access the profile.</p><p>Note that if you have multiple users logging on to a workstation then in order to prevent them from being able to access each others profiles you must remove the "Bypass traverse checking" advanced user right. This will prevent access to other users profile directories as the top level profile directory (named after the user) is created by the workstation profile code and has an ACL restricting entry to the directory tree to the owning user.</p><p>Note that this parameter should be set to yes on dedicated profile shares only. On other shares, it might cause incorrect file ownerships.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>profile acls</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>queuepause command (S)</p><p>This parameter specifies the command to be executed on the server host in order to pause the printer queue.</p><p>This command should be a program or script which takes a printer name as its only parameter and stops the printer queue, such that no longer jobs are submitted to the printer.</p><p>This command is not supported by Windows for Workgroups, but can be issued from the Printers window under Windows 95 and NT.</p><p>If a <em>%p</em> is given then the printer name is put in its place.

Please also consider whether or not you need to rename the actual home directories themselves.

To maintain full operability of the server you will need to mirror some system files into the <em>root directory</em> tree.

<pre>

</pre>
<p>The classic method is to run rpc services as internal daemons embedded in smbd, therefore the external daemons are <em>disabled</em> by default.</p><p>Choosing the <em>fork</em> option will cause samba to fork a separate proces for each daemon configured this way. Each daemon may in turn fork a number of children used to handle requests from multiple smbds and direct tcp/ip connections (if the Endpoint Mapper is enabled). Communication with smbd happens over named pipes and require that said pipes are forward to the external daemon (see \m[blue]<strong>rpc_server</strong>\m[]).</p><p>Forked RPC Daemons support dynamically forking children to handle connections. The heuristics about how many children to keep around and how fast to allow them to fork and also how many clients each child is allowed to handle concurrently is defined by parametrical options named after the daemon. Five options are currently supported:</p>
<pre>
		prefork_min_children
		prefork_max_children
		prefork_spawn_rate
		prefork_max_allowed_clients
		prefork_child_min_life

</pre>
<p>To set one of these options use the follwing syntax:</p>
<pre>
	damonname:prefork_min_children = 5

</pre>
<p>Samba includes separate daemons for spoolss and the lsarpc/lsass, netlogon and samr pipes. Currently three daemons are available and they are called:</p>
<pre>
		epmd
		lsasd
		spoolssd

</pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
	rpc_daemon:spoolssd = fork

</pre>
<p>Default: <em></em><em>rpc_daemon:DAEMON</em><em> = </em><em>disabled</em><em> </em></p><p>rpc_server:SERVER (G)</p><p>With this option you can define if a rpc service should be running internal/embedded in smbd or should be redirected to an external daemon like Samba4, the endpoint mapper daemon, the spoolss daemon or the new LSA service daemon. The rpc_server prefix must be followed by the pipe name, and a value.</p><p>This option can be set for each available rpc service in Samba. The following list shows all available pipe names services you can modify with this option.</p><p>epmapper - Endpoint Mapper</p><p>winreg - Remote Registry Service</p><p>srvsvc - Remote Server Services</p><p>lsarpc - Local Security Authority</p><p>samr - Security Account Management</p><p>netlogon - Netlogon Remote Protocol</p><p>netdfs - Settings for Distributed File System</p><p>dssetup - Active Directory Setup</p><p>wkssvc - Workstation Services</p><p>spoolss - Network Printing Spooler</p><p>svcctl - Service Control</p><p>ntsvcs - Plug and Play Services</p><p>eventlog - Event Logger</p><p>initshutdown - Init Shutdown Service</p><p>Three possible values currently supported are: embeddedexternaldisabled</p><p>The classic method is to run every pipe as an internal function <em>embedded</em> in smbd. The defaults may vary depending on the service.</p><p>Choosing the <em>external</em> option allows to run a separate daemon or even a completely independent (3rd party) server capable of interfacing with samba via the MS-RPC interface over named pipes.</p><p>Currently in Samba3 we support three daemons, spoolssd, epmd and lsasd. These daemons can be enabled using the <em>rpc_daemon</em> option. For spoolssd you have to enable the daemon and proxy the named pipe with:</p><p>Examples:</p>

It is an extension to the SMB/CIFS protocol negotiated as part of the UNIX extensions. SMB encryption uses the GSSAPI (SSPI on Windows) ability to encrypt and sign every request/response in a SMB protocol stream. When enabled it provides a secure method of SMB/CIFS communication, similar to an ssh protected session, but using SMB/CIFS authentication to negotiate encryption and signing keys. Currently this is only supported by Samba 3.2 smbclient, and hopefully soon Linux CIFSFS and MacOS/X clients. Windows clients do not support this feature.</p><p>This controls whether the remote client is allowed or required to use SMB encryption. Possible values are <em>auto</em>, <em>mandatory</em> and <em>disabled</em>. This may be set on a per-share basis, but clients may chose to encrypt the entire session, not just traffic to a specific share. If this is set to mandatory then all traffic to a share <em>must</em> be encrypted once the connection has been made to the share. The server would return "access denied" to all non-encrypted requests on such a share. Selecting encrypted traffic reduces throughput as smaller packet sizes must be used (no huge UNIX style read/writes allowed) as well as the overhead of encrypting and signing all the data.</p><p>If SMB encryption is selected, Windows style SMB signing (see the \m[blue]<strong>server signing</strong>\m[] option) is no longer necessary, as the GSSAPI flags use select both signing and sealing of the data.</p><p>When set to auto, SMB encryption is offered, but not enforced. When set to mandatory, SMB encryption is required and if set to disabled, SMB encryption can not be negotiated.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>smb encrypt</em><em> = </em><em>auto</em><em> </em></p><p>smb passwd file (G)</p><p>This option sets the path to the encrypted smbpasswd file. By default the path to the smbpasswd file is compiled into Samba.</p><p>An example of use is:</p>
<pre>
smb passwd file = /etc/samba/smbpasswd
</pre>
<p>Default: <em></em><em>smb passwd file</em><em> = </em><em>${prefix}/private/smbpasswd</em><em> </em></p><p>smb ports (G)</p><p>Specifies which ports the server should listen on for SMB traffic.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>smb ports</em><em> = </em><em>445 139</em><em> </em></p><p>socket options (G)</p><p><strong>Warning</strong></p><p>Modern server operating systems are tuned for high network performance in the majority of situations; when you set socket options you are overriding those settings. Linux in particular has an auto-tuning mechanism for buffer sizes that will be disabled if you specify a socket buffer size. This can potentially cripple your TCP/IP stack.</p><p>Getting the socket options correct can make a big difference to your performance, but getting them wrong can degrade it by just as much. As with any other low level setting, if you must make changes to it, make small changes and <em>test</em> the effect before making any large changes.</p><p>This option allows you to set socket options to be used when talking with the client.</p><p>Socket options are controls on the networking layer of the operating systems which allow the connection to be tuned.</p><p>This option will typically be used to tune your Samba server for optimal performance for your local network. There is no way that Samba can know what the optimal parameters are for your net, so you must experiment and choose them yourself. We strongly suggest you read the appropriate documentation for your operating system first (perhaps man setsockopt will help).</p><p>You may find that on some systems Samba will say "Unknown socket option" when you supply an option. This means you either incorrectly typed it or you need to add an include file to includes.h for your OS. If the latter is the case please send the patch to samba-technical@samba.org.</p><p>Any of the supported socket options may be combined in any way you like, as long as your OS allows it.</p><p>This is the list of socket options currently settable using this option:</p><p>SO_KEEPALIVE</p><p>SO_REUSEADDR</p><p>SO_BROADCAST</p><p>TCP_NODELAY</p><p>IPTOS_LOWDELAY</p><p>IPTOS_THROUGHPUT</p><p>SO_SNDBUF *</p><p>SO_RCVBUF *</p><p>SO_SNDLOWAT *</p><p>SO_RCVLOWAT *</p><p>Those marked with a <em>&apos;*&apos;</em> take an integer argument.

You should never need to change this parameter.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>stat cache</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>state directory (G)</p><p>Usually, most of the TDB files are stored in the <em>lock directory</em>. Since Samba 3.4.0, it is possible to differentiate between TDB files with persistent data and TDB files with non-persistent data using the <em>state directory</em> and the <em>cache directory</em> options.</p><p>This option specifies the directory where TDB files containing persistent data will be stored.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>state directory</em><em> = </em><em>${prefix}/var/locks</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>state directory</em><em> = </em><em>/var/run/samba/locks/state</em><em> </em></p><p>store dos attributes (S)</p><p>If this parameter is set Samba attempts to first read DOS attributes (SYSTEM, HIDDEN, ARCHIVE or READ-ONLY) from a filesystem extended attribute, before mapping DOS attributes to UNIX permission bits (such as occurs with \m[blue]<strong>map hidden</strong>\m[] and \m[blue]<strong>map readonly</strong>\m[]). When set, DOS attributes will be stored onto an extended attribute in the UNIX filesystem, associated with the file or directory. When this parameter is set it will override the parameters \m[blue]<strong>map hidden</strong>\m[], \m[blue]<strong>map system</strong>\m[], \m[blue]<strong>map archive</strong>\m[] and \m[blue]<strong>map readonly</strong>\m[] and they will behave as if they were set to off. This parameter writes the DOS attributes as a string into the extended attribute named "user.DOSATTRIB". This extended attribute is explicitly hidden from smbd clients requesting an EA list. On Linux the filesystem must have been mounted with the mount option user_xattr in order for extended attributes to work, also extended attributes must be compiled into the Linux kernel. In Samba 3.5.0 and above the "user.DOSATTRIB" extended attribute has been extended to store the create time for a file as well as the DOS attributes. This is done in a backwards compatible way so files created by Samba 3.5.0 and above can still have the DOS attribute read from this extended attribute by earlier versions of Samba, but they will not be able to read the create time stored there. Storing the create time separately from the normal filesystem meta-data allows Samba to faithfully reproduce NTFS semantics on top of a POSIX filesystem.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>store dos attributes</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>strict allocate (S)</p><p>This is a boolean that controls the handling of disk space allocation in the server. When this is set to <strong>yes</strong> the server will change from UNIX behaviour of not committing real disk storage blocks when a file is extended to the Windows behaviour of actually forcing the disk system to allocate real storage blocks when a file is created or extended to be a given size. In UNIX terminology this means that Samba will stop creating sparse files.</p><p>This option is really designed for file systems that support fast allocation of large numbers of blocks such as extent-based file systems. On file systems that don&apos;t support extents (most notably ext3) this can make Samba slower. When you work with large files over &gt;100MB on file systems without extents you may even run into problems with clients running into timeouts.</p><p>When you have an extent based filesystem it&apos;s likely that we can make use of unwritten extents which allows Samba to allocate even large amounts of space very fast and you will not see any timeout problems caused by strict allocate. With strict allocate in use you will also get much better out of quota messages in case you use quotas. Another advantage of activating this setting is that it will help to reduce file fragmentation.</p><p>To give you an idea on which filesystems this setting might currently be a good option for you: XFS, ext4, btrfs, ocfs2 on Linux and JFS2 on AIX support unwritten extents. On Filesystems that do not support it, preallocation is probably an expensive operation where you will see reduced performance and risk to let clients run into timeouts when creating large files. Examples are ext3, ZFS, HFS+ and most others, so be aware if you activate this setting on those filesystems.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>strict allocate</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>strict locking (S)</p><p>This is an enumerated type that controls the handling of file locking in the server. When this is set to <strong>yes</strong>, the server will check every read and write access for file locks, and deny access if locks exist. This can be slow on some systems.</p><p>When strict locking is set to Auto (the default), the server performs file lock checks only on non-oplocked files. As most Windows redirectors perform file locking checks locally on oplocked files this is a good trade off for improved performance.</p><p>When strict locking is disabled, the server performs file lock checks only when the client explicitly asks for them.</p><p>Well-behaved clients always ask for lock checks when it is important. So in the vast majority of cases, strict locking = Auto or strict locking = no is acceptable.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>strict locking</em><em> = </em><em>Auto</em><em> </em></p><p>strict sync (S)</p><p>Many Windows applications (including the Windows 98 explorer shell) seem to confuse flushing buffer contents to disk with doing a sync to disk. Under UNIX, a sync call forces the process to be suspended until the kernel has ensured that all outstanding data in kernel disk buffers has been safely stored onto stable storage. This is very slow and should only be done rarely. Setting this parameter to <strong>no</strong> (the default) means that <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> ignores the Windows applications requests for a sync call. There is only a possibility of losing data if the operating system itself that Samba is running on crashes, so there is little danger in this default setting. In addition, this fixes many performance problems that people have reported with the new Windows98 explorer shell file copies.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>strict sync</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>svcctl list (G)</p><p>This option defines a list of init scripts that smbd will use for starting and stopping Unix services via the Win32 ServiceControl API. This allows Windows administrators to utilize the MS Management Console plug-ins to manage a Unix server running Samba.</p><p>The administrator must create a directory name svcctl in Samba&apos;s $(libdir) and create symbolic links to the init scripts in /etc/init.d/. The name of the links must match the names given as part of the <em>svcctl list</em>.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>svcctl list</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>svcctl list</em><em> = </em><em>cups postfix portmap httpd</em><em> </em></p><p>sync always (S)</p><p>This is a boolean parameter that controls whether writes will always be written to stable storage before the write call returns. If this is <strong>no</strong> then the server will be guided by the client&apos;s request in each write call (clients can set a bit indicating that a particular write should be synchronous). If this is <strong>yes</strong> then every write will be followed by a fsync() call to ensure the data is written to disk. Note that the <em>strict sync</em> parameter must be set to <strong>yes</strong> in order for this parameter to have any effect.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>sync always</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>syslog only (G)</p><p>If this parameter is set then Samba debug messages are logged into the system syslog only, and not to the debug log files. There still will be some logging to log.[sn]mbd even if <em>syslog only</em> is enabled.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>syslog only</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>syslog (G)</p><p>This parameter maps how Samba debug messages are logged onto the system syslog logging levels. Samba debug level zero maps onto syslog <strong>LOG_ERR</strong>, debug level one maps onto <strong>LOG_WARNING</strong>, debug level two maps onto <strong>LOG_NOTICE</strong>, debug level three maps onto LOG_INFO. All higher levels are mapped to <strong>LOG_DEBUG</strong>.</p><p>This parameter sets the threshold for sending messages to syslog. Only messages with debug level less than this value will be sent to syslog. There still will be some logging to log.[sn]mbd even if <em>syslog only</em> is enabled.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>syslog</em><em> = </em><em>1</em><em> </em></p><p>template homedir (G)</p><p>When filling out the user information for a Windows NT user, the <a href="../man8/winbindd.8.html"><strong>winbindd</strong>(8)</a> daemon uses this parameter to fill in the home directory for that user.

These extensions enable Samba to better serve UNIX CIFS clients by supporting features such as symbolic links, hard links, etc... These extensions require a similarly enabled client, and are of no current use to Windows clients.</p><p>Note if this parameter is turned on, the \m[blue]<strong>wide links</strong>\m[] parameter will automatically be disabled.</p><p>See the parameter \m[blue]<strong>allow insecure wide links</strong>\m[] if you wish to change this coupling between the two parameters.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>unix extensions</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>unix password sync (G)</p><p>This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to synchronize the UNIX password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the smbpasswd file is changed. If this is set to <strong>yes</strong> the program specified in the <em>passwd program</em> parameter is called <em>AS ROOT</em> - to allow the new UNIX password to be set without access to the old UNIX password (as the SMB password change code has no access to the old password cleartext, only the new).</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>unix password sync</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>use client driver (S)</p><p>This parameter applies only to Windows NT/2000 clients. It has no effect on Windows 95/98/ME clients. When serving a printer to Windows NT/2000 clients without first installing a valid printer driver on the Samba host, the client will be required to install a local printer driver. From this point on, the client will treat the print as a local printer and not a network printer connection. This is much the same behavior that will occur when disable spoolss = yes.</p><p>The differentiating factor is that under normal circumstances, the NT/2000 client will attempt to open the network printer using MS-RPC. The problem is that because the client considers the printer to be local, it will attempt to issue the OpenPrinterEx() call requesting access rights associated with the logged on user. If the user possesses local administrator rights but not root privilege on the Samba host (often the case), the OpenPrinterEx() call will fail. The result is that the client will now display an "Access Denied; Unable to connect" message in the printer queue window (even though jobs may successfully be printed).</p><p>If this parameter is enabled for a printer, then any attempt to open the printer with the PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER right is mapped to PRINTER_ACCESS_USE instead. Thus allowing the OpenPrinterEx() call to succeed. <em>This parameter MUST not be enabled on a print share which has valid print driver installed on the Samba server.</em></p><p>Default: <em></em><em>use client driver</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>use mmap (G)</p><p>This global parameter determines if the tdb internals of Samba can depend on mmap working correctly on the running system. Samba requires a coherent mmap/read-write system memory cache. Currently only HPUX does not have such a coherent cache, and so this parameter is set to <strong>no</strong> by default on HPUX. On all other systems this parameter should be left alone. This parameter is provided to help the Samba developers track down problems with the tdb internal code.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>use mmap</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>use ntdb (G)</p><p>Beginning in Samba 4.1, a growing number of databases can use the NTDB format rather than TDB.</p><p>If you enable this option these databases will default to a .ntdb extension rather than .tdb. If the .tdb file exists, it will automatically be converted to NTDB and renamed to .tdb.bak.</p><p>Filenames explicitly specified in smb.conf will be respected (ie. the format will depend on the .ntdb or .tdb extension).</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>use ntdb</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>username level (G)</p><p>This option helps Samba to try and &apos;guess&apos; at the real UNIX username, as many DOS clients send an all-uppercase username. By default Samba tries all lowercase, followed by the username with the first letter capitalized, and fails if the username is not found on the UNIX machine.</p><p>If this parameter is set to non-zero the behavior changes. This parameter is a number that specifies the number of uppercase combinations to try while trying to determine the UNIX user name. The higher the number the more combinations will be tried, but the slower the discovery of usernames will be. Use this parameter when you have strange usernames on your UNIX machine, such as <strong>AstrangeUser </strong>.</p><p>This parameter is needed only on UNIX systems that have case sensitive usernames.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>username level</em><em> = </em><em>0</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>username level</em><em> = </em><em>5</em><em> </em></p><p>username map cache time (G)</p><p>Mapping usernames with the \m[blue]<strong>username map</strong>\m[] or \m[blue]<strong>username map script</strong>\m[] features of Samba can be relatively expensive. During login of a user, the mapping is done several times. In particular, calling the \m[blue]<strong>username map script</strong>\m[] can slow down logins if external databases have to be queried from the script being called.</p><p>The parameter \m[blue]<strong>username map cache time</strong>\m[] controls a mapping cache. It specifies the number of seconds a mapping from the username map file or script is to be efficiently cached. The default of 0 means no caching is done.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>username map cache time</em><em> = </em><em>0</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>username map cache time</em><em> = </em><em>60</em><em> </em></p><p>username map script (G)</p><p>This script is a mutually exclusive alternative to the \m[blue]<strong>username map</strong>\m[] parameter. This parameter specifies and external program or script that must accept a single command line option (the username transmitted in the authentication request) and return a line on standard output (the name to which the account should mapped). In this way, it is possible to store username map tables in an LDAP or NIS directory services.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>username map script</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>username map script</em><em> = </em><em>/etc/samba/scripts/mapusers.sh</em><em> </em></p><p>username map (G)</p><p>This option allows you to specify a file containing a mapping of usernames from the clients to the server. This can be used for several purposes. The most common is to map usernames that users use on DOS or Windows machines to those that the UNIX box uses. The other is to map multiple users to a single username so that they can more easily share files.</p><p>Please note that for user mode security, the username map is applied prior to validating the user credentials. Domain member servers (domain or ads) apply the username map after the user has been successfully authenticated by the domain controller and require fully qualified entries in the map table (e.g. biddle = DOMAIN&#92;foo).</p><p>The map file is parsed line by line. Each line should contain a single UNIX username on the left then a &apos;=&apos; followed by a list of usernames on the right. The list of usernames on the right may contain names of the form @group in which case they will match any UNIX username in that group. The special client name &apos;*&apos; is a wildcard and matches any name. Each line of the map file may be up to 1023 characters long.</p><p>The file is processed on each line by taking the supplied username and comparing it with each username on the right hand side of the &apos;=&apos; signs. If the supplied name matches any of the names on the right hand side then it is replaced with the name on the left. Processing then continues with the next line.</p><p>If any line begins with a &apos;#&apos; or a &apos;;&apos; then it is ignored.</p><p>If any line begins with an &apos;!&apos; then the processing will stop after that line if a mapping was done by the line. Otherwise mapping continues with every line being processed. Using &apos;!&apos; is most useful when you have a wildcard mapping line later in the file.</p><p>For example to map from the name <strong>admin</strong> or <strong>administrator</strong> to the UNIX name <strong> root</strong> you would use:</p>
<pre>
root = admin administrator
</pre>
<p>Or to map anyone in the UNIX group <strong>system</strong> to the UNIX name <strong>sys</strong> you would use:</p>
<pre>
sys = @system
</pre>
<p>You can have as many mappings as you like in a username map file.</p><p>If your system supports the NIS NETGROUP option then the netgroup database is checked before the /etc/group database for matching groups.</p><p>You can map Windows usernames that have spaces in them by using double quotes around the name. For example:</p>
<pre>
tridge = "Andrew Tridgell"
</pre>
<p>would map the windows username "Andrew Tridgell" to the unix username "tridge".</p><p>The following example would map mary and fred to the unix user sys, and map the rest to guest. Note the use of the &apos;!&apos; to tell Samba to stop processing if it gets a match on that line:</p>
<pre>
!sys = mary fred

<p>Note that the remapping is applied to all occurrences of usernames. Thus if you connect to &#92;&#92;server&#92;fred and <strong>fred</strong> is remapped to <strong>mary</strong> then you will actually be connecting to &#92;&#92;server&#92;mary and will need to supply a password suitable for <strong>mary</strong> not <strong>fred</strong>. The only exception to this is the username passed to a Domain Controller (if you have one). The DC will receive whatever username the client supplies without modification.</p><p>Also note that no reverse mapping is done. The main effect this has is with printing. Users who have been mapped may have trouble deleting print jobs as PrintManager under WfWg will think they don&apos;t own the print job.</p><p>Samba versions prior to 3.0.8 would only support reading the fully qualified username (e.g.: DOMAIN&#92;user) from the username map when performing a kerberos login from a client. However, when looking up a map entry for a user authenticated by NTLM[SSP], only the login name would be used for matches. This resulted in inconsistent behavior sometimes even on the same server.</p><p>The following functionality is obeyed in version 3.0.8 and later:</p><p>When performing local authentication, the username map is applied to the login name before attempting to authenticate the connection.</p><p>When relying upon a external domain controller for validating authentication requests, smbd will apply the username map to the fully qualified username (i.e. DOMAIN&#92;user) only after the user has been successfully authenticated.</p><p>An example of use is:</p>

It is the equivalent of allowing people who can create a share the option of setting <em>guest ok = yes</em> in a share definition. Due to its security sensitive nature, the default is set to off.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>usershare allow guests</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>usershare max shares (G)</p><p>This parameter specifies the number of user defined shares that are allowed to be created by users belonging to the group owning the usershare directory. If set to zero (the default) user defined shares are ignored.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>usershare max shares</em><em> = </em><em>0</em><em> </em></p><p>usershare owner only (G)</p><p>This parameter controls whether the pathname exported by a user defined shares must be owned by the user creating the user defined share or not. If set to True (the default) then smbd checks that the directory path being shared is owned by the user who owns the usershare file defining this share and refuses to create the share if not. If set to False then no such check is performed and any directory path may be exported regardless of who owns it.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>usershare owner only</em><em> = </em><em>True</em><em> </em></p><p>usershare path (G)</p><p>This parameter specifies the absolute path of the directory on the filesystem used to store the user defined share definition files. This directory must be owned by root, and have no access for other, and be writable only by the group owner. In addition the "sticky" bit must also be set, restricting rename and delete to owners of a file (in the same way the /tmp directory is usually configured). Members of the group owner of this directory are the users allowed to create usershares.</p><p>For example, a valid usershare directory might be /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares, set up as follows.</p>
<pre>
	ls -ld /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares/

If the pathname to be exported doesn&apos;t start with one of the strings in this list, the user defined share will not be allowed. This allows the Samba administrator to restrict the directories on the system that can be exported by user defined shares.</p><p>If there is a "usershare prefix deny list" and also a "usershare prefix allow list" the deny list is processed first, followed by the allow list, thus leading to the most restrictive interpretation.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>usershare prefix allow list</em><em> = </em><em>NULL</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>usershare prefix allow list</em><em> = </em><em>/home /data /space</em><em> </em></p><p>usershare prefix deny list (G)</p><p>This parameter specifies a list of absolute pathnames the root of which are NOT allowed to be exported by user defined share definitions. If the pathname exported starts with one of the strings in this list the user defined share will not be allowed. Any pathname not starting with one of these strings will be allowed to be exported as a usershare. This allows the Samba administrator to restrict the directories on the system that can be exported by user defined shares.</p><p>If there is a "usershare prefix deny list" and also a "usershare prefix allow list" the deny list is processed first, followed by the allow list, thus leading to the most restrictive interpretation.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>usershare prefix deny list</em><em> = </em><em>NULL</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>usershare prefix deny list</em><em> = </em><em>/etc /dev /private</em><em> </em></p><p>usershare template share (G)</p><p>User defined shares only have limited possible parameters such as path, guest ok, etc. This parameter allows usershares to "cloned" from an existing share. If "usershare template share" is set to the name of an existing share, then all usershares created have their defaults set from the parameters set on this share.</p><p>The target share may be set to be invalid for real file sharing by setting the parameter "-valid = False" on the template share definition. This causes it not to be seen as a real exported share but to be able to be used as a template for usershares.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>usershare template share</em><em> = </em><em>NULL</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>usershare template share</em><em> = </em><em>template_share</em><em> </em></p><p>use sendfile (S)</p><p>If this parameter is <strong>yes</strong>, and the <strong>sendfile()</strong> system call is supported by the underlying operating system, then some SMB read calls (mainly ReadAndX and ReadRaw) will use the more efficient sendfile system call for files that are exclusively oplocked. This may make more efficient use of the system CPU&apos;s and cause Samba to be faster. Samba automatically turns this off for clients that use protocol levels lower than NT LM 0.12 and when it detects a client is Windows 9x (using sendfile from Linux will cause these clients to fail).</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>use sendfile</em><em> = </em><em>false</em><em> </em></p><p>use spnego (G)</p><p>This deprecated variable controls whether samba will try to use Simple and Protected NEGOciation (as specified by rfc2478) with WindowsXP and Windows2000 clients to agree upon an authentication mechanism.</p><p>Unless further issues are discovered with our SPNEGO implementation, there is no reason this should ever be disabled.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>use spnego</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>utmp directory (G)</p><p>This parameter is only available if Samba has been configured and compiled with the option --with-utmp. It specifies a directory pathname that is used to store the utmp or utmpx files (depending on the UNIX system) that record user connections to a Samba server. By default this is not set, meaning the system will use whatever utmp file the native system is set to use (usually /var/run/utmp on Linux).</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>utmp directory</em><em> = </em><em> # Determined automatically</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>utmp directory</em><em> = </em><em>/var/run/utmp</em><em> </em></p><p>utmp (G)</p><p>This boolean parameter is only available if Samba has been configured and compiled with the option --with-utmp. If set to <strong>yes</strong> then Samba will attempt to add utmp or utmpx records (depending on the UNIX system) whenever a connection is made to a Samba server. Sites may use this to record the user connecting to a Samba share.</p><p>Due to the requirements of the utmp record, we are required to create a unique identifier for the incoming user. Enabling this option creates an n^2 algorithm to find this number. This may impede performance on large installations.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>utmp</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>valid users (S)</p><p>This is a list of users that should be allowed to login to this service. Names starting with &apos;@&apos;, &apos;+&apos; and &apos;&&apos; are interpreted using the same rules as described in the <em>invalid users</em> parameter.</p><p>If this is empty (the default) then any user can login. If a username is in both this list and the <em>invalid users</em> list then access is denied for that user.</p><p>The current servicename is substituted for <em>%S</em>. This is useful in the [homes] section.</p><p><em>Note: </em>When used in the [global] section this parameter may have unwanted side effects. For example: If samba is configured as a MASTER BROWSER (see <em>local master</em>, <em>os level</em>, <em>domain master</em>, <em>preferred master</em>) this option will prevent workstations from being able to browse the network.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>valid users</em><em> = </em><em> # No valid users list (anyone can login) </em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>valid users</em><em> = </em><em>greg, @pcusers</em><em> </em></p><p>-valid (S)</p><p>This parameter indicates whether a share is valid and thus can be used. When this parameter is set to false, the share will be in no way visible nor accessible.</p><p>This option should not be used by regular users but might be of help to developers. Samba uses this option internally to mark shares as deleted.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>-valid</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>veto files (S)</p><p>This is a list of files and directories that are neither visible nor accessible. Each entry in the list must be separated by a &apos;/&apos;, which allows spaces to be included in the entry. &apos;*&apos; and &apos;?&apos; can be used to specify multiple files or directories as in DOS wildcards.</p><p>Each entry must be a unix path, not a DOS path and must <em>not</em> include the unix directory separator &apos;/&apos;.</p><p>Note that the \m[blue]<strong>case sensitive</strong>\m[] option is applicable in vetoing files.</p><p>One feature of the veto files parameter that it is important to be aware of is Samba&apos;s behaviour when trying to delete a directory. If a directory that is to be deleted contains nothing but veto files this deletion will <em>fail</em> unless you also set the \m[blue]<strong>delete veto files</strong>\m[] parameter to <em>yes</em>.</p><p>Setting this parameter will affect the performance of Samba, as it will be forced to check all files and directories for a match as they are scanned.</p><p>Examples of use include:</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>Default: <em></em><em>veto files</em><em> = </em><em>No files or directories are vetoed.</em><em> </em></p><p>veto oplock files (S)</p><p>This parameter is only valid when the \m[blue]<strong>oplocks</strong>\m[] parameter is turned on for a share. It allows the Samba administrator to selectively turn off the granting of oplocks on selected files that match a wildcarded list, similar to the wildcarded list used in the \m[blue]<strong>veto files</strong>\m[] parameter.</p><p>You might want to do this on files that you know will be heavily contended for by clients. A good example of this is in the NetBench SMB benchmark program, which causes heavy client contention for files ending in .SEM. To cause Samba not to grant oplocks on these files you would use the line (either in the [global] section or in the section for the particular NetBench share.</p><p>An example of use is:</p>

Links that point to areas within the directory tree exported by the server are always allowed; this parameter controls access only to areas that are outside the directory tree being exported.</p><p>Note: Turning this parameter on when UNIX extensions are enabled will allow UNIX clients to create symbolic links on the share that can point to files or directories outside restricted path exported by the share definition. This can cause access to areas outside of the share.

Nested groups are also called local groups or aliases. They work like their counterparts in Windows: Nested groups are defined locally on any machine (they are shared between DC&apos;s through their SAM) and can contain users and global groups from any trusted SAM. To be able to use nested groups, you need to run nss_winbind.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>winbind nested groups</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>winbind normalize names (G)</p><p>This parameter controls whether winbindd will replace whitespace in user and group names with an underscore (_) character. For example, whether the name "Space Kadet" should be replaced with the string "space_kadet". Frequently Unix shell scripts will have difficulty with usernames contains whitespace due to the default field separator in the shell. If your domain possesses names containing the underscore character, this option may cause problems unless the name aliasing feature is supported by your nss_info plugin.</p><p>This feature also enables the name aliasing API which can be used to make domain user and group names to a non-qualified version. Please refer to the manpage for the configured idmap and nss_info plugin for the specifics on how to configure name aliasing for a specific configuration. Name aliasing takes precedence (and is mutually exclusive) over the whitespace replacement mechanism discussed previously.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>winbind normalize names</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>winbind normalize names</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>winbind nss info (G)</p><p>This parameter is designed to control how Winbind retrieves Name Service Information to construct a user&apos;s home directory and login shell.

For SFU 3.0 or 3.5 simply choose "sfu", if you use SFU 2.0 please choose "sfu20". Note that retrieving UID and GID from your ADS-Server requires to use <em>idmap config DOMAIN:backend</em> = ad as well.

Note that this parameter also controls the Domain name used with the \m[blue]<strong>security = domain</strong>\m[] setting.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>workgroup</em><em> = </em><em>WORKGROUP</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>workgroup</em><em> = </em><em>MYGROUP</em><em> </em></p><p>writable</p><p>This parameter is a synonym for writeable.</p><p>writeable (S)</p><p>Inverted synonym for \m[blue]<strong>read only</strong>\m[].</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>writeable</em><em> = </em><em>no</em><em> </em></p><p>write cache size (S)</p><p>If this integer parameter is set to non-zero value, Samba will create an in-memory cache for each oplocked file (it does <em>not</em> do this for non-oplocked files). All writes that the client does not request to be flushed directly to disk will be stored in this cache if possible. The cache is flushed onto disk when a write comes in whose offset would not fit into the cache or when the file is closed by the client. Reads for the file are also served from this cache if the data is stored within it.</p><p>This cache allows Samba to batch client writes into a more efficient write size for RAID disks (i.e. writes may be tuned to be the RAID stripe size) and can improve performance on systems where the disk subsystem is a bottleneck but there is free memory for userspace programs.</p><p>The integer parameter specifies the size of this cache (per oplocked file) in bytes.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>write cache size</em><em> = </em><em>0</em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>write cache size</em><em> = </em><em>262144 # for a 256k cache size per file</em><em> </em></p><p>write list (S)</p><p>This is a list of users that are given read-write access to a service. If the connecting user is in this list then they will be given write access, no matter what the \m[blue]<strong>read only</strong>\m[] option is set to. The list can include group names using the @group syntax.</p><p>Note that if a user is in both the read list and the write list then they will be given write access.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>write list</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>write list</em><em> = </em><em>admin, root, @staff</em><em> </em></p><p>write raw (G)</p><p>This parameter controls whether or not the server will support raw write SMB&apos;s when transferring data from clients. You should never need to change this parameter.</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>write raw</em><em> = </em><em>yes</em><em> </em></p><p>wtmp directory (G)</p><p>This parameter is only available if Samba has been configured and compiled with the option --with-utmp. It specifies a directory pathname that is used to store the wtmp or wtmpx files (depending on the UNIX system) that record user connections to a Samba server. The difference with the utmp directory is the fact that user info is kept after a user has logged out.</p><p>By default this is not set, meaning the system will use whatever utmp file the native system is set to use (usually /var/run/wtmp on Linux).</p><p>Default: <em></em><em>wtmp directory</em><em> = </em><em></em><em> </em></p><p>Example: <em></em><em>wtmp directory</em><em> = </em><em>/var/log/wtmp</em><em> </em></p>

<p>Although the configuration file permits service names to contain spaces, your client software may not. Spaces will be ignored in comparisons anyway, so it shouldn&apos;t be a problem - but be aware of the possibility.</p><p>On a similar note, many clients - especially DOS clients - limit service names to eight characters. <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong>(8)</a> has no such limitation, but attempts to connect from such clients will fail if they truncate the service names. For this reason you should probably keep your service names down to eight characters in length.</p><p>Use of the [homes] and [printers] special sections make life for an administrator easy, but the various combinations of default attributes can be tricky. Take extreme care when designing these sections. In particular, ensure that the permissions on spool directories are correct.</p>

<p>The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.</p><p>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.</p>
