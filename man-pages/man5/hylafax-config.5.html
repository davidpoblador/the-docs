        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>\*(Fx uses a configuration file for the central queueing agent and for each facsimile modem attached to a machine. These files contain information about the modems and about how the \*(Fx server processes that service these modem should operate. Configuration files are located in the <strong>etc</strong> subdirectory. The configuration file for the <a href="../man8/faxq.8.html"><strong>faxq</strong>(8)</a> program is named <strong>config</strong>. The per-modem configuration files used by the <a href="../man8/faxgetty.8.html"><strong>faxgetty</strong>(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/faxsend.8.html"><strong>faxsend</strong>(8)</a>, and <a href="../man8/pagesend.8.html"><strong>pagesend</strong>(8)</a> programs have names of the form <strong>config.</strong><em>devid</em><strong>,</strong> where <em>devid</em> is an identifier derived from the name of the modem's device file; for example <em>ttym2</em> for <em>/dev/ttym2</em>, <em>term_10</em> for <em>/dev/term/10</em>.</p><p>Configuration files have a simple format and are entirely <small>ASCII.</small> A configuration parameter is of the form</p><p><strong>tag</strong>: <em>value</em></p><p>where a <em>tag</em> identifies a parameter and a <em>value</em> is either a string, number, or boolean value. Comments are introduced by the ``#'' character and extend to the end of the line. String values start at the first non-blank character after the ``:'' and continue to the first non-whitespace character or, if whitespace is to be included, may be enclosed in quote marks (``"''). String values enclosed in quote marks may also use the standard C programming conventions for specifying escape codes; e.g. ``&#92;n'' for a newline character and ``&#92;xxx'' for an octal value. Numeric values are specified according to the C programming conventions (leading ``0x'' for hex, leading ``0'' for octal, otherwise decimal), except for a few parameters, such as <strong>RecvFileMode</strong>, whose value is interpreted strictly as an octal number and <strong>PageChopThreshold</strong> whose value is interpreted strictly as a floating point number. Boolean values are case insensitive. For a true value, either ``Yes'' or ``On'' should be used. For a false value, use ``No'' or ``Off''.</p><p>The following table itemizes the tags and the expected type of their value. The first part lists items specific to the operation of each server, while the second part has items related to the servicing of the modem. Parameters marked with a \(S1 are used only by the \*(Fx scheduler process and should appear only in the file named <strong>config</strong>. Parameters marked with a \(S2 are used by both the scheduler and the per-device applications and so should appear in all appropriate configuration files (i.e. <strong>config</strong> and any per-device files that make sense). Parameters not otherwise marked should appear only in per-device configuration files. More detailed information about each item is given following the table.</p>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>These configuration parameters affect the general operation of the fax server.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AdaptiveAnswer</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Control whether or not an adaptive answering strategy is used whereby an incoming call is answered in multiple ways according to the list specified in the <strong>AnswerRotary</strong> parameter. For example, if adaptive answering is enabled and <strong>AnswerRotary</strong> specifies ``fax data'', then an incoming call will first be answered as fax using <strong>ModemAnswerFaxCmd</strong> and then, if that fails, as data using <strong>ModemAnswerDataCmd</strong>. If the adaptive answer strategy is not enabled, then calls are answered using the appropriate <strong>ModemAnswer*Cmd</strong> parameter (normally <strong>ModemAnswerCmd</strong> for unattended operation). Note that the adaptive answer strategy depends on many factors that limit its usefulness. When calls are answered first as fax, it typically only works with a Class 1 modem because it is important that the sequence of operations related to answering as fax be completed in a short enough time that a subsequent answer for data be done before the caller times out and hangs up the telephone (for this reason <strong>Class1RecvIdentTimer</strong> should be set to a value that is shorter than <strong>FaxT1Timer</strong>.) Also, note that it is sometimes necessary to arrange that the phone be placed on-hook between successive answers; this can typically be done by inserting the appropriate command at the start of the second and subsequent <strong>ModemAnswer*Cmd</strong>s.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AdminGroup</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Tells PAM what user group is allowed to administer the fax server. Only useful if the server is compiled with PAM enabled.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AnswerRotary</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The sequence of answering techniques the server should ``rotate through'' when answer incoming calls. Answering techniques are:</p>
<pre>
<strong>Name	Description</strong>
fax	answer a fax call
data	answer a data call
voice	answer a voice call
extern	use the <em>vgetty</em> application to answer a call
any	answer a call of any/unknown type
</pre>
<p>When a call is not answered successfully, the server advances the rotary to the next specified answering technique. If <strong>AdaptiveAnswer</strong> is enabled, the server will try all the answering techniques for each incoming call. Otherwise, the rotary is advanced <em>between</em> unsuccessful phone calls. For example, if <strong>AdaptiveAnswer</strong> is disabled and <strong>AnswerRotary</strong> is ``fax data'', then the calls will initially be answered as fax until the first call is received that does not appear to be from a fax machine; after that calls will be answered as if they were from a data modem until the next unsuccessful call; after which they will one again be answered as fax. Only the first three techniques listed are used; any additional ones are (silently) ignored. See also <strong>AnswerBias</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AnswerBias</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The index into the <strong>AnswerRotary</strong> list that the server should rotate the list to after each successful incoming phone call. List indices are numbered starting at zero. For example, if <strong>AnswerRotary</strong> is ``fax data'' and <strong>AnswerBias</strong> is 1, then after each successful inbound call, the next call will be answered as data.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AreaCode\(S2</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The local area code in which the facsimile modem resides. This value is passed to the dial string rules that are used, for example, to formulate canonical phone numbers for dialing (see <strong>DialStringRules</strong> below.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>AuditHook\(S1</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies a program command and an interest specification indicating which events as described in <a href="../man8/faxwatch.8.html"><strong>faxwatch</strong>(8)</a> should trigger the execution of the program.  For example, this configuration:</p>
<pre>
    AuditHook: "bin/hook: J*S*M*R*"

</pre>
<p>would cause bin/hook to be executed upon every event.  The arguments passed to the hook program are respectively <em>&lt;class&gt;</em>, <em>&lt;mask&gt;</em>, <em>&lt;id&gt;</em>, and optionally <em>[info]</em> where...</p>
<pre>
    &lt;class&gt; = JOB | SEND | MODEM | RECV
    &lt;mask&gt;  = the specific event
    &lt;id&gt;    = id of the job/modem with which the event is associated
    [info]  = additional information

</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>BadPageHandlingMethod</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(Class 1/1.0 only) Specifies how to react to a bad page received from the remote sender: one of ``\s-1RTN\s+1'', ``\s-1DCN\s+1'', or ``\s-1RTN-SAVE\s+1''.</p><p>If a page is received in non-ECM mode with unacceptable quality according to <strong>PercentGoodLines</strong> or <strong>MaxConseutiveBadLines</strong> then it can be somewhat difficult to inform the sender of the problem. Historically, \*(Fx has assumed that signalling RTN to the sender will accomplish this.  However, some senders are incapable of retransmitting pages, and to reduce burden they treat an RTN signal as a receipt confirmation and proceed to the next page without notifying the sending user of the potential problem in readability on the receive-end.  (The assumption there being that the receiving user will notify the sending user if there actually is a readability problem.)</p><p>A setting of ``\s-1RTN\s+1'' is the historic behavior and assumes that an RTN signal will be enough to get the sender to retransmit or be otherwise informed of a potential readability problem on the receive-end. The previously-received page data is marked to be overwritten by the next page data received from the sender.</p><p>A setting of ``\s-1DCN\s+1'' tells \*(Fx to transmit a DCN signal in response to the post-page message and should trigger a call abortion by the sender.  This should clearly indicate a problem in page readability to the sender, although the receipt of any following pages in a later call cannot be guaranteed.</p><p>A setting of ``\s-1RTN-SAVE\s+1'' more closely approximates the behavior of other fax receivers (especially fax machines).  It causes \*(Fx to send the RTN signal but it saves the previously received page data and places the next transmitted page data in another page.  This is the default setting.  However, this could result in multiple copies of the same page image being saved in the same file - if the sender does indeed retransmit the unacceptable pages during the same call.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>BatchLogs\(S1</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When sending or receiving multiple documents (denoted by EOM), this value determines if the session logs span the entire batch or, if set to no, only contain a single document.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>CallIDPattern</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A string that identifies the caller's identity in any call identification messages provided by the modem (such as Caller*ID or DNIS/DID). The specified string is compared against any unrecognized status messages received from the modem before <strong>ModemAnswerCmd</strong> is sent to the modem. If there is a match, then the remainder of the message is returned as <strong>CallIDn</strong> where n corresponds to the n'th instance that this <strong>CallIDPattern</strong> is from the top in the modem configuration file. For example, for the ZyXEL U-1496 this parameter would be set to</p>
<pre>
\s-1CallIDPattern: ``CALLER NAME: ''\s+1 (note the trailing space).
</pre>
<p>If more than one message matches between instances of "RING" messages, then the message remainders are concatenated.</p><p>The special <strong>CallID</strong> value of "SHIELDED_DTMF" is used in conjunction with <strong>ModemRingResponse</strong> and <strong>CallIDAnswerLength.</strong> After executing <strong>ModemRingResponse,</strong> HylaFAX will expect DTMF data (usually DLE-shielded) for <strong>CallIDn</strong> until <strong>CallIDAnswerLength</strong> is reached.  Note that if the modem is in voice mode to hear these DTMF digits, then it must be returned to fax mode in the <strong>ModemAnswerCmd.</strong> In order to prevent this feature from losing incoming fax calls, if fax sender CNG is detected while waiting for DTMF or if ten seconds elapse without sufficient DTMF then the remaining expected digits will be populated by whitespace, triggering fax answering.</p><p>For example, the following settings will cause HylaFAX to enter voice mode and go off-hook when a RING is detected.  It will then expect four DTMF digits (presumably for routing), and then it will pause for 100 ms before returning to fax mode and answering the call.</p>
<pre>
  ModemRingResponse:     AT+FCLASS=8;H1
  CallIDPattern:         SHIELDED_DTMF
  CallIDAnswerLength:    4
  ModemAnswerCmd:        &lt;delay:100&gt;AT+FCLASS=1;A

</pre>
<p>For modems that do not support AT+FCLASS=8 (such as some USR modems) this may be an appropriate equivalent:</p>
<pre>
  ModemRingResponse:      "AT#CLS=8&#92;nAT#VLS=4&#92;nATA"
  CallIDPattern:          SHIELDED_DTMF
  CallIDAnswerLength:     4
  ModemAnswerCmd:         "&lt;delay:100&gt;AT+FCLASS=1&#92;nATA"

</pre>
<p>Multiple entries of <strong>CallIDPattern</strong> are used together in one modem configuration file in order to capture multiple <strong>CallID</strong> responses.  For example, the following settings would capture "NDID" responses from the modem as CallID1, "NMBR" responses from the modem as CallID2, "NAME" responses as CallID3, and it would trigger <strong>ModemAnswerCmd</strong> whenever CallID1 or CallID2 were longer than 7 or 10 characters, respectively.</p>
<pre>
  CallIDPattern:         "NDID="
  CallIDAnswerLength:    7
  CallIDPattern:         "NMBR="
  CallIDAnswerLength:    10
  CallIDPattern:         "NAME="

</pre>
<p>Note that this example is only given as an example, and probably would cause unexpected results.  Because pattern-matching ends when <strong>ModemAnswerCmd</strong> is sent to the modem, if "NDID", "NMBR", and "NAME" responses came from the modem in that order, and the "NDID" response was at least 7 characters long, then <strong>ModemAnswerCmd</strong> would be sent to the modem immediately following the "NDID" response, and the "NMBR" and "NAME" responses would be ignored.  Generally only one <strong>CallIDAnswerLength</strong> item should be in a modem configuration file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>CallIDAnswerLength</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>An integer indicating the minimum number of characters in a <strong>CallID</strong> matching the previous <strong>CallIDPattern</strong> to be received when <strong>ModemAnswerCmd</strong> is sent to the modem irrespective of any <strong>RingsBeforeAnswer</strong> value greater than zero.  This allows the answering of calls which deliver CID/DID data but not RINGs. For example,</p>
<pre>
\s-1CallIDAnswerLength: ``7''\s+1
</pre>
<p>would cause the call to be answered when <strong>CallID2</strong> reached a length of seven digits. A value of zero for <strong>CallIDAnswerLength</strong> disables this feature.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ClocalAsRoot</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Control whether operations that set the <small>CLOCAL</small> bit on the modem device special file are done with the effective user-ID set to the super-user or the ``fax'' user. By default such operations are done as the fax user, except under <small>IRIX</small> where they are done as the super-user (because <small>IRIX</small> disallows manipulation of <small>CLOCAL</small> by anyone but the super-user).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ContCoverCmd\(S1</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to invoke to generate a continuation cover page; see <strong>ContCoverPage</strong> and <a href="../man8/mkcover.8.html"><strong>mkcover</strong>(8)</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ContCoverPage\(S1</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A template file to use in creating <em>continuation cover pages</em>. If this parameter is non-null, then the server will pass the filename to the command specified by <strong>ContCoverCmd</strong> to generate cover pages for outbound jobs that are continued after protocol errors. These cover pages identify the receiver and indicate that the document is a continued transmission. If this parameter is not specified or is null, then the server will not generate continuation cover pages. The specified pathname must be relative to the top of the fax server's spooling area.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>CountryCode\(S2</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The local country code in which the facsimile modem resides. As for <strong>AreaCode</strong>, this value is passed to the dial string rules for use in formulating canonical phone numbers for dialing (among other things.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>CountSkippedPages</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If a page range has been specified in the job, and pages are being skipped during the send, this controls if the pages skipped are counted in the pages counted and totaled.  If skipped pages are to be counted, it will appear as if the pages were instantly sent in 0:00 with no data.  The tagline counts will be incremented on skipped pages, and faxq will notify clients via triggers of them as well.  If the are not to be counted, then tagline page counts will act as if the pages never existed, and not faxq trigger notifications will be sent.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>DeviceMode</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The file protection mode that the server should set for the modem device file. Note that this value is given in octal. The default value of 0600 implies that only the facsimile user (usually <em>uucp</em>) can access the modem. See also <a href="../man2/chmod.2.html"><strong>chmod</strong>(2)</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>DialStringRules\(S2</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The pathname of the file that holds the rules for processing user-specified dial strings; c.f. <a href="../man5/dialrules.5.html"><strong>dialrules</strong>(5)</a>. The specified pathname must be relative to the top of the fax server's spooling area; e.g. <strong>etc/dialrules</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>DistinctiveRings</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Modern distinctive ring support on most modems indicates the ring cadence rather than the older style of ``RING1'', ``RING2'', etc.  To indicate the ring cadence, <strong>DRingOn</strong> and <strong>DRingOff</strong> values are presented by the modem to the <em>faxgetty</em> process.  The modem indicates the entire cadence between ``RING'' indications Like this:</p>
<pre>
  RING
  DROF=40
  DRON=8
  DROF=4
  DRON=8
  RING

</pre>
<p>The corresponding <strong>DistinctiveRings</strong> parameter for this ring cadence would be:</p>
<pre>
  DistinctiveRings:  F-8-4-8

</pre>
<p>where ``F'' tells the <em>faxgetty</em> process that the ring cadence is for a facsimile (``V'' for voice and ``D'' for data), and the other values describe the ring cadence with leading and ending <strong>DRingOff</strong> values ignored.  Multiple ring cadences are indicated by delimiting them with commas in this fashion:</p>
<pre>
  DistinctiveRings:  V-20,F-8-4-8,D-4-2-4-8

</pre>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>DRingOff</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A string that identifies the ``off'' value in any distinctive ring cadence, for example ``\s-1DROF=\s+1''. See also <strong>DRingOn</strong> and <strong>DistinctiveRings</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>DRingOn</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A string that identifies the ``on'' value in any distinctive ring cadence, for example ``\s-1DRON=\s+1''. See also <strong>DRingOff</strong> and <strong>DistinctiveRings</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>DynamicConfig</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The pathname of the optional program, e.g. ``etc/localid'', that makes dynamic configuration changes, i.e., to <strong>LocalIdentifier,</strong> based on device ID and call identification.  The program is passed those values as the parameters ($1 = device id, $2 = CallID1, $3 = CallID2, $4 = CallID3, ...), when answering an incoming call.  The program can then perform local processing as desired to send on standard output the configuration items to change in a ``parameter:value'' format, i.e. ``LocalIdentifier: +1.800.555.1212''.  If there are multiple parameters to be changed, then each item must be on its own line. This is commonly used to dynamically alter the local identification of systems which use DID/DNIS, but it can also be used to allow different modem configurations for different senders.  This program can also set the <strong>RejectCall</strong> options to cause the current call to be rejected instead of answered. Note that this file must be marked as executable by the faxgetty process.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>EGettyArgs</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A string that indicates whether or not the server should use an an external getty application to deduce and possibly handle an incoming call. If the string value is not null, then it is interpreted as a set of arguments to pass to the getty program. Before supplying the arguments, the string is first scanned for ``%''-escape sequences: any appearance of ``%l'' is replaced with the tty name and any appearance of ``%s'' is replaced with the serial port speed (in decimal). Any appearance of escaped numbers 1 through 9 (``%1'' through ``%9'') are replaced by the match to the corresponding <strong>CallIDPattern</strong>, if present. The ``%'' character can be specified with ``%%''. If the <strong>EGettyArgs</strong> parameter is not specified in the configuration file or if the string value is null, then ``extern'' connections will be rejected. Note that in addition to the specified command line arguments, the external getty program is invoked with its standard input, output, and error descriptors directed to the controlling tty device.</p><p>When the external getty application completes, its exit status is evaluated and is interpreted to indicate what, if anything, should be done with the call. An exit status of ``0'' indicates an unknown call type and that the call should be handled as if the external getty program had not been used.  An exit status of ``1'' indicates a data connection and that the <a href="../man8/getty.8.html"><strong>getty</strong>(8)</a> program should be used to handle the call (see <strong>GettyArgs</strong>) after being answered with <strong>ModemAnswerDataBeginCmd .</strong> An exit status of ``2'' indicates a fax connection that should be handled after being answered with <strong>ModemAnswerFaxBeginCmd</strong>. An exit status of ``3'' indicates a voice call and that the <em>vgetty</em> program should be used to handle the call (see <strong>VGettyArgs</strong>) after being answered with BR ModemAnswerVoiceBeginCmd . An exit status of ``4'' is considered to be an error condition.  The session will be terminated.  An exit status of ``5'' is used to indicate that the external getty program handled the call entirely, is not an error condition, and that the session is to be considered terminated.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The number of times to redial a phone number after the dialing attempt failed because of NO CARRIER when the number has not been successfully dialed before. In normal operation the fax server will treat this result code to mean that a facsimile modem/machine did not answer the phone and reject the transmit job. This is done to avoid repeatedly dialing wrong phone numbers and depends on the modem distinguishing between no carrier and no answer. However, some modems are not capable of reliably distinguishing between no carrier and no answer, or when instructed to do so do not identify a busy signal correctly. For these modems one may find it necessary to increase the value of this parameter to compensate. It is strongly recommended, however, that this value not be set to a large number.</p>

    <p>A string that indicates whether or not the server should invoke the <a href="../man8/getty.8.html"><strong>getty</strong>(8)</a> program in response to an incoming call from a data modem. If the string value is not null, then it is interpreted as a set of arguments to pass to the getty program. Before supplying the arguments, the string is first scanned for ``%''-escape sequences: any appearance of ``%l'' is replaced with the tty name and any appearance of ``%s'' is replaced with the serial port speed (in decimal). Any appearance of escaped numbers 1 through 9 (``%1'' through ``%9'') are replaced by the match to the corresponding <strong>CallIDPattern</strong>, if present. The ``%'' character can be specified with ``%%''. If the <strong>GettyArgs</strong> parameter is not specified in the configuration file or if the string value is null, then data connections will be rejected. Note that in addition to the specified command line arguments, the <em>getty</em> program is invoked with its standard input, output, and error descriptors directed to the controlling tty device.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>The local station identification string to use when transmitting <small>TSI</small> and <small>CSI</small> strings (see <strong>FAXNumber</strong> above). NB: while this string may contain any printable <small>ASCII</small> characters; beware that <small>CCITT T.30</small> specifies a restricted character set and some fax modems and machines may reject or not display  non-conforming strings. If the local identifier is not specified, a canonical form of the <strong>FAXNumber</strong> is used instead.</p>

    <p><strong>LockDataCalls</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Hold the <small>UUCP</small> lockfile during the time an inbound data call is processed by the external getty program. If this is disabled then the lockfile will be removed just before the getty program is invoked.

    <p><strong>LockVoiceCalls</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Hold the <small>UUCP</small> lockfile during the time an inbound data call is processed by the external voice getty program. If this is disabled then the lockfile will be removed just before the voice getty program is invoked. Note however that doing this introduces a race condition whereby an outbound program may sneak in and take control of the modem after the inbound call has been accepted, but before the voice getty program has started up and installed it's own lockfile.</p>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The file protection mode that should be used when creating files to hold session logs. Note that this value is given in octal. The default value of 0600 implies that the log files are not generally accessible, which is important if sensitive information such as calling card access codes are logged. If log files are to be publicly accessible, this value may be set, for example, to 0644. See also <a href="../man2/chmod.2.html"><strong>chmod</strong>(2)</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>MaxConcurrentCalls\(S1</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The default value to use for the maximum number of jobs for the same destination that are processed concurrently. Thus this parameter defines the maximum number of concurrent phone calls to the same destination. Unless all of your fax destinations have multiple fax lines using the same fax number per destination then <strong>MaxConcurrentCalls</strong> is probably best left as the default of 1 and exceptions should be accommodated by the <strong>JobControl</strong> mechanism.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>MaxTries\(S1</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The default value for the maximum number of times the server will attempt to communicate with a remote site. Note that for a call to be counted against this limit, carrier must be established; this is in contrast to the value of <strong>MaxDials</strong> which limits the number of calls that will be placed on behalf of a job. This value may be overridden by rules in the <strong>JobControl</strong> mechanism. See also <strong>MaxDials</strong>.</p>

Thus for example, the default modem to use for a job, <strong>any</strong>, is defined as ``any:.*''. This parameter may be specified multiple times to define multiple modem classes. Modem classes may overlap. The actual set of modems in a modem class that are considered for use may vary based on which modems are believed to be ready for use.</p>

    <p><strong>ModemPriority</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The scheduling priority to use for a modem. Priority values are in the range 0 to 255 with lesser values signifying higher (more desirable) priority. The \*(Fx scheduler process assigns the highest priority modem that is ready for use when scheduling an outbound job.</p><p>If multiple available modems in a job's selected <strong>ModemGroup</strong> have the same <strong>ModemPriority</strong> value, then the \*(Fx scheduler assigns jobs to them in a round-robin fashion.</p>

    <p>Define the <em>state</em> transmitted to the \*(Fx scheduler process each time a modem is made ready by a <em>faxgetty</em> process. State is one of: ``R'' (ready for use), ``B'' (busy), or ``D'' (down). The modem state can be used to control whether or not modems are assigned to outbound jobs. A modem's state is initially set to ``R'' (ready). Modem state can be dynamically changed with the <a href="../man8/faxstate.8.html"><strong>faxstate</strong>(8)</a> program or by setting this configuration parameter with the <a href="../man8/faxconfig.8.html"><strong>faxconfig</strong>(8)</a> program.</p>

If page chopping is enabled, then pages with at least <strong>PageChopThreshold</strong> trailing whitespace on a page will be transmitted as a ``short page'' if the receiver is capable of accepting variable-length pages. The possible values are: ``last'' to enable chopping of the last page of each document, ``all'' to enable chopping of all pages, or ``none'' to disable page chopping.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>PageChopThreshold\(S1</strong></p>

    <p><strong>PollLockWait</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When polling for the presence/removal of a <small>UUCP</small> lockfile, the time (in seconds) to wait between checks. Lockfile polling occurs to ensure the fax server doesn't collide with another process using the modem.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Indicates whether the \*(Fx scheduler should utilize available priority job scheduling mechanisms to enhance realtime execution, particularly with Class 1 configurations on older or slower systems.</p><p>Currently <strong>PriorityScheduling</strong> is available for IRIX, SVR/4, HP-UX, and POSIX-compliant (i.e. Linux) operating systems.  The default value varies to maintain traditional \*(Fx behavior.  On IRIX, SVR/4, and HP-UX systems where the configure script detects one of the functions schedctl(), priocntl() or rtprio() the default is true. The only other supported priority mechanism is POSIX sched_setscheduler(), which is used on Linux, OpenServer and possibly other systems.  On such systems, as well as on systems where no priority scheduling mechanism exists, the default is false."</p>

    <p><strong>QualifyPWD</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A string that specifies whether or not the identity of calling facsimile machines should be checked against an access control list before receiving facsimile.

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The data format (compression scheme) to write received facsimile data when copy quality checking is performed on the host. (When copy quality checking is not done by the server, for example when error correction protocol is used, the received facsimile data is written exactly as it is received from the modem.) The format may be one: ``1-D MH'', ``2-D MR'', ``2-D MMR'', or ``adaptive''. An ``adaptive'' format causes the received data to be written using the data format negotiated by the sender and receiver. Note that while 2-D MMR is the most space-efficient data format the resultant file may not be viewable (certain commonly used programs do not properly read multi-strip TIFF with 2-D MMR data).</p>

    <p><strong>RTNHandlingMethod</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specifies how to react to an RTN signal received from the remote: one of ``\s-1Retransmit\s+1'', ``\s-1Giveup\s+1'',``\s-1Ignore\s+1'', or ``\s-1Retransmit-Ignore\s+1''.</p><p>``\s-1Retransmit\s+1'' assumes that the page is not received successfully. HylaFAX will make up to two additional attempts to send the page, decreasing signalling rate and retraining.  If RTN continues, up to 2 additional calls will be placed.  The downside is that if the remote always responds with RTN, the page will be sent 9 times and no following pages will be sent.  Many fax machines will not behave this way, although T.30 specification seems clear that this is the intent of the RTN signal.</p><p>Many fax machines will interpret RTN as meaning to not send the same data again.  That is because RTN may indicate problems with flow control, incorrectly encoded T.4 data, or some incompatibility other than line noise. Fax machines that interpret RTN this way will disconnect and require a manual retransmission.  This ``over and out'' behaviour can be activated by the ``\s-1Giveup\s+1'' value.  The advantage to this behavior is that the same page of image data will not be sent multiple times, but the downside is that the following pages will not be sent.</p><p>``\s-1Ignore\s+1'' is similar to ``\s-1Giveup\s+1'' in that it makes the assumption the data cannot be automatically accepted by the receiver.  However, rather than disconnecting the page of image data is abandoned and processing moves on to the next.  The remote is left to decide what to do with the unacceptable page of image data.  The downside to this behavior, is that the remote may or may not have kept the page, depending on its interpretation of the RTN signal - but it does allow us to continue on to the next page.</p><p>``\s-1Retransmit-Ignore\s+1'' is a combination of ``\s-1Retransmit\s+1'' and ``\s-1Ignore\s+1''.  The page of image data is retransmitted up to two additional times, but rather than disconnecting after a third RTN signal for the same page, processing then continues on to the next page.  This approach is an effort to satisfy both interpretations of an RTN signal.  It allows the receiver to hopefully receive a better copy of the image data while not failing to send subsequent pages. If the receiver saves or prints a copy of pages for which it transmits RTN, then it could save or print up to three copies of every page.</p>

<p>For example, to enable tracing of server operations and protocol operations, a value of 1+2=3 should be specified. <strong>NB: tracing timeouts and/or binary modem \s-1I/O\s+1 can adversely</strong> affect the operation of the fax server; enabling these areas should be done with extreme care.</p><ul>
<li><p>Server tracing is directed to <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html"><strong>syslog</strong>(3)</a> using the <em>facility</em> specified with the <strong>LogFacility</strong> configuration parameter. Note that <strong>syslogd</strong>(8) must be configured to capture <em>facility.info</em>, <em>facility.debug</em>, <em>facility.warning</em>, and <em>facility.err</em> messages.

  <dt>
    <p><strong>TagLineCoverNumString</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Setting TagLineCoverNumString instructs faxsend to not include the cover pages in the normal page numbering mechanism.  The page numbers used in the tagline generation will adjusted to not count the cover pages, and the TagLineCoverNumString value wil be used instead of a page number on the tagline of the cover page.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>TagLineFont</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The filename of the font to use in imaging <em>tag lines</em> across the top of each transmitted page. Fonts must be stored in the Portable Compiled Font ( .SM PCF ) format used by the X11 Window System. Filenames are specified relative to the root of the spooling area; e.g. etc/lutRS18.pcf. If no font is specified, if a null filename is specified, or if the specified font file is not readable, then tag lines will not be generated. See also <strong>TagLineFormat</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>TagLineFormat</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The format string to use when imaging <em>tag lines</em> across the top of each transmitted page. This string may include escape codes that cause various items to be interpolated into the imaged tag line. Any escape code supported by <em>strftime</em>(3C) may be used as well as the following server-implemented codes:</p>
<pre>
<strong>Escape</strong>	<strong>Description</strong>
%%a	destination subaddress
%%c	destination company name
%%C	sender's company name
%%d	destination phone number
%%g	destination geographic location
%%G	sender's geographic location
%%i	job identifier
%%I	group identifier
%%j	user-specified job tag
%%l	<strong>LocalIdentifier</strong> or canonicalized <strong>FAXNumber</strong>
%%m	sender's electronic mail address
%%n	canonicalized <strong>FAXNumber</strong>
%%p	current page number of session
%%P	current page number of job
%%r	receiver's name
%%s	sender's name
%%S	subject
%%t	total pages in session
%%T	total pages in job
%%v	destination voice number
%%V	sender's voice number
%%%	``%''
</pre>
<p>In addition, the format string may indicate that text is to be centered in multiple equal-sized <em>fields</em> by separating text with ``|'' characters. For example, ``a|b|c'' would cause the tag line to be broken up into three equal-sized areas with the strings ``a'', ``b'', and ``c'' centered within each region. The default tag line format string is ``From %%n|%c|Page %%P of %%T''. The differences between the %%p or %%P and the %%t or %%T options are noticed when a fax job is retried after an incomplete attempt and only the previously unsent pages are then queued in a successive session. See also <strong>TagLineFont</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>TIFF2FaxCmd\(S1</strong></p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>TimeOfDay\(S1</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The default time-of-day restrictions to apply to outbound jobs. Outbound jobs will be processed only during the specified time. Any jobs submitted outside this time period will be held until the start of this time. The syntax for time-of-day restrictions is designed to be compatible with the syntax used by the <small>UUCP</small> software. The following <small>BNF</small> describes the syntax:</p>
<pre>
   Syntax = tod ["," tod]
      tod = &lt;days&gt;&lt;timerange&gt;
     days = "Any" | "Wk" | &lt;dayname&gt;+ | nothing

      end = &lt;24hrtime&gt;
 24hrtime = {0-9}{0-9}{0-9}{0-9}
  nothing =
</pre>
<p>where <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> are 24-hour times, day names can be either 2- or 3-characters, and a null day or time specification means any time or day. White space and other syntactic sugar may be freely inserted between tokens but may not be inserted between 24-hour times in the time range.</p><ul>

    <p>The file protection mode that should be used when creating <small>UUCP</small> lockfiles. Note that this value is given in octal.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>UUCPLockDir\(S2</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The pathname of the directory in which <small>UUCP</small> lockfiles are to be created.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>UUCPLockTimeout\(S2</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The time in seconds to wait before removing a <em>stale</em> <small>UUCP</small> lockfile (i.e. a lockfile whose owner does not appear to exist). If this value is set to 0, then the fax server will never remove a stale lockfile.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>UUCPLockType\(S2</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A string that specifies the type of <small>UUCP</small> lockfile to create. The string may be one of ``ascii'' or ``binary'' depending on whether the process-ID of the lock owner is written to the file as an ascii string or as a binary value, respectively. In addition, two prefixes may be used to control the format of the lock filename. If the type string is prefixed with a ``+'', then <small>SVR4- style filenames are generated using the major device number of the</small> tty device and the major and minor device numbers for the filesystem on which the tty device resides. If the type string is prefixed with a ``-'', then any upper case letters in the device part of the lockfile name are converted to lower case letters; for example, ``LCK..ttyA01'' is converted to ``LCK..ttya01''. This upper-to-lower case conversion is useful for systems such as <small>SCO</small> where the convention is to name devices with upper-case letters, but create lockfiles with lower-case letters.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>VGettyArgs</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A string that indicates whether or not the server should invoke a voice getty program in response to an incoming voice call. If the string value is not null, then it is interpreted as a set of arguments to pass to the <em>vgetty</em> program. Before supplying the arguments, the string is first scanned for ``%''-escape sequences: any appearance of ``%l'' is replaced with the tty name and any appearance of ``%s'' is replaced with the serial port speed (in decimal). Any appearance of escaped numbers 1 through 9 (``%1'' through ``%9'') are replaced by the match to the corresponding <strong>CallIDPattern</strong>, if present. The ``%'' character can be specified with ``%%''. If the <strong>VGettyArgs</strong> parameter is not specified in the configuration file or if the string value is null, then voice connections will be rejected. Note that in addition to the specified command line arguments, the <em>vgetty</em> program is invoked with its standard input, output, and error descriptors directed to the controlling tty device.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">MODEM-ORIENTED CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>This section lists configuration parameters that are specific to the setup and operation of the modem. All <em>commands</em> must be specified exactly as they are to be transmitted to the modem (note that this is a departure from previous versions of this software that automatically prepended ``\s-1AT\s+1'' to each line of commands sent to the modem). When multi-line commands are required, enclose the commands in quote marks (``"'') and insert a newline character ``&#92;n'' where lines should be broken. An example of a multi-line command string is ``\s-1AT+FCQ=1&#92;nAT+FBADMUL=20&#92;nAT+FBADLIN=10\s+1''.</p><p>Command strings sent to the modem may include command escapes that force the host to alter the <small>DTE-DCE</small> communication rate, the flow control scheme used between the host and modem, delay for a period of time, flush input data, and wait for a specific response from the modem. The following escape codes are interpreted:</p>
<pre>
<strong>Escape</strong>	<strong>Effect</strong>
&lt;none&gt;	enable no flow control between \s-1DTE\s+1 and \s-1DCE\s+1
&lt;xon&gt;	enable software flow control between \s-1DTE\s+1 and \s-1DCE\s+1
&lt;rts&gt;	enable hardware flow control between \s-1DTE\s+1 and \s-1DCE\s+1
&lt;2400&gt;	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 2400 bps
&lt;4800&gt;	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 4800 bps
&lt;9600&gt;	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 9600 bps
&lt;19200&gt;	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 19200 bps
&lt;38400&gt;	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 38400 bps
&lt;57600&gt;	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 57600 bps
&lt;76800&gt;	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 76800 bps
&lt;115200&gt;	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 115200 bps
&lt;delay:N&gt;	delay N x 10 ms on the host (0 &lt;= N &lt;= 255)
&lt;flush&gt;	flush any pending input data from the modem
&lt;waitfor:R&gt;	wait for the response R from the modem (see below)
&lt;play:filename&gt;	play the specified audio file (see below)
</pre>
<p>Note that commands to the left of an escape code are sent to the modem before the associated actions are carried out on the host. This may be important when changing baud rates, as the result code from a command may be returned at the new baud rate. Also, beware that not all baud rates are supported by all systems and modems; the set of baud rates supported by a host is usually listed in <a href="../man1/stty.1.html"><strong>stty</strong>(1)</a>.</p><p>The ``&lt;waitfor:..&gt;'' escape can be used to override the default behaviour which is to wait for an ``\s-1OK\s+1'' response to a command sent to the modem. The possible response codes are:</p>
<pre>
\s-1NOTHING\s+1	a null response
\s-1OK\s+1	the default response
\s-1CONNECT\s+1	``\s-1CONNECT...\s+1''
\s-1NOANSWER\s+1	``\s-1NO ANSWER...\s+1''
\s-1NOCARRIER\s+1	``\s-1NO CARRIER...\s+1''
\s-1NODIALTONE\s+1	``\s-1NO DIALTONE...\s+1''
\s-1BUSY\s+1	``\s-1BUSY\s+1''
\s-1OFFHOOK\s+1	``\s-1PHONE OFF-HOOK\s+1''
\s-1RING\s+1	``\s-1RING...\s+1''
\s-1ERROR\s+1	error status from modem
\s-1VCON\s+1	voice connection indicator
\s-1OTHER\s+1	any unrecognized modem response
</pre>
<p>For example ``\s-1ATO&#92;r&lt;waitfor:CONNECT&gt;\s+1'' would send ``\s-1ATO\s+1&#92;r'' to the modem and then wait for a response with a leading ``\s-1CONNECT\s+1'' in it; and ``\s-1ATS99=2&#92;r&lt;delay:2&gt;&lt;flush&gt;&lt;waitfor:NOTHING&gt;\s+1'' would send ``\s-1ATS99=2&#92;r\s+1'' to the modem, delay 20 ms, flush any input from the modem, and then continue (not wait for any response).</p><p>The ``&lt;play:filename&gt;'' escape can be used to play a raw audio file with a voice modem.   This feature can be used, for example, to play a brief audio message after picking up the line but before answering.  A configuration example may be:</p>
<pre>
  ModemRingResponse:  "AT+FCLASS=8;H1&#92;nAT+VSM=131&#92;nAT+VLS=1&#92;nAT+VTX&#92;n&lt;waitfor:CONNECT&gt;&lt;play:/sounds/enter-extension.raw&gt;&lt;waitfor:OK&gt;AT+VTS=[933,,150]"
  ModemAnswerCmd:     "&lt;delay:100&gt;AT+FCLASS=1;A"
  CallIDPattern:      SHIELDED_DTMF
  CallIDAnswerLength: 4

</pre>
<p>In this example using an IS-101 voice-compliant modem, a RING indication from the modem will cause the modem to be placed in voice mode, set ulaw audio compression, and via the connected phone line play back the etc/play1.raw audio file, which may say, "After the tone enter a four-digit extension, then start the fax."  Following the message a tone is played.</p>
<dl class='dl-vertical'>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemAnswerCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to answer the phone. If possible, this command should generate a result string that identifies whether the incoming call is from a facsimile, voice, or data modem. Typically this auto-detection is configured ahead of time; e.g. for Class 2 modems with the ``\s-1AT+FAA=1\s+1'' command.</p><ul>

<p>The ``Default'' column indicates the interpretation made for the result string in either class 1 or 2 unless explicitly overridden. The ``Class 1'' column indicates result strings handled specially for modems operating in class 1, the ``Class 2'' column indicates special handling for modems operating in class 2, and the ``Class 2.0'' column indicates special handling for modems operating in class 2.0. <em>Unknown</em> entries imply that interpretation is based on the way in which the call was answered; if answering is done for an explicit call type, that type is assumed, otherwise a Fax call is presumed.</p></li>

    <p>The command to set the time, in seconds, that the modem should pause when encountering a ``,'' modifier in the dialing string.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemDialCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to place a phone call. The string is assumed to be suitable for use as a parameter to the <em>sprintf</em>(3S) function; so the ``%'' character should be escaped as ``%%''. The dial command must include a single ``%s'' where the number that is to be dialed is to be substituted. Facilities such as tone or pulse dialing, outgoing prefixes to route though a \s-1PBX\s+1, and so on should be included in the dialing command string. It is also important that, if possible, a trailing ``@'' symbol should be included so that the modem returns result codes that distinguish between no answer and no carrier. Use of the ``@'' permits the server to reduce the probability that a wrong number is continually redialed. If the modem does not support this facility, then it may be necessary to raise the number of retries done when a ``\s-1NO CARRIER\s+1'' result is returned.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemDialResponseTimeout</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, for a response from the modem after sending This value should be longer than the timeout programmed into the modem through the <strong>ModemWaitTimeCmd</strong> parameter. This additional server-based timeout is provided to guard against modems that can ``lock up'' when dialing the telephone.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemDoPhaseCDebug</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Whether or not to query the modem for responses during image data transmission.  Normally the modem should not produce any responses during Phase C data transmission.  However, in some debugging scenarios (i.e. some Class 2.1 modems may show debugging information) it may be appropriate to query the modem for responses during the data transmission.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemDTRDropDelay</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The time, in milliseconds, to pause between placing <small>DTR</small> OFF and <small>DTR</small> ON while resetting a modem.  This value should be at least equal to the time-value of the analogous S-register, usually S25.</p>

This value is used to select the string sent to the modem to initially establish <small>DTE-DCE</small> flow control; one of <strong>ModemNoFlowCmd</strong>, <strong>ModemSoftFlowCmd</strong>, and <strong>ModemHardFlowCmd</strong>. The current flow control setting is also used to select the appropriate flow control command to send to the modem when the software switches to Class 1, 2, or 2.0; see <strong>Class1HFLOCmd</strong>, <strong>Class1NFLOCmd</strong>, <strong>Class1SFLOCmd</strong>, <strong>Class2HFLOCmd</strong>, <strong>Class2NFLOCmd</strong>, and <strong>Class2SFLOCmd</strong>.</p><ul>
<li><p>The server supports both software and hardware flow control for Class 1, Class 2, and Class 2.0 modems. Whether to use hardware or software flow control depends on the capabilities of the modem and the host hardware and operating system. Communication rates above 9600 baud often require that hardware flow control be used for reliable <small>DTE-DCE</small> communication. However, beware that many modems only support software flow control when sending or receiving facsimile.</p></li><li><p>Note that modems usually support software flow control even if they have no explicit AT-command to activate it; in this case it is switched on when the modem enters fax mode, having AT+FCLASS=... from \s-1DTE\s+1.</p></li>

    <p><strong>ModemRaiseATCommands</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Indicates whether or not all configuration AT commands for the modem should be raised to upper-case automatically.  The standard is for all upper-case to be used in AT commands, and indeed, some rare modems have been known to malfunction with lower-case commands.

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemReadyCmds</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A string of commands to issue to the modem during reception initialization. This string is sent to the modem <em>after</em> the standard set of configuration commands required by the fax server.  This is done, for example, to un-busy a DID line so that calls can come through.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemRecvFillOrder</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The bit order to expect for received facsimile data. This value may be either <small>LSB2MSB</small> when bits are ordered from least-significant-bit to most-significant-bit (as in the <small>CCITT</small> specification) or <small>MSB2LSB</small> when bits are ordered in the reverse direction. According to the various specifications all modems should return data in <small>LSB2MSB</small> order. However most Class 2 modems (except maybe only Multitech) use <small>MSB2LSB</small> for compatibility with modems that were built with Rockwell hardware/firmware that included a bug that was too widespread to correct.</p><ul>
<li><p>If this parameter is not set, then it is autodetected and set to <small>LSB2MSB</small> for Class 1 and Class 2.0 modems and <small>MSB2LSB</small> for non-Multitech Class 2 modems. However this may be wrong for your modem, so you will have to specify this parameter explicitly.</p></li>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A string of commands to issue to the modem during initialization. This string is sent to the modem <em>before</em> the standard set of configuration commands required by the fax server. Note that these commands <strong>should not include normal</strong> reset commands that are specified through other parameters. For example, commands to setup flow control, <small>DCD</small> handling, <small>DTR</small> handling, etc. should be specified through the appropriate configuration parameters and not through this parameter. In addition the soft reset command (usually ``\s-1ATZ\s+1'') should not be included in this string; the servers issue this command explicitly.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemResetDelay</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The time, in milliseconds, to pause after setting <small>DTR</small> ON, while resetting a modem. <small>DTR</small> ON does not respond with ``OK'', so this parameter should be long enough to allow the modem time to be ready for <strong>ModemSoftResetCmd</strong> successively.</p>
  </dd>

If the parameter begins with a ``!'', then the remainder of the string is taken to be the identification string and no command is issued to the modem.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemSendBeginCmd</strong></p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemSendFillOrder</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The bit order the modem expects for transmitted facsimile data. This value may be either <small>LSB2MSB</small> or <small>MSB2LSB</small> (see also <strong>ModemRecvFillOrder</strong> above.) Virtually all modems expect transmitted facsimile data in <small>LSB2MSB</small> bit order.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemSetVolumeCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The commands to use to set the modem speaker volume levels. There should be five whitespace-separated commands, one each for setting the volume to ``Off'', ``Quiet'', ``Low'', ``Medium'', and ``High''; the default is ``"\s-1ATM0 ATL0M1 ATL1M1 ATL2M1 ATL3M1\s+1"''. See also <strong>SpeakerVolume</strong>.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemSetupAACmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to setup <em>adaptive answer</em> support in the modem-if available. Adaptive answer is the term used for the ability to distinguish between calls from facsimile, voice, and data sources. Note that this string is the last command issued by the device drivers during setup, so the command string may, if necessary, switch to a different operating mode (e.g. on some Rockwell-based modems it is necessary to issue the ``\s-1AT+FAA=1\s0'' command in Class 0).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemSetupDCDCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to setup <small>DCD</small> handling. On most systems the facsimile server will enable the \s-1CLOCAL\s+1 flag on the tty device to which the modem is connected. This should insure that the system does not close an open file descriptor associated with the modem if carrier is dropped. Thus, for most systems and modems <strong>ModemSetupDCDCmd</strong> should setup <small>DCD</small> to reflect carrier.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemSetupDTRCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to setup <small>DTR</small> handling so that the modem is reset when the <small>DTR</small> signal is lowered by the host. The facsimile server uses this facility to insure that modems are not left in a ``locked up'' state.</p>
  </dd>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemSoftRTFCC</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Whether or not to enable software-driven Real-Time Fax Compression Conversion. RTFCC allows HylaFAX to convert the image compression between MH MR and MMR formats regardless of how faxq formatted the image file. Note that when using RTFCC, the compression format of the file will be ignored, thus the ``-1'', ``-2'', and ``-3'' options for sendfax, ps2fax, and others will only influence how the document is prepared by faxq and will not influence the actual negotiated session parameters. <strong>Class2RTFCC</strong> takes precedence over <strong>ModemSoftRTFCC</strong> and if both are enabled, then software-driven RTFCC will not be performed in favor of the firmware-driven RTFCC.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemType</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This parameter must be set to one of: ``Class2'', ``Class2.0'', or ``Class1''; to indicate that the modem is a Class 2-, Class 2.0-, or Class 1-style modem, respectively. If this parameter is not set, then it is autodetected and the highest supported fax class is used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemVerboseResultsCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to enable verbose, as opposed to numeric, result codes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemWaitForConnect</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If enabled, the facsimile server will not consider a connection established when answering an incoming call until a ``\s-1CONNECT\s+1'' status string is received. This is useful mainly for Rockwell \s-1RC32ACL\s+1-based modems that send ``\s-1FAX\s+1'' and ``\s-1DATA\s+1'' status messages before sending ``\s-1CONNECT\s+1''.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>ModemWaitTimeCmd</strong></p>

    <p>The command used to stop and wait before sending the post page message, except before sending EOP, when <strong>Class1EOPWaitCmd</strong> is used instead.  We must ensure that the high-speed carrier has stopped completely. According to T.30, Chapter 5, Note 4, this delay should be 75 +/- 20 ms.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1ResponseWaitCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command used to stop and wait after sending TCF, before attempting to receive a training response from the remote.  Set this to ``AT+FRS=1'' if you experience ``DIS/DTC received 3 times'' errors.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1Resolutions</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A bitmapped (bit-or'd) value indicating the resolutions to be supported during facsimile operation.  Individual resolutions follow Table 21/T.32 and are defined as follows:</p>
<pre>
<strong>Bit	Description</strong>
0 (0x00)	R8 x 3.85 l/mm, Normal
1 (0x01)	R8 x 7.7 l/mm, Fine
2 (0x02)	R8 x 15.4 l/mm, Superfine
4 (0x04)	R16 x 15.4 l/mm, Hyperfine
8 (0x08)	200 dpi x 100 l/inch
16 (0x10)	200 dpi x 200 l/inch
32 (0x20)	200 dpi x 400 l/inch
64 (0x40)	300 dpi x 300 l/inch

</pre>
<p>Thus, a value of 3 would indicate support for normal, fine, and superfine resolutions.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1RMQueryCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to send to the modem to get the list of supported reception bit-rates. If the parameter begins with a ``!'', then the remainder of the string is taken to be the modem response and no command is issued to the modem.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1TCFWaitCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command used to stop and wait before sending TCF, similar to <strong>Class1PPMWaitCmd.</strong> According to T.30, Chapter 5, Note 3, this delay should be 75 +/- 20 ms.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1TMQueryCmd</strong></p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1EOPWaitCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command used to stop and wait before sending the post page message similar to <strong>Class1PPMWaitCmd.</strong> We allow a different setting in the case of EOP, however, because empirically some machines may need more time.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1ModemHasDLEBug</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Used to indicate that the modem does not correctly duplicate DLE characters in the V.21 communication to the DTE.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1MsgRecvHackCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If receive failures occur due to +FCERROR just prior to image data reception, setting <strong>Class1MsgRecvHackCmd</strong> to AT+FRS=1 may help.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1RecvAbortOK</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The time, in milliseconds, to wait for an ``\s-1OK\s+1'' result code from the modem after aborting an <small>HDLC</small> frame receive (``\s-1AT+FRH=3\s+1''). If this number is zero, then the modem is assumed to not correctly implement aborting and instead the driver will wait 200ms, flush any input, and then send ``\s-1AT&#92;n\s+1'' and wait 100ms for an ``\s-1OK\s+1'' result.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1RecvIdentTimer</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The time, in milliseconds, to wait for an initial <small>DCS</small> when receiving a facsimile. <small>CCITT</small> recommendation <small>T.30</small> specifies this as the value of the <small>T1</small> timer. However, adaptive answering schemes such as that described above under the <strong>AdaptiveAnswer</strong> parameter may require that this timer be shortened.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1RMPersistence</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The number of times that an attempt to receive the high-speed data carrier should be made, resulting in +FCERROR, before the low-speed message carrier reception is attempted.  Some modems are quick to (perhaps incorrectly) return +FCERROR, and for those modems a value of 2 or 3 should be used. For modems that are not quick to return +FCERROR, a value of 1 should be used. Proper tuning of this can provide a type of "adaptive reception control" for modems that accurately return +FCERROR without supporting <strong>Class1AdaptRecvCmd.</strong> For those modems that support <strong>Class1AdaptRecvCmd,</strong> <strong>Class1RMPersistence</strong> should probably not be set at 1, although +FCERROR should almost never occur with such modems.</p><ul>
<li><p>If the modem does not support the reporting of +FCERROR or adaptive reception control, then <strong>Class1RMPersistence</strong> should probably be set at 0, which causes the timeout looking for the high-speed data carrier to be shortened, thus increasing the likelihood of recovery from any dissynchronization. When <strong>Class1RMPersistence</strong> is other than 0 it is assumed that the +FCERROR reporting or <strong>Class1AdaptRecvCmd</strong> is functional and therefore the timeout looking for the high-speed data carrier is lengthened.</p></li>
</ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1SwitchingCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command used to ensure that the sending facsimile device has turned off its modulator (i.e. loss-of-carrier) as recommended by T.31: Appendix II.1.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1SFLOCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to setup software (\s-1XON/XOFF\s+1) flow control between <small>DTE</small> and <small>DCE</small> when operating in Class 1. This command is issued immediately after sending the <strong>Class1Cmd</strong> to switch the modem to Class 1 operation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1TCFMaxNonZero</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum percentage of non-zero data bytes permitted in an acceptable received <small>TCF.</small> Note that this number does not include any leading non-zero data in the received data. See also <strong>Class1TCFMinRun</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1TCFMinRun</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The duration, in milliseconds, of the minimum run of zero data in an acceptable received <small>TCF.</small> This value should be specified according to a 1.5 second transmission of zero data (i.e. it should be between 0 and 1500). See also <strong>Class1TCFMaxNonZero</strong> and <strong>Class1TCFMinRunECMMod</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1TCFMinRunECMMod</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The factor by which <strong>Class1TCFMinRun</strong> should be modified in the case of an ECM session.  As ECM protocol allows retransmissions it is commonly faster to accept a lesser-quality data stream and the subsequent retransmisisons than it is to allow the communication speed to slow down (where the demodulation may still not produce an ideal data stream, anyway).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1TCFRecvHackCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If receive failures occur due to +FCERROR just prior to TCF data reception, setting <strong>Class1TCFRecvHackCmd</strong> to AT+FRS=1 may help.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1TCFRecvTimeout</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, for the first byte and again for the entirety of the Training Check ( .SM TCF ) message data that is received during the training phase of the facsimile reception protocol.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1TMConnectDelay</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The time, in milliseconds, to delay after receiving CONNECT following +FTM before sending image data.  T.31 8.3.3 requires the modem to respond with CONNECT before the modulation training pattern.  If transmission begins before the remote has successfully completed its own modulation training pattern then data, especially during TCF, could be lost.  Many modems do not follow T.31 in this regard, and thus the default is zero; however its use with such modems would likely have a negligible effect.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class1ValidateV21Frames</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Whether or not to use the FCS bits of received V.21 HDLC frames to check the validity of the frame itself.  Most Class 1 modems perform this check independently (per T.31 7.4) and do not require this feature to be enabled.</p>

  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2AbortCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to use to abort an established session. After using this command to abort a session, the fax software will send <strong>ModemOnHookCmd</strong> and then reset the modem by dropping <small>DTR .</small></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2APCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1, standards.  This command would be used to enable sending and receiving SUB, SEP, and PWD frames.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2APQueryCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1, standards.  This command would be used to query the capabilities of sending and receiving SUB, SEP, and PWD frames. The value ``none'' may be used if the modem does not support any <strong>Class2APQueryCmd.</strong></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2BORCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to setup the bit order of sent and received facsimile data. Usually the command ``\s-1AT+FBOR=0\s+1'' is used so that data is sent and received in <em>direct</em> bit order (\s-1LSB2MSB\s+1). Some modems, such as the Everex 24/96D, must use reversed bit order for Phase B and D data exchanges to avoid a bug that results in garbage data being placed in the padding of <small>EOL</small> codes. The bit order specified by this command must correspond to the settings of the <strong>ModemSendFillOrder</strong> and <strong>ModemRecvFillOrder</strong> parameters.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2BUGCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to use to enable or disable the tracing of <small>HDLC</small> frames sent and received by the modem. This tracing information should be returned to the host in ``\s-1+FHR:\s+1'' and ``\s-1+FHT:\s+1'' status strings. Note that many Class 2 modems do not support this facility, which is largely used for diagnostic purposes. The value ``none'' may be used if the modem does not support any <strong>Class2BUGCmd.</strong></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2CIGCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command used to set a polling identifier. This string is inserted into the format ``\s-1%s="&lt;id&gt;"\s+1''.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2CQCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to use to set up parameters for copy quality checking. For example, for an Everex 24/96D modem this parameter might be set to ``\s-1AT+FCQ=1&#92;nAT+FBADMUL=20&#92;nAT+FBADLIN=10\s+1''. <strong>Class2CQCmd</strong> should be configured to set-up all available copy quality services available per <strong>Class2CQQueryCmd.</strong> To disable features that are available, configure <strong>Class2CQQueryCmd</strong> with a ``!'', and then set <strong>Class2CQCmd</strong> accordingly.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2CQQueryCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to send to the modem to get the copy quality capabilities string. If the parameter begins with a ``!'', then the remainder of the string is taken to be the capabilities string and no command is issued to the modem; this can be used together with the <strong>Class2CQCmd</strong> to force copy quality checking to be done in the server instead of in the modem. See also <strong>PercentGoodLines</strong> and <strong>MaxConsecutiveBadLines</strong> for parameters used to do server copy quality checking.  If copy quality checking is configured to be done by the modem then it is not done by the server.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2CRCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to use to enable the reception of facsimile.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2DCCQueryCmd</strong></p>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2DDISCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to set session parameters before dialing. This string is inserted into the format ``\s-1%s=vr,br,wd,ln,df,ec,bf,st\s+1''. Setting this parameter enables support for Class 2 modems that do not properly implement the ``\s-1AT+FDIS\s+1'' command by setting up session parameters before dialing the telephone.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2DISCmd</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Class2ECMType</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The interpretation of the EC parameter in the modem DCC response varies between the Class 2, ``2'', and Class 2.0, ``2.0'', specifications.  This configuration parameter allows the administrator to specify which type to use.  The corresponding specification type is used by default.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2HexNSF</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Whether or not to parse the NSF strings reported by the modem using hexadecimal values.  By default, they are parsed as hexadecimal values.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>The command to setup hardware (\s-1RTS/CTS\s+1) flow control between <small>DTE</small> and <small>DCE</small> when operating in Class 2/2.0. This command is issued immediately after sending the <strong>Class2Cmd</strong> to switch the modem to Class 2/2.0 operation. For Class 2.0 operation the default is ``\s-1AT+FLO=2\s+1''.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2JPEGSupport</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Whether or not to enable and utilize the JPEG support found in the modem.</p>
  </dd>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to setup no flow control between <small>DTE</small> and <small>DCE</small> when operating in Class 2/2.0. This command is issued immediately after sending the <strong>Class2Cmd</strong> to switch the modem to Class 2 operation. For Class 2.0 operation the default is ``\s-1AT+FLO=0\s+1''.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2NRCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(<em>Class 2.0 only</em>) The command to setup negotiation message reporting. For the correct operation of the Class 2.0 driver this command must enable the reporting of: receiver parameters, transmitter parameters, and ID strings. It is not necessary to enable reporting of non-standard frames for correct operation of the Class 2.0 driver.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2PACmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1, standards.  This command would be used to set up the polling address string enabled by the <strong>Class2APCmd</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2PHCTOCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to use to set the Phase C timeout parameter (in seconds). The value ``none'' may be used if the modem does not support any <strong>Class2PHCTOCmd.</strong></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2PIECmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(<em>Class 2.0 only</em>) The command to use to control procedure interrupt handling. Procedure interrupts should be disabled because \*(Fx does not provide a mechanism for dispatching procedure interrupts to an administrator.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2PTSCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to use to set the received page status code. When copy quality checking is done in the host, this command may be used to control the post-page response delivered to the sender. Beware that some modems do not properly implement this command in which case the server should be configured to not do copy quality check: see the <strong>PercentGoodLines</strong> and <strong>MaxConsecutiveBadLines</strong> parameters to understand how to defeat copy quality checking.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2PTSQueryCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to use to query the received page status code. This command may be used to determine the post-page response returned from the receiver. Beware that some modems do not properly implement this command in which case this setting should be set to ``none''.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2PWCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1, standards.  This command would be used to set up the password string enabled by the <strong>Class2APCmd</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2RecvDataTrigger</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The character to send to the modem to trigger the transmission of received data from the modem to the host. This character is specified to be <small>DC1</small> (octal 21) in the draft specification 2388-A and <small>DC2</small> (octal 22) in the 2388-B specification. Most Class 2 modems accept <small>DC1</small> or both <small>DC1</small> and <small>DC2.</small> Some modems however only accept <small>DC2.</small> Note that string parameters may use C-style escape sequences, so <small>DC2,</small> for example, would be specified as ``"&#92;022"''.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2RELCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to use to enable the delivery of byte-aligned <small>EOL</small> codes in received facsimile. If this parameter is defined, then received facsimile data will be marked to indicate that <small>EOL</small> codes are byte-aligned; otherwise they will be marked as not (necessarily) having byte-aligned codes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2RTFCC</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Whether or not to enable MultiTech's Real-Time Fax Compression Conversion which is available in later firmware revisions for the MT5634ZBA-V92, MT5634ZPX-PCI-V92, and other models.  RTFCC allows HylaFAX to convert the image compression between MH MR and MMR formats regardless of how faxq formatted the image file.  If RTFCC is available with your firmware, then the response to ``AT+FFC=?'' is non-zero.  Note that when using RTFCC, the compression format of the file will be ignored, thus the ``-1'', ``-2'', and ``-3'' options for sendfax, ps2fax, and others will not influence the actual negotiated session parameters.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2SACmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1, standards.  This command would be used to set up the destination subaddress string enabled by the <strong>Class2APCmd</strong>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2SendRTC</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Whether or not to append an explicit ``Return To Control'' (\s-1RTC\s+1) signal to the page data when transmitting. The Class 2 and Class 2.0 specs (i.e. SP-2388-A and TIA/EIA-592) state that the modem will append <small>RTC</small> when it receives the post-page message command from the host; this parameter is provided in case the modem does not correctly implement this.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2SFLOCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to setup software (\s-1XON/XOFF\s+1) flow control between <small>DTE</small> and <small>DCE</small> when operating in Class 2/2.0. This command is issued immediately after sending the <strong>Class2Cmd</strong> to switch the modem to Class 2/2.0 operation. For Class 2.0 operation the default is ``\s-1AT+FLO=1\s+1''.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2SPLCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to use to enable a polling request. The value ``none'' may be used if the modem does not support any <strong>Class2SPLCmd.</strong></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2TBCCmd</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command to use to enable stream-mode communication between the host and modem. The value ``none'' may be used if the modem does not support any <strong>Class2TBCCmd.</strong></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2UseLineCount</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Whether or not to use the line count reported to HylaFAX by the modem firmware decoder.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2UseHex</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Whether or not to parse the capabilities strings reported by the modem using hexadecimal values.  By default, they are parsed as decimal values.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p><strong>Class2XmitWaitForXON</strong></p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Whether or not to wait for an <small>XON</small> character from the modem before sending facsimile data to the modem for transmission. Note that this is only relevant for modems that conform to the Class 2 spec (i.e. SP-2388-A). The Class 2.0 specification states that the host may transmit data immediately upon receiving <small>CONNECT</small> and that no <small>XON</small> character will be sent to the host.</p>

        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">PROTOTYPE CONFIGURATION FILES</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>Per-modem configuration files are typically derived from prototype files that have been created for known modems. These prototype files are kept in the <strong>config</strong> subdirectory and, by convention, have names that identify a brand or type of modem and the <small>DTE-DCE</small> flow control scheme the prototype files configures. The <a href="../man8/faxaddmodem.8.html"><strong>faxaddmodem</strong>(8)</a> program that is used to configure a modem for use with \*(Fx selects a prototype configuration file using information retrieved from the modem and comments embedded in the prototype files. For Class 1 modems the product ID code returned by the command ``\s-1ATI0\s+1'' and the response from the command ``\s-1ATI3\s+1'' are used to select a prototype configuration file, while for Class 2 modems the manufacturer and model as returned by ``\s-1AT+FMFR?\s+1'' and ``\s-1AT+FMDL?\s+1'', respectively, are used (or ``\s-1AT+FMI?\s+1'' and ``\s-1AT+FMM?\s+1'' for Class 2.0 modems).</p><p>A Class 1 prototype configuration file is identified for use by <em>faxaddmodem</em> by searching for a comment of the form:</p>
<pre>
# CONFIG:CLASS1:144:.*:RTSCTS: Manufacturer='AT&T' Model=Dataport

</pre>
<p>In this example ``144'' is the product ID code for an \s-1AT&T\s+1 DataPort modem, ``.*'' is a regular expression matched against the result string returned by the ``\s-1ATI3\s+1'' command, and ``\s-1RTSCTS\s+1'' indicates the modem is configured to use hardware flow control during fax operation. The remainder of the line is evaluated by the <em>sh</em>(1) and used to specify the modem's manufacturer and model (since Class 1 modems do not have standard commands to query this information).</p><p>Class 2 and 2.0 prototype configuration files match the string ``<em>manufacturer</em>-<em>model</em>-<em>flowcontrol</em>'' against a <em>sh</em>(1) glob pattern specified in the configuration file, where <em>manufacturer</em> and <em>model</em> are the strings returned by querying the modem and <em>flowcontrol</em> is either ``\s-1RTSCTS\s+1'' for hardware flow control or ``\s-1XONXOFF\s+1'' for software flow control. For example:</p><p># CONFIG: CLASS2: ZyXEL*-RTSCTS</p><p># CONFIG: CLASS2.0: USRobotics*-XONXOFF</p><p>are configuration comments that appear in the prototype file for a \s-1ZyXEL 1496E\s+1 with Class 2 support, and for a US Robotics Courier modem with Class 2.0 firmware.</p><p>The <em>faxaddmodem</em> program merges server-specific configuration parameters into a prototype configuration according to comments placed in the prototype file. All lines between ``\s-1BEGIN-SERVER\s+1'' and ``\s-1END-SERVER\s+1'' comments are placed with the appropriate server configuration parameters. Note that this means modem-related configuration parameters must be placed outside this area of the file.</p>
