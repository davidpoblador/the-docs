        <h2 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">findlib.conf</h2>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
<p>The directory containing findlib.conf is determined at build time (by  running the configure script), the fallback default is  /usr/local/etc . You can set a different location by  changing the environment variable OCAMLFIND_CONF  which must contain the absolute path of findlib.conf. .PP The file has the same syntax as META , i.e. it consists of a  number of lines with the format </p>
<pre>
variable .ft B
&nbsp;=&nbsp;" .ft I
value .ft B
" .ft R
</pre>
<p>Here is the list of allowed variables: </p><p>path .RE</p><p>The search path for META files/package directories. The variable   enumerates directories which are separated by colons (Windows:   semicolons), and these directories are tried in turn to find a certain   package. More exactly, if d is such a directory and p the searched   package, the search algorithm will first check whether d/p/META   exists. In this case, this META file is taken, and d/p is the package   directory. Second, the algorithm tries d/META.p, but the package   directory must be specified in this META.p file by a </p><p>directory  directive. </p><p>Note that the first found META file is taken, so the order of the   directories in the search path counts. </p><p>This variable is required. </p><p>Example: </p>
<pre>
path&nbsp;=&nbsp;"/usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib:/usr/lib/ocaml/site-lib" .ft R
</pre>
<p>destdir .RE</p><p>This variable determines the location where ocamlfind   install  puts the packages by default: If d is this   directory, and p the package to install, a new subdirectory d/p will   be created containing all the files of the package. </p><p>Example: </p>
<pre>
destdir&nbsp;=&nbsp;"/usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib" .ft R
</pre>
<p>This variable is required. </p><p>metadir .RE</p><p>If set, the command ocamlfind install  will put the   META files of packages into this directory (files are named META.p   where p=package name); otherwise the META files are put into the   package directories like any other file. </p><p>Example: </p>
<pre>
metadir&nbsp;=&nbsp;"/var/lib/findlib/metaregistry" .ft R
</pre>
<p>This variable is optional. It is not used by default. </p><p>ocamlc , </p><p>ocamlopt , </p><p>ocamlcp , </p><p>ocamlmktop , </p><p>ocamldoc , </p><p>ocamldep , </p><p>ocamlbrowser </p><p>If you want to call other executables than "ocamlc", "ocamlopt",   "ocamlcp", "ocamlmktop", "ocamldoc", "ocamldep", and   "ocamlbrowser", you can   set the names of   the executables here. The command ocamlfind  looks   into these four variables to determine the names of the compilers to   call. </p><p>Example: </p>
<pre>
ocamlc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;"ocamlc.opt" 

ocamlopt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;"ocamlopt.opt" 

ocamlcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;"ocamlcp.opt" 

ocamlmktop&nbsp;=&nbsp;"ocamlmktop.opt" .ft R
</pre>
<p>This variable is optional. It is not used by default. </p><p>stdlib .RE</p><p>This variable determines the location of the standard library. This must   be the same directory for which the O'Caml compilers are configured. </p><p>This variable is optional. It is not recommend to set this variable   unless you know what you are doing! </p><p>ldconf .RE</p><p>This variable determines the location of the ld.conf file. This must   be the same file the O'Caml compilers read in; it is updated by</p><p> ocamlfind when installing and removing packages. You can set this   variable to the special value " ignore " to disable   the automatic modification of the ld.conf file. </p><p>If not set, the ld.conf file is assumed to reside in the O'Caml   standard library directory. </p><p>This variable is optional. It is not recommended to set this variable   unless you know what you are doing! </p><p>Toolchains: It is possible to have variants of the original configuration.  These variants are called "toolchains" because they are intended to  select different compilers, e.g. patched compilers. In order to  set a variable for a certain toolchain, use the syntax </p>
<pre>
variable .ft B
( .ft I
toolchain .ft B
)&nbsp;=&nbsp;" .ft I
value .ft B
" .ft R
</pre>
<p>For example: </p>
<pre>
ocamlc(mypatch)&nbsp;=&nbsp;"ocamlc-mypatch" .ft R
</pre>
<p>When the toolchain "mypatch" is selected, this compiler will be used instead  of the standard one. .PP In order to switch to a certain toolchain, use the -toolchain  option of ocamlfind . .SH "Environment" A number of environment variables modifies the behaviour of  findlib/ocamlfind: </p><p>OCAMLFIND_CONF .RE</p><p>This variable overrides the location of the configuration file   findlib.conf. It must contain the absolute path name of this file. </p><p>OCAMLPATH .RE</p><p>This variable may contain an additional search path for package   directories. It is treated as if the directories were prepended to   the configuration variable path . </p><p>OCAMLFIND_DESTDIR .RE</p><p>This variable overrides the configuration variable </p><p>destdir .</p><p>OCAMLFIND_METADIR .RE</p><p>This variable overrides the configuration variable </p><p>metadir .</p><p>OCAMLFIND_COMMANDS .RE</p><p>This variable overrides the configuration variables </p><p>ocamlc , ocamlopt , </p><p>ocamlcp , ocamlmktop , </p><p>ocamldoc , ocamldep , and/or </p><p>ocamlbrowser .</p><p> Its value must conform to the syntax </p>
<pre>
ocamlc= .ft I
name .ft B
&nbsp;ocamlopt= .ft I
name .ft B
&nbsp;ocamlcp= .ft I
name .ft B
&nbsp;ocamlmktop= .ft I

&nbsp;ocamldoc= .ft I
name .ft B
&nbsp;ocamldep= .ft I
name .ft B
&nbsp;ocamlbrowser= .ft I

</pre>
<p>Example: </p>
<pre>
ocamlc=ocamlc-3.00&nbsp;ocamlopt=ocamlopt-3.00&nbsp;ocamlcp=ocamlcp-3.00&nbsp;ocamlmktop=ocamlmktop-3.00 .ft R
</pre>
<p>CAMLLIB  or OCAMLLIB .RE</p><p>This variable overrides the configuration variable </p><p>stdlib .</p><p>OCAMLFIND_LDCONF .RE</p><p>This variable overrides the configuration variable </p><p>ldconf .</p><p>OCAMLFIND_IGNORE_DUPS_IN .RE</p><p>This variable instructs findlib not to emit warnings that packages   or module occur several times. The variable must be set to the   directory where the packages reside that are to be ignored for this   warning. </p>
